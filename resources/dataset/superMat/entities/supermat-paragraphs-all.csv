"1","PR06014617-CC","1","The absolute values and temperature, T, dependence of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth, λ ab , of La2−xSrxCuO4 and HgBa2CuO 4+δ have been measured as a function of carrier concentration. We find that the superfluid density, ρs, changes substantially and systematically with doping. The values of ρs(0) are closely linked to the available low energy spectral weight as determined by the electronic entropy just above Tc and the initial slope of ρs(T )/ρs(0) increases rapidly with carrier concentration. The results are discussed in the context of a possible relationship between ρs and the normal-state (or pseudo) energy gap.","0"
"2","PR06014617-CC","2","Superconductivity arises from the binding of electrons into Cooper pairs thereby forming a superfluid with a superconducting energy gap, ∆, in the single-particle ex- citation spectrum. In high-temperature superconductors (HTS) ∆ has essentially d x 2 −y 2 symmetry in k-space with ∆ k = ∆ 0 cos(2φ) , where φ = arctan(k y /k x ) and ∆ 0 is the superconducting gap amplitude which will in gen- eral be φ dependent. Changes in carrier concentration affect the superconducting and normal state (NS) properties of HTS and there is evidence that in addition to ∆ k there is a normal state (or pseudo) gap, ∆ N , in the NS energy excitation spectrum in under-and optimally doped samples which increases with decreasing doping. The maximum gap amplitude shows little vari- ation with underdoping even though T c is reduced , in disagreement with the standard mean-field Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. This unusual behaviour is probably linked to the presence of ∆ N . However, fundamental problems such as the origin of ∆ N and its possible effect on the superfluid density, ρ s , have not been clearly resolved experimentally or theoretically.","0"
"3","PR06014617-CC","3","The physical quantity most directly associated with ρ s is the magnetic penetration depth λ. Appropriate systems to investigate ρ s as a function of doping are La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 and HgBa 2 CuO 4+δ .

"4","PR06014617-CC","4","Single-phase polycrystalline samples of LSCO were prepared in Cambridge using solid-state reaction proce- dures. No other phases were detected by powder x-ray diffraction and the phase purity is thought to be bet- ter than 1%. Lattice parameters were in good agreement with published work . High field magnetic susceptibil- ity measurements showed no signatures of excess param- agnetic centres. The measured T c 's are 30, 37.7, 36, 27.5 and 20.3 K for x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.22 and 0.24, re- spectively. These values are also in very good agreement with previous measurements . µSR experiments as a function of T were performed on the same powders for x = 0.10 and 0.15. Although unoriented powders can be used to determine λ ab by µSR , the acs technique re- quires the powders to be magnetically aligned . To eliminate grain agglomerates, powders were ball-milled in ethanol and dried after adding a defloculant. Scan- ning electron microscopy confirmed the absence of grain boundaries and showed that the average grain diameter was ∼ 5µm. The powders were mixed with a 5 min curing epoxy and aligned in a static field of 12T at room tem- perature. Debye-Scherrer x-ray scans showed that ∼ 90% of the grains were aligned within ∼ 2.0 o . Low-field sus- ceptibility measurements were performed at an ac-field H ac = 1 G rms (parallel to the c-axis) and a frequency f = 333 Hz down to 1.2K. Details of the application of London's model for deriving λ from the measured sus- ceptibility can be found in an earlier publication . Transverse-field-cooled µSR experiments were performed at 400 Gauss in the ISIS, Rutherford-Appleton Labora- tory. The field produced a flux-line lattice whose field distribution was probed by muons. The depolarisation rate, σ(T ), of the initial muon spin is proportional to λ ab −2 (T ) . Checks were made to ensure that the values of λ ab obtained were independent of the applied field. The Hg-1201 [δ = 0.10 (T c = 60K) and 0.37 (T c = 35K)] samples were prepared in Houston by the con- trolled solid-vapour reaction technique . The values of λ ab (0) derived from the acs data for LSCO are 0.28, 0.26, 0.197, 0.193, 0.194 µm for x = p = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.22 and 0.24, respectively. Here p is the hole content per planar copper atom. The esti- mated error for λ ab (0) obtained by the acs technique is ±15% and within this uncertainty the λ ab (0) values agree with the µSR measurements. We thus find that λ −2 ab (0) is strongly suppressed on the underdoped side, including optimal doping, but there is no suppression with increas- ing overdoping (up to p = 0.24) in contrast to reports for Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ. Values of λ ab (0) as obtained by µSR for Hg-1201 are 0.194 and 0.148 µm for δ = 0.10 and 0.37, respectively. We note that δ = 0.10 and 0.37 in Hg-1201 correspond to p = 0.075 and 0.22, respectively .","1"

Overall there is good agreement between the results from the two techniques. From the acs data we find that the initial linear term in λ ab (T ), characteristic of a clean d-wave superconductor, persists up to the highest doping measured (x = 0.24) in agreement with electronic specific heat studies on polycrystalline LSCO samples from the same batch as those studied here . Figure de- picts data for Hg-1201 powders measured only by µSR, including data from Ref. for a Hg-1201 sample (also from Houston) with δ = 0.154 (p = 0.17). As in LSCO, we observe a change in the shape of σ(T ) ∝ [1/λ ab (T )] 2 of Hg-1201 with doping. Namely, in the underdoped region [1/λ ab (T )] 2 shows a more pronounced curvature. Taking the slope of the low-T linear term to be proportional to ρ s (0)/∆ 0 the observed trend of [1/λ ab (T )] 2 with p would imply that ∆ 0 remains approximately constant in the un- derdoped region and decreases rapidly with overdoping.","0"
"6","PR06014617-CC","6","Figure shows a comparison of the present results for LSCO with specific heat data taken on the same samples where ∆ N was observed for x = p < 0.19. In the inset we observe a good correlation between [1/λ ab (0)] 2 and [S/T(T c ) -S/T(2K)] both plotted versus Sr con- tent x, where S(T) is the electronic entropy obtained by integrating the electronic specific heat coefficient γ(T) from 0 to T. The quantity [S/T(T c ) -S/T(2K)] is a measure of the energy-dependent NS electronic density of states (DOS), g n (E), averaged over ±2k B T c around the Fermi energy E F . The effect of an energy -dependent DOS on the London penetration depth λ L or ρ s (0) is not usually considered in standard theory which implic- itly assumes a constant DOS and a parabolic E( k) dis- persion relation. It has been argued elsewhere that ρ s (0) = 4π 2 v x 2 g n (E) /e 2 where the average is over an (anisotropic) energy shell E F ± ∆ 0 . Note that this result agrees with the standard expression for the NS conduc- tivity and the usual relation between λ L (0) and the real part of the frequency-dependent electronic conductivity in the normal and superconducting states σ 1 n (ω) and σ s 1 (ω), respectively. Namely, λ L (0) is determined by the area under the [σ 1 n (ω) − σ 1 s (ω)] curve in the frequency range 0 < hω/2π < 2∆ 0 . Thus the inset to Fig. sug- gests that the strong decrease of ρ s (0) with x from x = 0.20 to 0.10 is related to the suppression of spectral weight with energy range E F ± ∆ 0 due to the presence of ∆ N .","0"
"7","PR06014617-CC","7","The main panel in Fig. shows a correlation be- tween the doping dependence of the initial linear terms of λ ab (T ) and the low-T specific heat coefficient γ, both quantities being related to the number of excited quasi- particles n e (T). For low values of x, n e (T=10) is much smaller than expected from the T c value and this proba- bly implies that the average value of ∆ 0 (φ) is significantly larger than T c . The rapid rise above x = 0.20 may arise from the combined effects of the closure of ∆ N at x = 0.19 , the decreasing T c plus the fact that for LSCO there is significant pile up of states near E F in the over- doped region 0.20 < x < 0.35.","0"
"8","PR06014617-CC","8","In Fig. we present the LSCO acs data as [λ ab (0)/λ ab (T )] 2 versus T/T c and compare the data with the mean-field calculation for a d-wave weak-coupled BCS superconductor with a cylindrical Fermi surface (FS) which gives ∆ 0 /T c ∼ 2.14 . There appears to be a systematic deviation of the data from the weak- coupling T-dependence with a greater (weaker) curvature on the underdoped (overdoped) side. We note however, that particularly in the overdoped samples there is pos- itive curvature near T c which may arise from a small amount of doping inhomogeneity giving a distribution of T c values in this region where dT c /dp is maximal . The effect of this is to rescale the curves with a slightly lower value of T c . We have modelled ρ s (T ) using the d-wave T-dependence and a normal distribution of T c values with standard deviation of 3%, 5% and 9% for x = 0.20, 0.22 and 0.24, respectively. These corrections, plotted in Fig. , bring the curves for x = 0.20 and 0.22 into good agreement with weak-coupling BCS with ∆ 0 /T c ∼ 2.14. Similar deductions, as to the magnitude and p-dependence of ∆ 0 /T c , were made in the specific heat studies on these overdoped samples . However, the x = 0.24 sample still shows significant deviations that possibly reflect changes in the electronic structure. This would not be surprising given the changes in the FS with the rapid crossover from hole-like to electron-like states near x = 0.27 . We note that the data for x = 0.24 is in excellent agreement with a weak-coupling d-wave calculation for a rectangular FS .","0"

"10","PR06014617-CC","10","A central conclusion of the present work is that there is a crossover in both ρ s (0) and ρ s (T ) near p = 0.20. Such behaviour is characteristic of many other NS and superconducting properties which have been interpreted in terms of the presence of ∆ N in the underdoped region. The rate of depression of T c due to impurity scattering (∝ 1/γ at T c ) remains constant across the overdoped region then rises sharply with the opening of ∆ N , be- ginning in the lightly overdoped region at p ∼ 0.19 . Boebinger and coworkers using intense pulsed mag- netic fields observe a crossover from insulating to metallic behaviour at T = 0 occurring near p = 0.18 and angle- resolved photoemission studies show the development, in the overdoped region, of a full NS Fermi surface . In this region the resistivity coefficient, [ρ(T ) − ρ(0)]/T , ex- hibits a low-T suppression due to the opening of ∆ N . These considerations provide a compelling motivation for interpreting our penetration depth data within a similar scenario.","0"

How- ever, a key characteristic of ∆ N is the loss of NS spectral weight near E F . The loss of spectral weight can cause, as discussed above, both a strong reduction in ρ s (0) and, in a simple model, enhanced curvature in ρ s (T )/ρ s (0) above the BCS weak-coupling d-wave T-dependence , the very features we observe for the optimal and underdoped samples.","0"

However, systematic changes in [λ ab (0)/λ ab (T )] 2 with p were noted at the time al- though these were too small to allow further analysis. This may simply be due to the fact that the YBCO sam- ples were not as heavily underdoped as the x = 0.10 LSCO sample. We also note that YBCO is complicated by a mixed s+d order parameter and the effect of the Cu-O chains on the total ρ s .","0"

In the YBa 2 Cu 3 O y (YBCO) system, the hole concentration in the CuO 2 planes is ambiguous because of the exis- tence of the imperfect CuO chains which absorb part of the doped holes.

"19","PR06114956-CC","3","In ordinary metals or semiconductors, the Hall coeffi- cient R H is often used for the determination of the carrier concentration.

More- over, it has been reported for LSCO that the magnitude of R H is several times smaller than that expected from the chemically-determined carrier concentration . On the other hand, it has been proposed that the magni- tude of the thermopower at room temperature (290 K), denoted as S(290K), can be used for the determination of p, based on the observation that the plot of T c /T max c vs S(290K) is almost ""universal"" among many cuprates (T max c is the optimum T c of each system), although the data of the LSCO system do not follow the ""universal"" relation .

An increase in the La concentration z in this system leads to a smaller den- sity of holes in the CuO 2 planes, and the optimum T c is achieved with z ≃ 0.4. In this paper, we report our systematic measurements of S(290K) and R H (T ) for a series of BSLCO single crystals, for which z is varied from 0.2 to 1.0. It is found that the optimally-doped BSLCO crystal show notably smaller S(290K) value than that expected from the ""universal"" relation. This is a strong indication that the ""universal"" relation does not hold in the BSLCO system and thus one should not use this relation to determine p. We therefore tried to use the temperature-dependent R H for the determination of p. We show that, using R H (T ) of the LSCO system as a template, the R H (T ) data can give reasonable estimate of p. With the p values thus obtained, we construct the relation between p and S(290K), which is actually quite different from the ""universal"" relation.

It is clear that the two curves do not agree at all. This is either because the universal relation between p and S(290K) does not hold in the BSLCO system or because the T c values are somehow reduced from the ideal value (and thus does not correctly reflect the hole concentra- tions). To determine which is actually the case, we pay attention to the peaks in Fig. , which corresponds to the optimum doping; if we can find an evidence from another experiment that the optimum T c of BSLCO is in- deed realized at p ≃ 0.16, it is a clear indication that the universal relation of T c /T max c vs S(290K) is disobeyed in BSLCO.

Note that R H e/N V (e is the electronic charge) gives the inverse of the fictitious hole density per Cu. Figure shows the plot of R H e/N V vs T for various cuprates, LSCO, YBCO, Tl-2201, and BSLCO, at optimum dop- ing.

Remember that there is a tendency that ρ 0 be- comes systematically larger with increasing La doping, as shown in Fig. . This suggests that one possi- ble reason for the disappearance of superconductivity at z ≃ 0.9 (which corresponds to p = 0.09 -0.10) is the increased disorder in the heavily-La-doped crystals. In other words, in our BSLCO samples the superconductiv- ity is more significantly suppressed in more underdoped samples because of the larger amount of disorder probed by ρ 0 . The microscopic origin of this disorder triggered by heavy La doping is yet to be elucidated; it is difficult to imagine that the random potential produced by the replacement of Sr with La itself is responsible to produce ρ 0 of as large as 400 µΩcm.","0"

CuO 6 octahedra is very small (or even zero) and the orthorhombicity has been suppressed with pressure. Therefore, the T ot in this case must be less than 77 K for both samples studied. At ambient pressure certain new modes appear at ∼150 cm −1 , ∼280 cm −1 , and ∼370 cm −1 mainly in the superconducting doping region and at low temperatures . These modes have been attributed to IR phonons activated in the Raman spectra from the breaking of the inversion symmetry . At high hydrostatic pressures only traces of the ∼150 cm −1 band can be seen at very low temperatures (Figs. ). On the other hand, the intensity of the other IR mode at ∼370 cm −1 increases considerable in the high pressure low temperature spectra and becomes even stronger than the apical oxygen (Figs. ). Since the mode has an increased width at high pressures and it is mixed with the ∼280 cm −1 broad band, no quantitative conclusions can be drawn for its pressure and temperature dependence. Since the three new bands are related with IR phonons of different symmetry, the data may indicate that the high pressure alters the local symmetry and affects the intermediate phase marked by the appearance of the IR modes, which is formed above T c. It should be mentioned the considerable increase with pressure in the intensity of the B 3g mode at ∼480 cm −1 of the planar oxygen atoms.

For both compounds the low temperature dependence of λ ab was found to be lin- ear as expected for d-wave superconductivity. In fact normalised plots of [λ ab (0) / λ ab (T)] 2 versus T/T c were the same, and like YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO 7 ) 6 agreed very well with mean field (MF) theory for a weak coupling d-wave superconductor. However, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and tunneling data strongly suggest that for underdoped samples the superconducting gap, (∆ 0 ), remains constant, or even in- creases slightly, while T c falls and so large deviations from MF theory might be expected. We have therefore ex- tended our investigation to deoxygenated (underdoped) pure YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ using the same ac susceptibility tech- nique to measure the penetration depth.

We find that the presence of the linear term in λ ab (T) is independent of the number of CuO 2 planes per unit cell, carrier concentration, crystal structure, anisotropy and the presence of chains. Surprisingly our data show good agreement with weak coupling d-wave theory, and the linear term in [λ ab (T) / λ ab (0)] appears to scale with T /T c .

The fully oxygenated, δ = 0.0 (YBCO 7 , T c = 92 K), samples were prepared by annealing bulk pieces in pure oxygen atmo- sphere at 380 o C for 24 hours and then slowly cooling to room temperature. (Hereafter T c represents the temper- ature where the onset of superconductivity occurs in the ac susceptibility data for a measuring field H ac = 3 G rms and frequency f = 333 Hz.)  The δ = 0.3 (YBCO 6.7 , T c = 66 K) sample was prepared by annealing in pure oxygen atmosphere at 650 o C for 12 h and then quench- ing in liquid nitrogen, while the δ = 0.43 (YBCO 6.57 , T c = 56 K) sample was annealed in 0.2% O 2 / N 2 atmo- sphere at 550 o C for 12 hours and also quenched into liq- uid nitrogen. The final oxygen contents were determined from the weight change of a fully oxygenated reference sample. The δ = 0.0 bulk piece was lightly ground and sedimented in acetone to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution. The sedimented powders were then heat treated to repair any structural damages to the surface of the grains. For δ = 0.3 and 0.43 on the other hand a bulk piece for each δ was lightly ground and sieved through a 20 µm sieve in an argon glove box to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution and to avoid surface degradation of the crystallites. The collected powders were then kept in argon atmosphere for 30 min before be- ing aligned. All powders, δ = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.43, were mag- netically aligned in epoxy as described earlier. The average grain diameters corresponding to the 50% cumu- lative volume point were 5 and 10 µm for the fully oxy- genated and the oxygen deficient samples, respectively. The fraction of the unoriented powder in all grain aligned samples was estimated to be < 5 %. Rocking curve anal- ysis of the δ = 0.0 and δ > 0.0 samples gave a full width at half maximum of ± 1.4 and 1 o , respectively. Low field susceptibility, χ, measurements were performed us- ing commercial equipment (down to 4.2 K) for samples with δ = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.43. The sample with δ = 0.43 was also measured down to 1.2 K using a home built suscep- tometer. Details of the experimental technique and the application of London's model for deriving λ from the measured χ in cuprate superconductors can be found in earlier publications. The values of λ ab (0) derived from our data are 0.14, 0.21 and 0.28 µm and the corresponding values for λ c (0) are 1.26, 4.53 and 7.17 µm for δ = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.43, respectively. The errors in λ ab (0) arising from a pos- sible uncertainty of ± 5% in the alignment can be as high as ± 25%, whereas those in λ c (0) are ± 8%. How- ever, the corresponding uncertainty in the linear term in [λ ab (T)/λ ab (0)] is much less, at most ± 10%. The present results differ from previous work in which the surfaces of the particles were probably not as clean and the degree of grain alignment was probably lower. As T c is reduced by lowering the carrier concentration (for δ = 0.3 and 0.43), [1 / λ ab 2 (0)] falls, a behaviour which has been ex- tensively discussed in terms of the Uemura relation.

It is clear that the linear term in 1-[λ ab (0) / λ ab (T )] 2 increases as T c decreases. If we use the standard BCS result for λ(T ) of a d-wave superconductor, 28 to fit the experimental data shown in Fig. (at T / T c < 0.25) we find that ∆ 0 scales approximately with T c [Fig. (inset)], giving ∆ 0 ≈ 2T c , a value close to that ex- pected for weak-coupling superconductivity. For com- parison we also include data for the s-wave perovskite Ba 0.6 K 0.4 BiO 3 (BKBO). The compounds Bi-2212 and Tl-2201 25 would also give ∆ 0 ≈ 2T c on this plot. The maximum error in the linear terms i.e. the values of ∆ 0 in Fig. (inset), is ± 20 %. The scaling of ∆ 0 with T c , Fig. (inset), is in agreement with early tunneling spectroscopy data for several cuprates as a function of carrier concentration, ranging from the underdoped to the optimally doped regimes. It is not consistent however, with more recent tunneling 8 and ARPES 7 results for underdoped cuprates where ∆ 0 was actually found to increase slightly while T c falls. There seems to be two possible ways of ac- counting this discrepancy. One is that the recent spectro- scopic experiments actually measure the normal state gap. In this scenario the effect of the normal state gap would be to leave small pockets of holes whose supercon- ducting properties are still described reasonably well by MF theory. The other is similar to a recent phenomeno- logical approach. As shown in Fig. , it is probable, that within experimental error, the unnormalised plots of [1/λ ab (T ) 2 ], i.e. n s (T), versus T at low temperatures are parallel for samples with different T c values. This would correspond to the same number of excited quasiparticles, [n s (0) -n s (T)], at a given temperature for all T c values- as implied by specific heat work on underdoped YBCO. Such parallel shifts give [n s (0) -n s (T)] = aT, where a is independent of doping level (T c ). In combination with the well-known Uemura relation n s (0) ∝ T c , this gives [1-n s (T) /n s (0)] = b T /T c , where b is independent of T c. So at low T, [λ ab (0) / λ ab (T )] 2 versus T/T c would still scale on to a single curve even when the MF relation ∆ 0 / T c ≈ 2, is strongly violated.","0"

It is widely accepted that the in-plane response of the cuprates is in the clean-limit and the strong mid-infrared response is due to strong correlation effects in the cuprates. In particular the marginal Fermi-liquid (MFL) , and Lut- tinger liquid approaches along with the conventional strong electron-phonon interaction have been put forward to account for these unusual properties. In these models the strong mid-infrared conductivity is related to the linear frequency dependence of the scattering rate of the quasi-particles in a single band picture.

The temperature dependence of the low-frequency conductivity is consistent with the dc resistivity measured on crystals of the same batch. Based on the f-sum rule we argue that phonon-contributions are too weak to account for this maximum. We discuss a scenario, where the unusual temperature dependence is due to intra-and interband transitions within and between electronic bands near E F of CuO 2 and BiO character. Bi 2 Sr 2 Cu0 6 single crystals were grown from a precursor dissolved in liquid KCl. Due to the formation of an enclosed cavity of a few cm 3 within the melt samples were obtained as free standing crystalline platelets of sizes up to 1-2×1-2 mm 2 and of thickness 5-20 µm. A constant cavity temperature of 840-850 • C and a constant temperature gradient (2-3 K/cm) were kept within the melt in order to provide permanent transport of the precursor to the growth zone, which is important for a free growth of homogeneous crystals with a flat mirror surface. Such samples require no mechanical or chemical polishing prior to the infrared reflectivity measurements. X-ray measurements revealed a perfect crystal structure with lattice parameters a = 5.36Å b =5.37Å and c = 24.64Å, which correspond to the orthorhombic √ 2 × √ 2 distortion of the body centered tetragonal structure. No traces of other phases could be detected. The rocking curves have a full width at half maximum of 0.1 • , 7 which is the minimum value so far reported. Both from the resistivity and the ac- susceptibility we obtained the same values for the superconducting transition temperature (T c =7-8 K) and for the transition width (∆T c =2 K). Unlike earlier reports where a linear resistivity was observed down to the superconducting phase transition , in the present crystals ρ(T ) is only linear at high temperatures but saturates below 40 K 10 at a residual resistivity with a sample to sample variation from 150 to 300 µΩcm.","1"

"74","PR05514152-CC","11","The maximum near 500 cm −1 (indicated with arrows in Fig. ) shifts to a lower frequency upon reducing the temperature, and is superimposed on a steeply falling free-electron con- ductivity which increases as the temperature is decreased. At 10 K the free-electron response is prevalent in the low frequency conductivity. In the remainder of this paper we will in- dicate the depression of the conductivity below the maximum as a pseudo-gap. In the present case there is no unambiguous -and physically meaningful-way to decompose the conductivity in free-carrier and bound-charge components. One of the reasons is, that in the high T c cuprates also the intraband conductivity deviates considerably from standard Drude behavior. In particular the high T c cuprates, if optimally doped, are known to have a linear frequency dependency of the scattering rate, as follows from inversion of the real and imaginary part of σ(ω) using the expression 14 σ(ω) = ne 2 m −1 / {γ(ω) − iωm ⋆ (ω)/m}, where n is the carrier density, m is the band mass, m ⋆ (ω)/m is the effective mass enhancement, and 1/γ(ω) is the effective relaxation time. A further complication arises, if two or more electronic bands cross the Fermi level. In this case, which we believe to be relevant for Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6 , the spectrum of σ(ω) contains interband transitions in addition to the intra- band components. The interband part has a complex line-shape which depends on the details of the band-dispersion and the k-dependent optical transition matrix elements. Obviously if the material has two or more bands of electrons, at least one of which (the CuO 2 bands) has a frequency dependent scattering rate, it is no longer possible to make a meaningful sepa- ration in several components. At low temperatures, where the CuO 2 channel has a reduced scattering rate, σ(ω) is dominated by the CuO 2 channel at least at the low frequencies. In this region one might hope to extract the frequency dependent scattering rate of the CuO 2 carriers, at least up to a frequency where other contributions to σ(ω) become significant. For this reason we display in the inset of Fig. the frequency dependent scattering rate only for the lowest temperature. We notice that the linear behavior of γ(ω), which is rather typical for all high T c cuprates, exists only up to 0.1 eV in this case. In view of the possibility of low energy interband transitions in this compound, even at 10 K γ(ω) extracted from optical data is probably no longer meaningful forhω > 0.1 eV. Our observations support the conclusion by Romero et al, based on an analysis of infrared transmission data, that the linear frequency dependency of γ(ω) is limited to the energy range below 0.1 eV. The non-linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in the crystals used for this study is also inconsistent with MFL behavior at the lowest temperatures.","0"

The LAPW band calculations of Singh and Pickett 2 give two types of bands: For a vanishing orthorhombic distortion there is a large Cu-O derived barrel section centered at X and its √ 2 × √ 2 folded counterpart centered around Γ. In addition there are two Bi-O derived electron pockets with their BZ-folded counter parts, all of them centered at M . As suggested by Singh and Pickett, 2 a weak structural change from tetragonal to orthorhombic strongly affects the structure of the electronic bands. The bands are shifted up to 400 meV for Bi displacements of 0.14Å and 0.41Å for O. As a result 5 bands were calculated for k close to the saddle point (M), all within a range of 200 meV around E F . Only two of the Bi-O pockets (one of them barely) cross E F when the orthorhombic distortions are taken into account. Because the band structure is strongly affected by modulations of the lattice, it can also have an appreciable temperature dependence. Photoemission studies have revealed a single occupied band near E F close to the M -point, which was originally indicated as a possible BiO derived band but was identified as a CuO 2 band in a later publication . The absence of a clear BiO-derived band in photoemission may however result from a disorder induced smearing of the k-dispersion in the BiO-layers, or from the small photoelectron cross section for Bi and O states compared to the Cu 3d cross-section.","0"

The pseudo-gap at high temperatures would be due to transitions between the closely spaced bands which cross E F near M . In this scenario the disappearance of the pseudo-gap at low temperatures can reflect a gradual change of atomic coordinates upon cooling, with a corresponding change of the interband separation. This structural modulation can easily result in a re-distribution of carriers between BiO and CuO 2 bands and the disappearance of the pseudo-gap. Interestingly, large lattice distortions are generally present in films, which show a higher T c and a more pronounced pseudo-gap. We have presented experimental data on the in-plane infrared response of superconduct- ing Bi2201 single crystals for temperatures from 10 K to 300 K. The optical conductivity shows a pseudo-gap feature, that shifts with temperature. The optical conductivity is at least one order of magnitude too large to be compatible with a purely phononic interpre- tation of this feature.

Unresolved issues remain concern- ing the normal-state temperature dependence and the superconducting-state enhancement. Because of the low carrier density, heat conduction by the lattice accounts for more than half of the measured normal-state κ ab in these materials. One would expect κ ab (T ) in high-quality crystals to reflect a dominant lattice contribution simi- lar to that of crystalline insulators, i.e. κ ab ∼ 1/T at high-T , rising sharply to a maximum at low T . This be- havior is observed in Nd 2−x Ce x CuO 4 (Nd-214), but for all other cuprates investigated κ ab is very weakly T de- pendent for T > T c . Whereas for Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCuO 8 struc- tural disorder (e.g., the Bi-O layer modulation ) might explain its nearly glass-like lattice contribution, this would not seem applicable to YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+x (Y-123) and La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (La-214). Furthermore, κ ab (T ) for un- doped, insulating Y-123 and La-214 is unconventional, suggesting that the weak T -dependence of κ ab is generic to the latter materials and not directly related to the presence of free charge. An unidentified phonon damping mechanism appears to underlie this behavior, possibly due to local lattice distortions and/or mag- netic excitations. Regarding the enhancement, 4,7 ther- mal Hall conductivity experiments 8 on optimally-doped Y-123 imply that the phenomenon is largely electronic in origin, but less is known about underdoped compounds. The magnitude of the enhancement correlates with the superconducting pair density 9,10 in Y-123 throughout the underdoped regime, and it is of interest to explore the generality of this behavior through studies of other cuprates.","0"

We find that the magnitude of κ a (transverse to the chains) at T =300K is comparable to that of Y-123, but κ b is 3- 4 times larger.

The steady-state thermal conductivity measurements employed a fine-wire differential chromel-constantan thermocouple and minia- ture chip resistor as heater, both glued to the specimen with varnish or epoxy. The absolute accuracy of the mea- surements is ±20% due to uncertainty in the placement of the thermocouple junctions.

Also of interest is the anisotropy: Γ a /Γ b ≈ 1.5 for specimen 259. Evidently this anisotropy is responsible for the decrease in κ b /κ a at T ≤ T c (Fig. ).

Although great effort has been devoted to the accurate measurement of λ c , the exper- imental results are still controversial. For example, for optimally doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 , optical and surface impedance measurements found λ c (T = 0K) ≃ 4µm, in agreement with the prediction of ILT theory. On the other hand for Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+x , vortex imaging and optical measurements yielded λ c (0) ≃ 19µm, and more recent optical measurements gave 12µm . These high values of λ c (0) cannot be easily accounted by the ILT model . Furthermore, for nearly opti- mally doped HgBa 2 CuO 4+x (T c = 96K), the values of λ c (0) obtained by vortex imaging and optical measurements are ≃ 8µm and 6µm, respectively. How- ever, ac-susceptibility measurements for slightly over- doped HgBa 2 CuO 4+x (T c =93K) give λ c (0) ≃ 1.5µm in agreement with ILT theory. The large discrepancies in the reported values of λ c (0) for HTS with one CuO 2 plane per unit cell makes it difficult to reach a consensus regarding the trends of λ c (0) in HTS and also the validity of the ILT model .

Transport, magnetic and spectroscopic measurements confirmed the high quality of our samples. The data were analysed using London's model for small aligned crystallites of anisotropic HTS.

The low-field ac-susceptibility technique gives the fractional diamagnetism of a superconductor and thus is a direct probe of the magnetic penetration depth . For each doping concentration of LSCO, the result presented here is typical of those obtained for four samples prepared in- dependently from the same polycrystalline pellet. Each of these samples was aligned at different times and from each sample 4 pieces were cut and measured. Therefore a total of 16 samples were investigated for each doping content. In the case of Hg-1201, two samples were pre- pared from the same polycrystalline pellet and again 4 pieces of each aligned sample were cut and measured for each doping level. The error of λ c (0) is estimated to be < 8% for LSCO and < 10% for Hg-1201, while the error in the relative temperature dependence λ c (T )/λ c (0) is < 1% and is therefore negligible.","1"

Although the values of Kirtley et al. and Basov et al. correspond to samples with high values of T c (96K) the results shown here strongly suggest that their values of λ c (0) correspond to significantly lower doping levels where the normal state gap comes into play. In this sense our results support the ILT model-since the only clear exception to this model is now the Tl-2201 compound . However, we should note that for any pairing mechanism (not just ILT) the presence of the normal state gap also leads to a similar correlation be- tween the condensation energy, and the superfluid den- sity, i.e., λ c (0) and λ ab (0) . There are also dis- tinct differences between λ c and λ ab . The anisotropy γ increases on the underdoped side and the T -dependences at low temperatures (at T < 0.3T c ) are very different. Namely, the in-plane component varies always linearly with T whereas the c-axis counterpart varies as T n with n ≃ 3 for LSCO [this work] and n ≃ 5 for Hg-1201 . Details on possible mechanisms leading to these power laws can be found in ref. .

Thus, it is important to understand whether a nonmagnetic impurity can induce a local mo- ment on the surrounding Cu 2+ sites. Early theoreti- cal treatment of the problem expected that a nonmag- netic impurity can only induce a local moment when the ""mother"" phase has a spin gap . Further studies of this problem concluded that in a doped antiferromag- net with no spin gap an induced localized magnetization will exist around the impurity but it does not correspond to a free moment. At low enough temperatures where the staggered correlation length is larger than the local- ization length associated with the impurity distortion, this localized moment is always aligned with the local staggered order . While the question of whether the magnetic moments exist in a global sense and in par- ticular whether the moments are observable below the superconducting transition temperature is still an open question, new theoretical ideas argue that the moments may be partially screened below the spin gap and fully screened deep in the superconducting state in the cuprates. Recently, there has been some theoretical work done considering the fact of a possible Kondo-screening. In a conventional s-wave superconductor, the Kondo ef- fect is suppressed by the formation of the superconduct- ing gap, as shown by Abrikosov and Gorkov . In d- wave superconductors, however, there are quasiparticles in the node lines which could cause a Kondo screening. Indeed, Fradkin and Cassanello recently calculated the thermodynamic properties of a d-wave superconductors with magnetic impurities . They predicted a screen- ing mechanism analogous to the exchange coupling be- tween magnetic impurities and the electrons in a Fermi liquid that causes the Kondo effect. In the clean limit, the Dirac like quasiparticles and the magnetic impurity form a singlet state. The screening is only effective above a critical exchange coupling , because in contrast to the Kondo effect in metals, the density of states of normal quasiparticles in a d-wave superconductor vanishes at the Fermi surface. In this limit, the magnetic susceptibilty disappears superlinearly, hence the effect can be consid- ered as overscreening.","0"

In the present paper we provide a comprehensive study of the effect of Zn impurities on the behavior of low-lying electronic excitations in YBCO. To this end we study the specific heat of pure, 0.15%, 0.31% and 1% Zn-doped single crystals YBCO samples. We extend earlier mea- surements on Zn-doped polycrystalline YBCO samples. Compared to pure YBCO we find that: i) The linear-T term, which has been regularly observed in specific heat measurements of YBCO is greatly increased. This result is only qualitatively consistent with the ""dirty d- wave"" scenario used to explain the penetration depth measurements and the suppression of T c . ii) The T 3 term decreases, suggesting either a surprisingly large increase in the Debye temperature or a new electronic contribution with a similar temperature dependence. iii) A low temperature upturn T −2 below ∼3.5 K is observed. This upturn is seen in many specific heat measurements , though , its origin is still unclear. iv) The most intriguing result of our measurements is that there is no apparent increase in the number of free magnetic mo- ments as indicated by a Schottky anomaly in any of the Zn-doped samples as compared with the pure sample. Normal state measurements of the magnetization of the 1% sample is in agreement with previous measurements indicating a magnetic moment of the size ∼0.36 µ B /Zn.

Devi- ations from this γT + βT 3 behavior are not very notice- able for the nominally pure sample, but with increasing Zn concentration the samples show a low-temperature upturn below ∼3 K. Also, from a visual observation, the curves for the Zn-doped samples have larger γ, and smaller β suggesting higher electronic density of states and higher Debye temperatures with increasing Zn con- centration. While the cause of the low-temperature up- turn is still unknown, there are some indications that it is related to interaction between paramagnetic impurities and a local field or a result of collective behavior of these impurities . This is supported by our finding that this upturn is somewhat influenced by the quality of the sample. Previous reports of early samples of YBCO, showed a much larger low-temperature upturn in the spe- cific heat, thus, a straightforward fitting of the data at higher temperatures (e.g. ≥ 5 K) to avoid the upturn will result in misleading values of both the γT term and the βT 3 term .

Based on our previous results on pure YBCO crystals we first attempt the general fit: where we omitted the T 2 term for the Zn doped samples as we no longer expect to have clean lines of nodes, and we attempt to account for the uncertainty in the upturn by allowing the power law used to describe it to vary as T −N where N=1,2.

The zero-field linear-T term increases from 3.0 mJ/mol-K 2 in the nominally pure sample to 4.3, 5.8 and 11.7 mJ/mol- K 2 in the 0.15%, 0.31% and 1% Zn doped samples re- spectively. Assuming a normal state linear T coefficient γ n ∼20 mJ/mol-K 2 , this implies a residual density of states ratios n res = N (E F )/N n of 0.066, 0.14, and 0.43 for the three crystals (here N (E F ) is the density of states at the Fermi level and N n is the density of states in the normal state that results in that γ n ). From penetration depth measurements of crystals from the same batches , an analysis based on a ""dirty d-wave"" found a scattering parameter Γ/T c ≃ 0.018-0.030 for 0.31% Zn doping and Γ/T c ≃ 0.006-0.009 for the 0.15% Zn dop- ing. In the limit of strong resonant scattering the dirty d-wave model predicts Γ ∝ n 2 res with a logarithmic cor- rection of order ln(T c n res /Γ) . Ref. shows reasonable agreement with that prediction using penetration depth data of 0.15% and 0.31%. To analyze the specific heat we first need to estimate the ""Zn-like"" impurities in the nominally pure sample. Again, the penetration depth of similar samples give a scattering parameter Γ/T c of about 0.0008 which corresponds to an impurity concen- tration of 0.013% and a residual density of states ratio of 0.03, which implies a contribution of ∼0.6 mJ/mol-K 2 to the zero-field linear term. The residual ∼2.4 mJ/mol-K 2 most probably come from the unfilled chains as was found by measuring the high oxygen content crystals . Us- ing the above data figure shows the change of the zero field linear term from the Zn-free sample ( ∆γ(0) ) as a function of the Zn concentration. For comparison we also show in figure the expected ∆γ(0) expected from ""dirty d-wave"" theory . While as for the penetration depth data, the low Zn concentration fits the ""dirty d- wave"" theory reasonably well, stronger deviation appears for the 1% sample indicating a more linear dependence on the Zn concentration. Table summarizes the results presented above.","0"
"121","PR06103604-CC","10","For pure samples, the field dependent coefficient of the linear-T term obeys γ(H) = γ(0) +γ(H). Whileγ ∝ H 1/2 for pure samples, Zn doping alters this behavior and the 1% Zn sample showedγ ∝ H as is shown in figure . This suppression of the H 1/2 term was expected because of increased scattering. In Volovik's work , the H 1/2 magnetic field dependence of the density of states results from the use of the intervortex spacing as a cutoff to the spatial integral over the density of states in the vortex. For the large Zn concentration such as our 1% sample we expect a much shorter cutoff length. In the unitary limit the scattering rate at low frequencies (and temperatures) saturates at a value ℓ ∼ v F n res /2Γ . Using our results for Γ we find that this length is of order 100Å, thus explaining the linear field dependence.","0"
"122","PR06103604-CC","11","Finally we turn to the search of the Zn induced mag- netic moments. As noted in the introduction the Zn- induced impurities are expected to be observed in finite magnetic field specific heat measurements. For a two- level system this is a Schottky-like anomaly given by: where ∆ is the size of the two-level system gap. Clearly a true two level system exists for spin 1/2 impurities only. In the case of Zn impurities we expect an effective mo- ment of order one Bohr-magneton , hence, a simplified two-level system with a moment µ and a gap ∆ = 2µH should be a good approximation for the expected efect on the specific heat. Also in equation 2, ν Sch is the mo- lar concentration of moments and R is the gas constant. Impurity moments are always found in specific heat mea- surements of high-T c materials even for ""pure"" crystals. For optimally doped YBCO a concentration of about 0.05% -0.1% per copper atom is found . For higher oxygen concentration this number is smaller providing us with evidence that most of these moments come from un- compensated copper atoms in the chains. As mentioned above, it has been argued that Zn impurities induce mo- ments that for the concentration range and oxygen level of our samples is expected to be µ = 0.32µ B to 0.36µ B . Thus, it is easy to calculate the expected Schottky anomaly associated with the Zn moments; in particular we expect that since the Zn moments originate from the Cu-O planes and the ""unaccounted"" spin-1/2 moments come from the chains the Zn contribution will simply be an addition to the pure crystal heat capacity. With the above introduction, the most surprising result is that we did not find any change in the Schottky anomaly for any of the Zn doping all the way to 8 Tesla, the maxi- mum field we measured. This result can most dramat- ically be seen in figure where the specific heat data at 8 Tesla is plotted together with the calculated Schot- tky anomaly expected for 1% Zn with magnetic moment per Zn of µ = 0.32µ B (the smaller expected contribu- tion). Also plotted in figure is a Schottky anomaly with µ = 1.28µ B , displaying the possibility of a ""composite"" moment that results from local ferromagnetic interaction of moments on four neighboring oxygen atoms . If a significant amount of either 0.32µ B or 1.28µ B moments were present, it would be readily apparent in the size of the Schottky anomaly, which is unchanged from undoped samples. Fitting with a Schottky term with 1.28µ B mo- ments in addition to the 1µ B -spin-1/2 anomaly finds no more than 0.02% additional spins per Cu and is con- sistent with no 1.28µ B moments at all. At 0.32µ B per moment, the presence of 1% spins per Cu would create a Schottky tail which wouldn't roll over at even the high- est fields and lowest temperatures measured. However, this upturn would increase proportionally to the square of the applied field, being 16 times larger at 8 Tesla than at 2 Tesla. Assuming that all of the low temperature up- turn in the 8 Tesla data is from a small-moment Schottky anomaly, we obtain an upper limit of 0.03% spins per Cu, for 0.32µ B moment spins. Figure highlights this dis- crepancy, showing that even with different fitting meth- ods, there are few, if any, of the Zn impurities creating free magnetic moments in the crystal.","0"
"123","PR06103604-CC","12","The absence of Zn-induced magnetic moments in the superconducting state may be explained in two ways. The first is that the moments exist only in a local sense and thus will be found in local measurements such as Knight shift but will be missed in bulk measurements such as the present specific heat due to the ""spread"" of the moment throughout the whole sample . To check for this hypothesis we measured the susceptibility of the 1%-Zn doped sample. A weak Curie behavior was found which is of similar magnitude to that measured by Zagoulaev et al. implying a similar size of magnetic moment per Zn impurity. The fact that the Zn-moments exist in the normal state may be explained by the fact that we have been measuring a doped Heisenberg antifer- romagnet which is close to optimal doping, and for which the spin gap has not collapsed yet.","0"
"124","PR06103604-CC","13","The second possibility for the ""disappearance"" of the moments is that they are screened in a Kondo fashion. Such a possibility was recently considered by Nagaosa and Lee and by Cassanello and Fradkin . Rele- vant to our measurements is the Cassanello and Fradkin work in which they postulated that magnetic impurities in a clean d-wave superconductor will be screened, and show that the screening can be described as a multichan- nel non-marginal Kondo problem. For simplicity they as- sume spin-1/2 impurities that are located on the Cu sites in the planes. Using expected values of the exchange cou- pling, they find a critical temperature T K ∼ 10 K, below which the impurities will be overscreened. Their calcu- lation of the low-temperature specific heat yielded the expressions: Here ν i is the impurity concentration per mole, R is the universal gas constant, ζ(3) is the Rieman zeta function of argument 3, N c is the rank of the symmetry group of the impurity spin, taken to be 2 in the relevant case (see for details), δ is a dimensionless parameter related to the strength of the screening ( the singlet amplitude), ∆ 0 is the maximum gap of the d x 2 −y 2 superconductor, and T K is the Kondo temperature associated with the impurities. Before presenting our fit to the Cassanello and Fradkin's calculation we note that the calculation are based on a very simple model that assumes that the quasiparticles that screen the moments come from the nodes only. However, Zn impurities cause the depression of the order parameter close to the impurity site due to potential scattering (i.e. pair breaking). This effect is the main cause of the depression of T c , and was not included in the calculations. However, all the effects related to Zn scattering are local in nature and thus should reduce to a generalized Andreev boundary condition (general- ized because of the different symmetries that may be in- volved, including inter-node scattering and so on). It is very unlikely that these effects will help in the Kondo screening since these potentials are invariant under spin rotations . With the above discussion in mind we fitted our Zn-doped specific heat data with the screen- ing model, i.e. equations 3. Since the model provides us with the limiting cases only for temperature and fields we first fit the high field, assuming that all the field depen- dence comes from the screening. We then introduce an interpolation function that is exponential in nature which connects the low and high magnetic fields. We show the results of the fit in figure while the fitting parameters are shown in TABLE . Again, compared with Zn-free sample the Schottky anomaly does not change, the T 3 contribution is smaller and a small low temperature up- turn is observed. For the 1%Zn we find (δ/T K )= 0.0082, a value within the range discussed in . For that sam- ple we also find that the quality of the fit degrades at high fields, possibly due to the model becoming invalid with the relatively large DOS at the nodes and its si- multaneous smearing by the Zn doping and the magnetic field. For the 0.31%Zn the value (δ/T K )= 0.003 seems somewhat low as we expected to first approximation that the two values will be the same.","0"
"125","PR06103604-CC","14","In conclusion, we presented in this paper a comprehen- sive study of the low temperature heat capacity of Zn- doped YBCO single crystals. Several trends have been found as a function of Zn doping. The T 3 term decreases with increasing Zn while the liner term increasing, in- dicating an increasing DOS at the nodes. This residual density of states is only qualitatively consistent with a d-wave resonant scattering theory. The 1%Zn clearly de- viates from the theoretical expectation, showing excess DOS. A low temperature upturn is consistently observed for the Zn-doped samples, similar to early measurements on more disordered YBCO samples. The cause and exact form of this upturn is still not clear. The most surprising result of our study tough is that no Schottky anomaly is observed for the presumed magnetic moments created by Zn doping. Based on a recent theory by Cassanello and Fradkin we fitted the data with Kondo screened mo- ments. The relatively good quality of the fit and the rea- sonable parameters extracted from it give us confidence that indeed Zn-moments in YBCO crystals are screened by quasiparticles in the nodes of the d x 2 −y 2 superconduc- tor.","0"

"139","PR06013094-CC","2","In the cuprate high-temperature superconductors (HTS), the canonical change in T c with pressure is that it first increases, passes through a maximum value at some critical pressure, and then decreases. It has been ar- gued that there are at least two effects determining the total pressure dependence of T c , an intrinsic effect and the one that arises from the pressure-induced changes in the charge carrier concentration. However, there are ef- fects which make the discrimination between these contri- butions difficult. In most HTS the application of pressure doesn't simply compress the lattice, but also prompts mobile oxygen defects to assume a greater degree of lo- cal order. This leads to relaxation effects which are both temperature and pressure dependent. An exception is the double-chain compound YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 with a fixed oxygen stoichiometry. Bucher et al. found that in this com- pound T c increases under hydrostatic pressure with the rate dT c /dp ≃ 5.5 K/GPa. Subsequent studies revealed that with increasing pressure T c passes through a maxi- mum around 9 GPa and then decreases. Furthermore, measurements of the in-plane penetration depth λ ab of YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 revealed pressure induced changes which cannot be simply attributed to the pressure changes of T c . Since in cuprate high-temperature superconduc- tors, including YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 , the critical regime where thermal critical fluctuations dominate is experimentally accessible, various critical properties are not independent but related by universal realtions. Ac- cordingly, the isotope or pressure effects on these quanti- ties are related as well. Here we explore the universal relationship between the pressure effects on transition temperature T c , volume V and anisotropy γ emerging from the pressure induced changes of the magnetization near T c . It is shown that in the underdoped YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 the pressure effect on T c mirrors essentially that on the anisotropy.

Furthermore, from Fig. , showing ∆T c /T c and ∆γ/γ versus p for the estimates listed in Table , it is seen that in the pressure range considered here, both ∆T c /T c and ∆γ/γ depend nearly linearly on pressure. Thus, under pressure not only T c and the volume changes but the anisotropy is modified as well. A quick glance to Table I reveal that the pressure effect on T c mirrors essentially that on the anisotropy. In addition, recent in-plane penetration depth λ ab mea- surements revealed that there is a pressure effect on this important property also. It was shown that the in-plane penetration depth data of YBa 2 Cu 2 O 8 is consistent with 3D-XY critical behavior, where the penetration depth and correlation length in direction i diverge near T c as λ 2 i (T ) = λ 2 i0 t −ν and ξ i (T ) = ξ i0 t −ν with t = 1 − T /T c and ν ≃ 2/3.

The consistency with 3D-XY critical behavior implies that the transition temperature T c and the critical amplitudes of the in-plane penetration depths λ ab0 and the c-axis correlation lengths ξ c0 are not independent but related by Universality implies that this relation holds irrespective of the applied pressure. Thus, in addition to Eq.(6) the pressure induced relative changes are then related by and, because of γ = ξ ab0 /ξ c0 , Using then the estimates for ∆T c /T c and −2∆λ ab0 /λ ab0 the relative change ∆ξ c0 /ξ c0 is readily calculated with aid of Eq. , while the values for ∆ξ ab0 /ξ ab0 follow from relation .

This is consis- tent with the generic behavior for high-temperature su- perconductors, where for a given HTS family T c increases with reduced aniostropy. Although these changes are small compared to those in the critical amplitudes of the in-plane penetration depth ∆λ abo /λ abo and the correlation lengths ∆ξ ab0 /ξ ab0 , ∆ξ c0 /ξ c0 (see Table ) it becomes clear that the pressure induced change of the anisotropy is the essential ingredient which remains to be understood microscopically. Empirically the anisotropy decreases rather steeply by approaching optimum doping and levels off in the overdoped regime. Together with Eq.(6) this explains why the pressure effect on T c becomes very small in optimally and overdoped cuprate superconductors.

By applying P ≤ 3 GPa, the maximum value of ρ c (T ) just above T c is drastically reduced, though T c changes weakly. On the other hand, by applying P ≥ 3 GPa the maximum value of ρ c (T ) is almost constant though T c is strongly suppressed.

It is empirically known that the Fluorinert mixture is jelled by applying P ≥ 1 GPa at around 300K. The jelled mixture, which has a much larger compressibility than the sample, acts as a cushion. Hence, quasi-hydrostatic conditions would be achieved if the sample were embedded in a large vol- ume of mixture. However, a deviation from hydrostatic P is likely caused by the strongly anisotropic distribu- tion of the jelled mixture, though the displacement of six anvil-tops was isotropic. In the P cell, the c axis of the plate sample was arranged parallel to the cylindrical axis of the cell. Comparing the sample size with the inner di- ameter of the cell, we can see that the clearance between the inner wall of the cell and the sample is much narrower than the space along the c-axis direction. Pressure trans- mission is strongly anisotropic because the jelled mixture shows poor fluidity and the cell geometry is anisotropic. In the plate sample measurement, the in-plane compres- sion must be much stronger than the interlayer one; thus, the c-axis stretch is caused by a large contribution from Poisson's ratio.","0"

In a fixed temperature experiment, this is evidenced by the onset of resistiv- ity due to vortex motion well below the magnetic field at which the normal-state resistivity is restored, defined as the resistively-determined upper critical magnetic field, H ρ c2 (T ). Resistivity measurements on overdoped Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO y (Tl-2201) and overdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO y (Bi-2201) have found a strong upward curvature in H ρ c2 (T ) with no evidence of saturation at low temper- atures. Such an H ρ c2 (T ) curve contrasts strongly with the conventional Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory for superconductors with weak electron-phonon coupling , in which H c2 (T ) exhibits negative curvature and saturates at low temperatures. Similarly anoma- lous H ρ c2 (T ) curves have been discussed in connection with other anisotropic superconductors, such as the or- ganic superconductors . However, due to the extremely large upper critical fields, studies of the resistive transi- tion in the cuprates have been largely limited to samples in which T c and H c2 are greatly suppressed , either in strongly underdoped or overdoped samples , in deliberately impurity-doped samples , or in the electron-doped cuprates.","0"
"189","PR06012475-CC","3","In addition to the unusual 'shape' of the H ρ c2 (T ) curves, a re-examination of the origin and meaning of the re- sistive transition in the cuprates is fueled, in part, by specific heat , Raman spectroscopy and magneti- zation measurements which indicate that the onset of local superconducting order [generally interpreted as the mean-field H c2 (T )] in Tl-2201 occurs at magnetic fields well above H ρ c2 (T ). At this mean-field H c2 (T ), no feature is observed in the measured resistivity. Perhaps more surprisingly, the experimental evidence for this mean- field H c2 (T ), in both the specific heat and Raman ex- periments, is anomalously and dramatically suppressed by magnetic fields of only a few tesla. Thus, H ρ c2 (T ) does not seem to correspond to the mean-field H c2 (T ), which might suggest that it corresponds to the melting of the vortex lattice. The difficulty with this interpreta- tion of H ρ c2 (T ) is that it is unclear why the melted vortex state should be (or can be) indistinguishable in resistivity measurements from the normal state. More specifically, if H ρ c2 (T ) corresponds to the irreversibility line, then the magnetic phase diagram (at least for Tl-2201 and Bi- 2201) contains an unusual vortex liquid state whose resis- tivity apparently equals the normal-state resistivity and exhibits no substantial magnetic-field or temperature de- pendence . In light of the debate about the magnetic phase diagram and the interpretation of H ρ c2 (T ) in the cuprates, a systematic study of H ρ c2 (T ), particularly in optimally-doped compounds, is clearly desirable.","0"

It has been repeatedly pointed out that the antiferromagnetic (AF) spin correlation in the CuO 2 planes may play a fundamental role in the normal-state properties and the superconductivity. Recently, there appeared several experiments which show AF correlation is likely to be fundamentally relevant to the high-T c superconductiv- ity. For example, incommensurate spatial modulation of AF fluctuation has been reported in superconduct- ing La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) and in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (YBCO) , and the incommensurability is found to be closely related to T c.","0"
"243","PR05903948-CC","3","The AF correlation in the CuO 2 planes can be dis- turbed by partially replacing Cu with other atoms. It is known that partial substitution of Cu (which has spin 1/2) with Zn (which is nonmagnetic) destroys local AF correlation and thereby quite drastically suppresses su- perconductivity . On the other hand, the effect of Zn substitution on the normal-state charge transport has been believed to be rather modest; it is reported that Zn- substitution simply adds some residual scattering and leaves the signature of the pseudogap in transport properties unchanged . Therefore, it would be interest- ing to look for some fundamental change in the normal- state charge transport caused by the destruction of the local AF correlation upon Zn-doping. This becomes par- ticularly intriguing in the light of the recently observed logarithmic divergence of the normal-state resistivity in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) , in which system presence of a dynamical charge stripe order is discussed . The charge stripes intervene in the antiferromagnetically cor- related domains, so that the stripes are one-dimensional (1D) defects to the AF correlation; similarly, Zn is a point-like defect to the AF correlation. If the charge stripe in the LSCO system is the source of the unusual increase in resistivity at low temperatures as recently pro- posed , then Zn-doping might also induce similar un- usual localization behavior at low temperatures, although the dimensionality of the defect is different.","0"

We found that the Zn substitution induces unusual carrier localization at low temperatures in a ""clean"" sys- tem with k F l > 5, where l is the mean free path and k F is the Fermi wave number. This observation strongly suggests that the local destruction of the AF correlation by Zn-doping can severely and qualitatively affect the charge transport in cuprates; therefore, the AF correla- tion in the CuO 2 plane seems to be indispensable to the peculiar metallic normal-state charge transport. There are two different Cu sites in YBCO, the chain site Cu(1) and the plane site Cu(2); when Zn is doped to YBCO, it is reported that Zn replaces mostly Cu(2) atoms, leaving the carrier density unchanged . NMR measurements have revealed that nonmagnetic Zn in- duces local magnetic moment by causing a spin ""hole"" in the AF background of the Cu spins . This local moment gives rise to a Curie term in the magnetic sus- ceptibility at low temperatures . In recent years, the effects of Zn-doping on the pseudogap phenomena in the underdoped YBCO have been extensively investigated. Essentially, physical probes that are sensitive to the ex- citations with q=(π, π) [(T 1 T ) −1 in NMR, inelastic neu- tron scattering, etc.] find that Zn-substitution dimin- ishes the pseudogap, while the probes that are only sensi- tive to excitations with q=(0, 0) (magnetic susceptibility, NMR Knight shift, electrical resistivity, etc.) find that pseudogap signatures are intact upon Zn-substitution . The two-dimensional (2D) superconductor-insulator (S- I) transition, which occurs at a critical sheet resistance (per CuO 2 plane) of h/4e 2 (=6.5 kΩ), has also been stud- ied in Zn-doped YBCO . In this transition, Cooper pairs are conjectured to localize in the presence of disor- der ; Zn in this case is considered to introduce dis- order potentials in the usual sense, though the scatter- ing from Zn is maximally large (unitarity limit) .

We can see in Fig. that the effect of Zn-doping in zero field is to reduce T c and simply add some constant residual resistiv- ity (thereby shifting up the ρ ab (T ) curve), as is already reported in the literature. Thus, there is no qualitative difference among the three samples in the zero-field prop- erties. However, under a high magnetic field of 18 T, a drastic difference emerges; z=2.7% sample shows a clear upturn in ρ ab at low temperatures, while other samples with smaller z do not show such clear upturn. We also prepared a slowly-cooled sample to check if the observed localization behavior (dρ/dT <0) in the z=2.7% sample is due to oxygen disorder; essentially the same localization behavior is observed in the slowly-cooled sample, which is supposed to have smaller amount of oxygen disorder (at the expense of transition width). Thus, for the oxygen content of 6.70, we may conclude that 2.7% of Zn induces carrier localization in YBCO at low temperatures in 18 T, irrespective of the annealing procedure.

This value corresponds to k F l ≃8.5, if we use the formula l = hc 0 /ρk F e 2 for 2D electrons (c 0 is the c-axis unit length); therefore, the localization behavior is taking place in quite a clean system where localization is not normally observed .

For this Zn concentration, the charge transport has much weaker tendency towards localization; even y=6.60 sample shows only a slight upturn in 15 T. When the oxygen content is further reduced to 6.50, ρ res exceeds the critical value for the S-I transition and ρ ab (T ) shows an insulating be- havior already in zero field. Comparison between the z=2.7% samples (Fig. ) and the z=2.3% samples (Fig. ) lead to the conclusion that the tendency toward car- rier localization in the high-field normal state becomes much stronger when the Zn concentration is increased from 2.3% to 2.7%. Note that there is no drastic dif- ference between the z=2.7% samples and the z=2.3% samples if we only look at the zero-field data. Now let us discuss the possible origin of the unusual localization behavior. What we observed in Zn-doped YBCO has strong similarities to the unusual localization behavior found in underdoped LSCO : In both systems, the localization behavior takes place in a region of ""clean"" charge transport where k F l is larger than 5; the temperature dependence of the resistivity is consis- tent with log(1/T ) and the size of the increase in resistiv- ity is larger than what is expected from weak localization; the localization behavior shows up at low temperatures only when the superconductivity is suppressed with high magnetic fields. Therefore, it is naturally expected that the localization behaviors observed in the two systems have a common origin. When we look for some common features in the underlying electronic/magnetic structures of the two systems, we hit on the fact that, as mentioned earlier, both systems have some kind of ""defects"" to the AF correlation in the CuO 2 planes; LSCO system is likely to have dynamical charge stripes which separate AF do- mains, while the Zn impurity in YBCO system acts like a point-like defect in the AF correlation.

If so, the charge in cuprates may be carried by a quasipar- ticle which is closely related to the AF correlation, and a local disturbance of the AF correlation, in the presence of a high magnetic field, may strongly scatter the quasi- particle and brings about the unusual charge localization. The fact that the localization behavior is much stronger in the LSCO system (where there is more than a factor of 2 increase in resistivity at low temperatures in 60 T ) may mean that the scattering from 1D defects is much stronger than that from point-like defects.","0"

Similar to the cuprates and heavy fermions, superconductivity in iron arsenides emerges close to the magnetic instability. There are mainly two classes of Fe-arsenides showing superconductivity. RFeAsO crystallizes in the ZrCuSiAs-type structure, composed by alternating (RO) and FeAs layers. The other class of compounds belongs to the well known ThCr 2 Si 2 -type structure (so called 122 family), AFe 2 As 2 (A: Ba, Sr, Eu or Ca) composed of FeAs layers separated by A-layers. Superconductivity in these systems is induced by partial hole or electron doping of the FeAs layers, which otherwise order magnetically. Electron doping has been highly successful for RFeAsO by substitution of oxygen by fluorine or by oxide vacancies, whereas K or Na doping is more successful for AFe 2 As 2 compounds. EuFe 2 As 2 belongs to the so-called 122 family. We have recently performed systematic physical property measurements on EuFe 2 As 2 single crystals and Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 polycrystals .

We have also measured the magnetic penetration depth λ(T ) for polycrystalline samples of Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 , which shows deviations from conventional behavior. A minimum in the penetration depth vs temperature at 4.2 K suggests a strong influence of the Eu magnetic ordering on the supercondusting properties.

Additionally, there is a magnetic contribution from Eu 2+ moments, which could not easily be subtracted from the measured data. For this reason we are limited in the experimental determination of ∆C p /T c . There is a clear anomaly at the SC transition for x= 0.45 and 0.5, which confirms the bulk nature of the phase transition; the AFM ordering of Eu spins is suppressed after K doping. The SC anomaly is clearer in C p /T vs T (lower inset of Fig. ) and a small increase in the electronic specific heat below 10 K is due to the Eu spins.

"264","PR05914099-CC","2","Since the discovery of superconductivity in the cuprate system La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 in 1986 an ever growing vari- ety of high-T c superconducting cuprate compounds has been synthesized all of which contain CuO 2 planes (some also contain CuO chains) as their essential structural el- ements which host the superconducting charge carriers . Between the CuO 2 planes are various kinds of layers, typ- ically NaCl-type, which are insulating and act merely as a charge reservoir. To date, the ruthenate compound Sr 2 RuO 4 is the only known layered perovskite-like sys- tem which becomes superconducting even though it does not contain any CuO 2 planes or CuO chains . Despite its rather low transition temperature T c = 1.5 K the study of its electronic and magnetic properties has become a very rich and active field of research . In parallel, the electronic and magnetic properties of the related ruthen- ate compounds, such as for example the SrRuO 3 system which is an itinerant 4d-band ferromagnet with T Curie ≈ 165 K, have attracted a great deal of interest .","1"
"265","PR05914099-CC","3","Another potentially promising and exciting direction of research has been prompted by the circumstance that the RuO 2 layers share the same square-planar coor- dination and a rather similar bond length with their CuO 2 counterparts. A whole new family of hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compounds may therefore be con- structed whose members consist of different sequences of alternating RuO 2 -and CuO 2 layers. Recently, one such a hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compound, the 1212-type RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 system comprising CuO 2 bilayers and RuO 2 monolayers, has been synthesized as single-phase material . A subsequent study of its electronic and mag- netic properties has revealed that this material exhibits electronic ferromagnetic order at a rather high Curie tem- perature T Curie =133-136 K and becomes superconduct- ing at a significantly lower critical temperature T c =15-40 K (depending on the condition of preparation and anneal- ing) . The most surprising observation, however, is that the ferromagnetic order does not vanish when super- conductivity sets in at T c . Instead, it appears that the ferromagnetic state remains largely unchanged and coex- ists with superconductivity. This finding implies that the interaction between the superconducting-and the ferro- magnetic order parameters is very weak and it raises the question of whether both order parameters coexist on a truly microscopic scale. Since the early investigations of Ginzburg in 1957 the prevailing view is that the coexis- tence of a superconducting-(with singlet Cooper pairs) and a ferromagnetic order parameter is not possible on a microscopic scale since the electromagnetic interaction and the exchange coupling cause strong pairbreaking. Indeed, merely based on magnetisation and transport measurements one cannot exclude the possibility that the RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 samples may be spatially inhomoge- neous with some domains exhibiting ferromagnetic order and others superconducting order . We note that unam- biguous evidence for the occurence of bulk superconduc- tivity in RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 has recently been obtained from specific heat measurements which reveal a sizeable jump at T c of ∆γ ≡ C p /T ≈ 0.35 mJ/g at.K 2 characteristic of a strongly underdoped cuprate superconductor .

This function describes the experimen- tal data rather well and it gives us very reasonable values for the magnetic moments, with µ 1 = 1.05(5) µ B for the moments that order at T Curie and µ 2 = 7.4(1) µ B for the moments that remain paramagnetic below T Curie . The magnetic moment of the paramagnetic component agrees reasonably well with the expected magnetic moment of Gd 3+ which for a free Gd 3+ -ion is µ(Gd 3+ ) = 7.94 µ B and µ(Gd 3+ ) = 7.4 µ B for the structurally-similar GdBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ compound . On the other hand, the value of the Ru-moments with µ(Ru) = 1.05(5) µ B also appears to be reasonable. For Ru 5+ the number of 4d electrons is 3 and the free ion value of the magnetic mo- ment is 3 µ B for the high spin state and 1 µ B for the low spin state. The experimentally observed value of µ(Ru) = 1.05(5) µ B therefore seems to imply that Ru 5+ is in the low spin state.

Firstly, the presence of an oscillating component in the ZF-µSR spectra for T <T Curie = 133 K gives unambiguous evidence for an ordered magnetic state which is homogeneous on a mi- croscopic length scale (of typically 20Å). Secondly, from the amplitude of the oscillating component (A 1 ≈2/3) we can deduce that the magnetically-ordered state accounts for more or less the entire volume of the sample. And thirdly, from the temperature dependence of the µSR signal it becomes clear that the magnetic order persists almost unchanged in the superconducting state.","0"
"282","PR05914099-CC","20","In the following we outline how the volume fraction of the magnetically-ordered phase is obtained from the amplitude of the oscillating component of the ZF-µSR spectra. For a polycrystalline sample with randomly- orientated grains in zero external field the local magnetic field, on average, is parallel (perpendicular) to the di- rection of the muon spin direction with probability 1/3 (2/3). For a homogeneous magnetically-ordered sam- ple one therefore expects that 2/3 of the amplitude of the ZF-µSR signal (the transverse component) exhibit an oscillatory behavior, while 1/3 of the signal (the lon- gitudinal component) is non-oscillating and only slowly damped due to spin-flip excitations. On the other hand, for a sample with inhomogeneous magnetic order, for ex- ample containing non-magnetic regions, the amplitude of the oscillating signal will be accordingly reduced and a second non-oscillating transverse component will ap- pear. If the non-magnetic regions are microscopically small, this non-oscillating component is likely to have a rather large damping rate of the order of λ ∼ γ µ • B µ due to stray fields which are imposed by the neighbor- ing magnetic domains. From Fig. (a) and 7(b) it can be seen that the ZF-µSR data on RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 give no indication for such an inhomogeneous magnetic state. As was mentioned above, the amplitude of the initial muon spin polarization P(t = 0) has been determined from a transverse-field (TF)-µSR measurement. From the size of the amplitude of the oscillatory component we deduce that more than 80 % of the sample is mag- netically ordered below T Curie = 133 K. Based on this analysis we estimate that the volume fraction of any dis- ordered magnetic-or non-magnetic phase must be well below 20%. Note that some of the muons (typically 10- 20 %) do not stop inside the sample but somewhere in the cryostat walls. In the ZF-µSR experiment these muons give rise to a missing fraction since their spin-polarization is much more slowly damped than for the rest of the signal. In the TF-µSR experiment, however, this very slowly damped component can be detected via its pre- cession in the external field and it contributes to the to- tal muon spin polarization P(0). The 80% fraction of the magnetically ordered phase therefore has to be regarded as a lower bound. In fact, it is rather likely that the entire sample volume is magnetically ordered. Finally, we note that the muons apparently occupy only one muon site, since only one precession frequency is seen in the ZF-µSR spectra. Also it is clear from the ZF-µSR data that muon diffusion effects are negligibly small below T Curie = 133 K, similar to the other cuprate superconductors where muon diffusion is observed only at significantly higher temperatures of T ≥ 250 K 13 .","0"
"283","PR05914099-CC","21","It is evident from Fig. that the muon spin pre- cession frequency (the local field at the muon site) does not exhibit any strong anomaly at the superconducting transition temperature T c . Instead, as shown by the dashed line, the temperature of the muon spin preces- sion frequency ν µ (T ) (and thus of the magnetic order parameter) is well described by the function ν µ (T ) = ν o (1 − T /T c ) β , with ν o = 9.7(1) MHz (corresponding to B µ (T → 0) ≈ 720(10) G), T c = 133(1) K, and β = 0.333. This functional form is strictly valid only in the critical regime close to T Curie but it can be seen to provide a reasonable description of the magnetic order parameter over a fairly wide temperature range of T Curie T 5 K. The anomaly at very low temperature arises most likely from the magnetic ordering transition of the Gd-moments at T N ≈2.6 K. Note that for the struc- turally related compound GdBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Gd-123) the antiferromagnetic ordering transition of the Gd-moment occurs at a very similar temperature of T N =2.3K . The value of the critical exponent β = 0.333 is close to the theoretical value 0.345 in the 3D XY model .

Instead, we emphasize that the observed spread in the local magnetic field can be accounted for by the grain boundary effects and by the differences in the demagnetization factors of the individual grains which naturally arise for a polycrystalline sample that has a very small average grain size of about 1 µm 8 . Also, we point out that recent transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM) studies have revealed that our present Ru-1212 sample contains [100] rotation twins and also exhibits some cationic disorder due to the intermixing of Sr ↔ Gd and to a lesser extent of Ru ↔ Cu 8 . These kinds of structural imperfections certainly tend to further in- crease the transverse relaxation rate λ of the ZF-µSR spectra.

"285","PR05914099-CC","23","The temperature dependence of the relaxation rate of the non-oscillating component of the ZF-µSR signal, Λ(T) ∼ 1/T , is shown in Fig. . As a function of decreasing temperature Λ(T ) can be seen to exhibit a cusp-like feature at the ferromagnetic transition of the Ru-moments at T Curie =133 K and a step-like increase at very low temperature which most likely is related to the ordering of the Gd moments. The cusp feature at T Curie = 133 K characterizes the slowing down of the spin dy- namics of the Ru-moments as the ferromagnetic tran- sition is approached. The cusp maximum occurs when the spin fluctuation rate, τ c , equals the typical µSR time scale for τ c ∼ 10 −611 . Note, that in the ferromagnetically- ordered state the longitudinal relaxation rate remains unusually large with values of Λ(T <<T Curie ) ≈ 0.3- 0.4 µs −1 that are at least an order of magnitude larger than expected for a classical ferromagnet (where two- magnon excitations provide the major contribution to spin dynamics). We have confirmed by a µSR measure- ments in a longitudinal field of H LF =6 kOe that this large relaxation rate is indeed characteristic for the lon- gitudinal component of the µSR signal. At present we cannot provide a definite explanation of the origin of the unusually large value of Λ. However, we emphasize that the RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 system can be expected to ex- hibit a rather complex magnetic behavior since, besides the ferromagnetically-ordered Ru moments, it also con- tains the larger Gd moments with µ(Gd 3+ ) ≈ 7.4 µ B which remain paramagnetic below T Curie . The magnetic ordering transition of the Gd moments at T≈2.6 K is evident in the ZF-µSR data in Fig. from the sudden increase in the local magnetic field (or the µSR precession frequency, ν µ ) and a corresponding increase in both relaxation rates, λ and Λ. In addition, we note that recently it has been shown by µSR measurements that in strongly underdoped high-T c cuprate supercon- ductors (like the present RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 compound) also the Cu moments exhibit a spin-glass type freezing tran- sition at low temperature . Finally, it appears that the longitudinal relaxation rate Λ exhibits an additional weak anomaly at a temperature of T≈20 K, i.e. in the vicinity of the superconducting transition at T c =16 K. At present we are not sure whether this effect is related to the onset of superconductivity. From Fig. it appears that the transverse relaxation rate also exhibits a steplike increase in the same temperature range. The local magnetic field at the muon site, however, (see Fig. ) does not seem to exhibit any anomaly in the vicinity of T c . We ex- pect that further µSR measurements on rare earth (RE) substituted RuSr 2 Gd 1−x RE x Cu 2 O 8 samples, as well as on less strongly underdoped samples with higher critical temperatures of T c up to 40 K, should shed more light on the complex magnetic behavior and its interplay with superconductivity in the Ru-1212 system.","1"
"286","PR05914099-CC","24","While the ZF-µSR data give clear evidence for the presence of a homogeneous magnetically ordered state, they do not provide any direct information about the origin of the magnetic moments, the type of the mag- netic order and its direction. Based on dipolar-field cal- culations of the local magnetic field at the muon site, however, one can test the consistency with an assumed magnetic structure. The result of these calculations de- pends on the location of the interstitial muon site and also on the orientation of the Ru-moments. Unfortu- nately, for the Ru-1212 system neither of these is accu- rately known at present. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that the muon site is similar to that in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (and other related cuprate compounds) where the posi- tive muon forms a hydroxyl bond with the apex oxygen and is located at the so-called 'apical-site' near the point (0.12a,0.225b,0.14c) . Indeed, as is summarized in table , we obtain rather good agreement with the experimen- tal value of B µ (T→0) = 720 G if we take a similar apical-site near the point (0.13a, 0.22b, 0.16-0.17c) and assume that the ferromagnetically-ordered Ru-moments (µ(Ru)=1 µ B ) are oriented along the RuO 2 plane ei- ther along the Ru-O bond, [100], or along the diago- nal [110] (see table ). For the [110] orientation, how- ever, there exist two magnetically inequivalent muon sites which should give rise to two distinctive precession fre- quencies in the µSR spectra (which are not observed ex- perimentally). For the Ru-moments oriented perpendic- ular to the RuO 2 layer along the resulting local magnetic field at the apex-site is significantly larger than the experimental value. In order to obtain reasonable agreement with experiment for the [001]-orientation one has to assume that the muon site is located much closer to the CuO 2 planes. Such a muon site, however, is not very realistic (simply speaking the positive muon is re- pelled by the positively charged CuO 2 planes) and has not been observed in any of the related cuprate com- pounds. We thus tentatively conclude that the moments align in-plane consistent with the 2-component XY sce- nario. While this result is rather convenient in terms of the coexistence of the ferromagnetic order of the Ru moments and the superconductivity which resides within the CuO 2 layers as discussed below, one has to keep in mind that the underlying assumptions are rather crude. For more detailed and decisive information on the struc- ture and the orientation of the Ru spin order we must await the result of neutron scattering experiments.","0"
"287","PR05914099-CC","25","Having established that the ferromagnetic and the su- perconducting order parameter coexist on a microscopic scale, we arrive at the important question as to how this system manages to avoid strong pair-breaking effects. We suspect that the answer is closely related to the lay- ered structure of the hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compound and, in particular, to the purely two-dimensional coher- ent charge transport in the strongly underdoped CuO 2 planes. We envisage a scenario where the ferromagneti- cally ordered Ru spins are aligned in the RuO 2 plane hav- ing a very large out-of-plane anisotropy while the charge dynamics of the superconducting CuO 2 planes is purely two-dimensional, i.e., coherent charge transport occurs only along the direction of the CuO 2 planes. For such a configuration the principal pair-breaking effect due to the electromagnetic interaction can be minimized, since the dot product of the magnetic vector potential (which then is normal to the planes) and the momentum of the Cooper pair (which is parallel to the planes) vanishes. An additional requirement is that the direct hyperfine interaction between the superconducting electrons of the CuO 2 planes and the ordered Ru spins has to be ex- tremely small. Both requirements may be fulfilled in the present Ru-1212 system due to the confinement of the superconducting electrons of the strongly underdoped CuO 2 planes. The absence of magnetic pairbreaking is suggested by the fact that the T c value is fully consistent with the underdoped state indicated by the thermoelec- tric power . So far we have been unable to significantly increase the doping state (by e.g. Ca substitution) so as to explore these implications. Furthermore, we have not yet succeeded in crystallographically aligning pow- ders or growing single crystals which would allow one to investigate the magnetic anisotropy. However, further information can be obtained by examining the ferromag- netic fluctuations above T Curie as seen in the divergence of the susceptibility. Figure shows dχ/dT plotted ver- sus (T/T Curie -1) for the zero-field-cooled susceptibility for T >T Curie . The slope of -2.30(3) indicates a critical exponent of γ = 1.30(3) consistent with 3D XY fluctu- ations for which γ = 1.32 18 and again consistent with orientation of the Ru-moments within the a-b plane.","0"

Finally, we note that an alternative (and highly spec- ulative) explanation for the coexistence of high-T c su- perconductivity and ferromagnetic order in the present Ru-1212 superconductor could be that the supercon- ducting order parameter has a non-zero angular momen- tum which itself breaks time-reversal symmetry.

"289","PR05914099-CC","27","In summary, we have performed DC-magnetization and zero-field muon spin rotation (ZF-µSR) measure- ments which characterize the superconducting-and the magnetic properties of the hybrid cuprate-ruthenate compound RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 . The DC-magnetization data establish that this material exhibits ferromagnetic order (or at least magnetic order with a sizeable ferromagnetic component) below T Curie = 133 K and becomes super- conducting at a much lower temperature of T c = 16 K. We obtain evidence that superconducting charge carriers originate from the CuO 2 planes, while the ferromagnetic order is associated with the Ru moments with µ(Ru) ≈ 1 µ B . The larger Gd moments with µ(Gd) ≈ 7.4 µ B do not appear to participate in the ferromagnetic transition but remain paramagnetic to very low temperature and undergo most likely an antiferromagnetic transition at T N =2.6 K. The ZF-µSR experiments provide evidence that the ferromagnetic phase is homogeneous on a mi- croscopic scale and accounts for most of the sample vol- ume. Furthermore, they indicate that the magnetically ordered state is not significantly modified by the onset of superconductivity. This rather surprising result raises the question as to how ferromagnetic and superconduct- ing order can coexist on a microscopic scale while avoid- ing strong pairbreaking effects that tend to destroy su- perconductivity. We have outlined a possible scenario which relies on the two-dimensional charge dynamics of the CuO 2 planes and the assumption that the ferromag- netic order parameter of the Ru-moments is confined to the RuO 2 layers.","1"

In order to obtain a better understanding of these new ma- terials many experiments were performed, but the different experiments were interpreted by different theories. One of the most fundamental evidence that these experiments showed was the interplay among critical temperature T c , hole content n h , and pressure P , since one of the effects of the application of external pressure is a change in the hole content n h in the CuO 2 planes , which results in a large change in T c . The large increase of T c by the appli- cation of pressure has been the motivation for a vast number of works on the study of the effects of pressure on the critical temperature T c of the high temperature superconductors , not only to achieve higher T c but also to obtain a hint for chemical substitution which originates new materials and yields a better understanding of their physical properties.","0"

This proposal was also supported by experimental observations of Hall constant's pressure dependence that confirmed the existence of a growth in n h in the CuO 2 planes when the pressure is applied . Therefore, there is a pressure induced charge transfer (PICT) from the block layers into the CuO 2 planes, that is, n h = n h (P ). Since one expects dT c /dP = 0 at the optimum doping, and T c (n op ) generally increases with P , it is well accepted that the pressure also increases T c by a different mechanism of ""intrinsic"" origin , and such intrinsic term is a characteristic of each family of compounds. Therefore, we can separate these two effects by considering : Here the first term, dT i c /dP , represents the intrinsic contribution, not related to the charge transfer induced by pressure ∂n h /∂P .

The data by Chien, Wang, and Ong indi- cate that R H of optimally-doped crystals increases with increasing z in the whole temperature range above T c and the T dependence becomes less pronounced [it is possible that in their samples the effective carrier con- centration is changing, because the slope of ρ ab (T ) is in- creasing with z]. Mizuhashi et al. reported that R H increases over the whole temperature range with z (al- most like a parallel shifting), while the slope of ρ ab (T ) in the T -linear part is unchanged . On the other hand, Walker, Mackenzie, and Cooper reported that, in their Zn-doped crystalline thin films, R H at 300 K remains essentially unchanged, while at low temperatures R H is progressively suppressed with increasing z . In the present work, we therefore paid particular attention to reduce the errors in the measurement of R H ; the Hall voltage is measured with magnetic-field sweeps at con- stant temperatures, and errors due to the geometrical factors are minimized by making small voltage contacts and by determining the sample thickness with a high ac- curacy. We note that making the voltage contacts on the side faces (not on the top face) of the crystals is essential in reducing the error and increasing the reproducibility.","0"

The measurements are performed with a low-frequency (16 Hz) ac technique. Longitudinal and transverse volt- ages are measured simultaneously using two lock-in am- plifiers during the field sweeps at constant temperatures. For the transverse signal, we achieved a high sensitivity by subtracting the offset voltage at zero field (the offset comes from a slight longitudinal misalignment between the two Hall voltage contacts). The temperature is stabi- lized using a high-resolution resistance bridge with a Cer- nox resistance thermometer. We confined the maximum magnetic field to 4 T, with which the error of the Cer- nox thermometer caused by its own magnetoresistance is negligibly small in the temperature range of the present study. The magnetic field is applied along the c-axis of the crystals. To enhance the temperature stability, the sample and the thermometer are placed in a vacuum can with a weak thermal link to the outside. The achieved stability in temperature during the field sweeps is better than a few mK. The data are taken from −4 T to +4 T, and then the asymmetrical component is calculated to obtain the true Hall voltage. The final accuracy in the magnitude of R H and ρ ab reported here is estimated to be better than ±5%, and the relative error in the data for each sample is less than ±2%.","0"

Our results are somewhat different from previous results on single crystals , but rather resemble that of the thin film result . Notably, R H around 250 K does not change with z, while the peak at 110 K is clearly suppressed with increasing Zn concentra- tion. Still, the behavior of cot θ H is in good agreement with the previous studies; as is shown in Fig. , cot θ H changes approximately as T 2 in a rather wide range, and the Zn impurities add a T -independent offset which is roughly proportional to z. We note that the Zn-doping effect on R H (T ) ob- served here is naturally expected in the context of the two scattering time scenario. One can infer that the primary effect of Zn-doping is to add some constant impurity-scattering rates to both τ −1 tr and τ −1 H , because both ρ ab (T ) and cot θ H (T ) show essentially parallel shifts upon Zn-doping. Since one can approximately express τ −1 tr ∼T and τ −1 H ∼T 2 in pure samples, the scattering rates in Zn-doped samples can be approximated as H is approximately written as R H ∼ (T + A)/(T 2 + B) in Zn-doped samples. If we compare this expression with that for the pure samples, R pure H ∼ T /T 2 ∼ T −1 , we can infer that at high temper- atures R H in Zn-doped sample should approach R pure H , while at low temperatures R H in Zn-doped sample is ex- pected to become smaller than R pure H (which can be eas- ily seen when one considers T →0). The above heuristic argument implies that the weakening of the T depen- dence of R H (T ), combined with a z-independent room- temperature R H , is a rather natural consequence of the Zn-doping in the two scattering time scenario, although this effect has not been well documented before. Now let us analyze the data in more detail in regard of the T dependence of cot θ H . A close examination of Fig. tells us that the data for z=0 and 0.006 are slightly curved in this plot; we found that the best power laws to describe the data in a wide temperature range are T 1.85 , T 1.9 , and T 2.0 , for z=0, 0.006, and 0.013, respectively.","0"

The deviation at T0 is marked by arrows. In Fig. , we show plots of (cot θ H − C)/T α vs T , which cancels out the power-law temperature dependence and therefore we can easily see the temperature range for the T α dependence to hold well. Here, C is the offset value (which increases with z) and α is the best power for each Zn concentration. It is clear from Fig. that the power- law temperature dependence of cot θ H holds very well down to a temperature T 0 (∼130 K) and then starts to deviate in all the three samples. Incidentally, the devi- ation occurs at a temperature very close to T g , which is ∼130 K for y≈6.78 (Ref. ). This is a strong indication that the change in cot θ H (T ) is caused by the opening of the pseudogap . Our result shows that, unlike the Cu NMR relaxation rate, the Zn-doping does not diminish or shift the onset of the pseudogap marked by the change in cot θ H at T 0 , at least up to the Zn concentration of 1.3%. Note, however, that the deviation from the power law becomes a bit weaker (or slower) with increasing z, which is similar to what is seen in the behavior of ρ ab (T ) (inset to Fig. ).","0"
"326","PR06015055-CC","15","Given the fact that cot θ H is apparently affected by the pseudogap below T 0 , it is useful to clarify how the pseudogap effect is reflected in the T dependence of R H , which is a result of the two different T dependences of the more fundamental parameters τ −1 tr and τ −1 H . For this purpose, it is instructive to see how R H (T ) would behave if cot θ H continues to change as T α down to T c . The inset to Fig. shows the plots of the T dependence of such hypothetical R hyp H for the three samples, where R hyp H is calculated by dividing ρ ab by (C + DT α ) × H, where D is the T -independent value at temperatures above T 0 in Fig. . It is clear from the behavior of R hyp H that R H (T ) would not show a peak if cot θ H continues to change as T α down to T c . Therefore, we can conclude that the peak in R H (T ) in underdoped YBCO is caused by the opening of the pseudogap.","0"
"327","PR06015055-CC","16","It should be noted that the direction of the change in cot θ H at T 0 implies that τ −1 H is enhanced when the pseu- dogap opens; this is opposite to the effect on τ −1 tr , which is reduced below T * . Therefore, we cannot simply conclude that the change in cot θ H is caused by a reduced electron- electron scattering, which is the natural consequence of a pseudogap in the low-energy electronic excitations. One possibility to understand this apparently confusing fact is to attribute the change at T 0 to the effective mass, rather than to attribute it to the scattering rate; remember that cot θ H = 1/(ω c τ H ) ∝ m H /τ H , where m H is the effective mass of the particle responsible for the Hall channel , so an increase in cot θ H is expected when the effective mass is enhanced. For example, if the pseudogap is related to the formation of a dynamical charged stripes , a mod- ification in the FS topology, which leads to a change in the effective mass, is expected. This picture is also con- sistent with the observed robustness of the pseudogap feature in cot θ H upon Zn doping, because the change in the FS topology is rather insensitive to a small amount of impurities. One might question why there is little trace of the effective-mass change in the T dependence of ρ ab . If cot θ H and ρ ab reflect different parts of the FS (as is conjectured in the hot/cold spots scenario ), it is pos- sible that the modification of the FS topology alters the band mass for the Hall channel while leaving that of the diagonal channel relatively unchanged.","0"
"328","PR06015055-CC","17","Finally, we note that the peak in the T dependence of R H is not always caused by the pseudogap. For exam- ple, in overdoped Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ (Tl-2201), it has been reported that cot θ H shows a good T 2 dependence down to near T c (which implies that the pseudogap does not open), and yet the peak in R H (T ) is observed at a temperature well above T c . In this case, the peak in R H (T ) is just a result of the two different T depen- dences of τ −1 tr ∼ T n + A (1≤n≤1.9) and τ −1 H ∼ T 2 + B (note that in Tl-2201 both τ −1 tr and τ −1 H have somewhat large offsets even in pure crystals ). Mathematically, R H ∼ (T n + A)/(T 2 + B) has a peaked T -dependence and thus R H (T ) can show a peak well above T c for some combination of A and B, even when both ρ ab and cot θ H do not show any deviation from the power laws. On the other hand, as is demonstrated in the inset to Fig. , the peak in R H (T ) of underdoped YBCO cannot be ac- counted for by the above origin and therefore is clearly caused by the pseudogap. This argument tells us that one should always look at the T dependence of cot θ H , not just the peak in R H (T ), to determine whether the pseudogap is showing up through (ω c τ H ) −1 .","0"
"329","PR06015055-CC","18","In summary, we observed that cot θ H of pure and Zn- doped YBCO (y=6.78) crystals shows an upward devia- tion from the T 2 behavior below a temperature T 0 that is notably higher than T c but is much lower than T * . The onset temperature T 0 for this deviation, which is found to be unaffected by Zn doping, is close to the lower temper- ature scale for the pseudogap T g (probed by the Cu NMR relaxation rate, for example). The fact that cot θ H tends to be enhanced below T 0 suggests that the effect of the pseudogap is not to reduce the Hall scattering rate; we therefore propose that the effect is more likely to be origi- nating from a change in the Fermi surface topology, which causes a change in the effective mass. Also, we demon- strated that the peak in R H (T ) of underdoped YBCO is not just a result of two different scattering times, but is actually a result of the pseudogap effect on cot θ H .","0"

In par- ticular, Millis and Monien attribute the pseudogap (or the spin gap) to strong antiferromagnetic correlations be- tween the planes in the bilayer, which are responsible for a quantum order-disorder transition. Apart from having only one CuO 2 layer La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) is also a good model system for the study of doping dependences since it can be doped by the addition of strontium over a wide range: from the underdoped, where T c increases with Sr content, to the optimally doped where T c reaches its maximum value of ≈ 40 K at x = 0.17, and to the overdoped region where T c → 0 at x = 0.34. The characteristic signatures of the pseudogap state in the dc resistivity are seen clearly in LSCO . These are the striking deviations below a temperature T * from the high temperature linear resistivity, resulting in a clear break in slope at T * . It was found by B. Batlogg et al. that in LSCO T * decreases from 800 K to ap- proximately 300 K as the doping level is increased from the strongly underdoped to just over the optimal doping level. Similar behavior at T = T * has been observed in the Hall effect coefficient and the magnetic susceptibility. The pseudogap can also be observed if the conductiv- ity is measured in the frequency domain, σ(ω), where it shows up as a striking depression of the frequency depen- dent scattering rate at low frequency. It is found that below a frequency Ω p ≈ 600 cm −1 , the scattering rate drops below its high temperature, high frequency, linear behavior. This effect has been clearly identified in the bilayer materials. One of the aims of this paper is to see if this behavior can also be observed in LSCO. A pseudogap state can be defined in terms of this suppres- sion of scattering: the material is in the pseudogap state when the scattering rate falls below the high frequency straight-line extrapolation. In the low frequency limit the scattering rate is proportional to the dc resistivity. Due to this, the 1/τ (ω,T) suppression should be com- pared to the suppression of ρ DC (T) at temperatures below the linear T dependence region.

In the high frequency region, starting at about 700 cm −1 , the scattering rate varies linearly with frequency while in the low frequency region there is a clear suppression of 1/τ (ω,T) below this linear trend. The temperature where this suppression first appears serves as a definition of T * , the onset temperature of the pseudogap state. As the temperature is lowered below T * this suppression becomes deeper. We find that for under- doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 T * ≥ 400 K, an order of magnitude higher than the superconducting transition temperature T c (32 K). This is significantly different from previous results on cuprates where T * more or less coincides with T c near optimal doping.","1"
"356","PR05907184-CC","26","The temperature dependence above 700 cm −1 is strongly influenced by the level of Sr doping. In the underdoped sample the high frequency scattering rate is nearly temperature independent up to a certain tem- perature (Fig. and Fig. ), which we will call T * * above which a pronounced temperature dependence of 1/τ (ω,T) is seen (Fig. and Fig. ). In the x = 0.13 sample T * * ≈ 200 K while in the x = 0.14 sample T * * ≈ 150 K. In the overdoped samples the scattering rate above 700 cm −1 increases uniformly with temper- ature at all temperatures suggesting T * * → 0 in that limit. This behavior is also seen in other overdoped HTSC. If one extrapolates the 300 K scattering rates to zero frequency one finds that for the x = 0.13 sample the scattering rate 1/τ 0 ≈ 2500 cm −1 and for the x = 0.13 sample this rate is ≈ 1500 cm −1 . These scattering rates are much higher than what is seen for the higher T c ma- terials reviewed by Puchkov et al. where at 300 K 1/τ 0 ≈ 1000 ± 200 cm −1 for several families and many doping levels. This high residual scattering differentiates the LSCO material from the other cuprates.","0"

The position of the pseudogap re- mains at 700 cm −1 for all temperatures. There are also several peaks positioned at 500 cm −1 in the scattering rate which complicate the analysis, particularly in the case of the sample with x = 0.14. These peaks have been observed by other groups and have been attributed to po- laronic effects. Another possible explanation is the correlation of the ab-plane conductivity with c-axis LO phonons. We did observe the difference in contribution of LO phonons to the ab plane reflectance with different propagation directions, an effect first observed by Reedyk et al., and also seen in the k c vs. k ⊥ c spectra ob- tained by Tanner's group. In Fig. the reflectance with E a and k c, is compared with the reflectance with E ab and k a, with the La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 sample at room temperature. There is an extra feature observed at 500 cm −1 in the spectra with k c. Further evidence that the c-axis LO phonons couples to ab plane features can be seen in Fig. . The comparison between peaks in the effective scattering rate at 450 cm −1 and 580 cm −1 to the peaks in Im(-1/ǫ c ) shows the same strong correlation seen in many other cuprates. For completeness we also plot the effective mass of un- derdoped samples at low temperatures(Fig. ) and high temperatures(Fig. ). As expected, m * (ω) me rises to a maximum ≈ 3 forming a peak at ≈ 400 cm −1 . The en- hancement of the effective mass in the pseudogap state as well as the upper limit of m * (ω) me are similar to what has been previously reported for Y123, Y124 and Bi2212. Before closing we compare our results with data of Gao et al. on La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ films and Quijada et al. on oxygen doped La 2 CuO 4+δ . Our results in the un- derdoped case are comparable with those of the oxygen doped material, although Quijada et al. did not carry out a frequency dependent scattering rate analysis for their underdoped sample. The film results of Gao et al. are quite different from our findings. The films used in that study had a strontium level that would correspond to optimal doping in crystals. However, the 1/τ (ω) curves deviate markedly from what we observe for slightly under and overdoped samples. The authors performed an ex- tended Drude analysis and found a strongly temperature dependent scattering rate even at low temperatures. This is in sharp contrast to our results which would suggest a very weak temperature dependence in this tempera- ture region. Based on our work, their samples should be in the pseudogap state since they have an x value near optimal doping. Comparing these results with other sys- tems, in particular with Tl2202, two factors suggest the possibility that the films may be overdoped. First, their T c was near 30 K, lower than that expected for optimal doping. Secondly, it is known that the oxygen level in films can vary substantially and in LSCO oxygen can have a major influence on the doping level . On the other hand, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that all the crystal results are affected by the polishing process, and that the films better represent the bulk ma- terial. It is clearly important to measure films where the oxygen content is controlled by selective annealing.","0"

"365","PR06006991-CC","3","A typical study in which a wide temperature window for the normal-state is desirable is the measurement of the temperature dependence of the scattering time. For example, the observation of the T -linear resistivity from 10 K to 700 K in Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6 (Bi-2201) had a strong impact, because it clearly demonstrated the dominance of the electron-electron interaction in the scattering mecha- nism. In high-T c cuprates, it has been discussed that the charge transport is governed by two different scattering times with different temperature dependences ; ac- cording to this ""two-scattering-time"" model, in-plane re- sistivity ρ ab is governed by the transport scattering time τ tr (∼T −1 ) and the Hall angle θ H is governed by the ""Hall scattering time"" τ H (∼T −2 ). However, this idea of ""scattering-time separation"" has not yet gained a com- plete consensus and there are other approaches to un- derstand the unusual normal-state transport properties . Therefore, it would be useful to establish the tem- perature and doping range in which the T 2 behavior of the Hall scattering rate τ −1 H is observed. There are two widely-known cuprate systems which satisfy the requirements of the relatively low T c and the availability of a wide doping range; La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) system and Bi-2201 system. Bi-2201 has not been as intensively studied as LSCO, mostly because of the difficulty in obtaining high-quality single crystals. A number of problems have been known for Bi-2201 crys- tals: (a) the transport properties of B-2201 are quite non-reproducible even among crystals of nominally the same composition ; (b) the residual resistivity of the in-plane resistivity ρ ab is usually large (the smallest value reported to date is 70 µΩcm ), as opposed to LSCO, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO), or Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 (Bi- 2212), where the residual resistivity in high-quality crys- tals is negligibly small; and (c) the temperature de- pendence of the Hall coefficient is weak and thus the Hall angle θ H does not obey the T 2 law , while θ H ∼ T 2 has been almost universally observed in other cuprates . On the other hand, the Bi-2201 system has very attractive characteristics: it has been known for Bi-2201 that the carrier concentration can be widely changed by partially replacing Sr with La (to under- dope) or Bi with Pb (to overdope) ; at optimum dop- ing (Bi 2 Sr 2−x La x CuO 6 with x≃0.4), the maximum T c is about 30 K , which is lower than the maximum T c of LSCO. Therefore, if single crystals of sufficiently high quality are grown, this system would present an ideal stage for the systematic study of the normal-state prop- erties down to lower temperatures than in other cuprates.","1"
"366","PR06006991-CC","4","In this Letter, we report that it is possible to obtain a series of high-quality Bi-2201 crystals and show that in those high-quality crystals the normal-state transport properties display behaviors which are in good accord with other cuprates; for example, in the underdoped re- gion, ρ ab shows a downward deviation from the T -linear behavior at a certain temperature which decreases with increasing doping and, in the overdoped region, T depen- dence of ρ ab changes to T n with n >1. What is new in this system is that the Hall angle indeed obeys a power law T α with α≃2, but the power α shows a systematic decrease towards smaller values as the carrier concentra- tion is increased. This finding of a systematic change of α in a relatively-simple single-layer cuprate system poses a serious question to the universality of the ""Fermi-liquid like"" T 2 behavior of the Hall scattering rate τ −1 H . An- other notable finding is that the ratio of the longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) to the transverse MR increases systematically with decreasing carrier concentration, in- dicating that a spin contribution to the MR gradually becomes significant as the sample becomes more under- doped.","0"

Such a behavior has been cor- related to the opening of a pseudogap . The broad maximum in dρ ab /dT moves to higher temperature as the carrier concentration is decreased, which agrees with the conjecture that the pseudogap opens at higher temper- ature in more underdoped samples.

This observation, combined with the sys- tematic change of the longitudinal MR, might suggest that the T 2 law of τ −1 H is observable only when the spin contribution to the charge transport is strong.

"376","PR04909084-CC","1","We investigate T c and magnetic penetration depth λ(T) near the superconductor-metal quantum phase transition in overdoped La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 films. Both T c and superfluid density n s ,  λ -2 , decrease with overdoping. They obey the scaling relation T c  [λ -2 (0)] α with α  ½. We discuss this result in the frameworks of disordered d-wave superconductors and of scaling near quantum critical points. Our result, and the linear scaling (α  1) found for the more anisotropic T 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ , can both be understood in terms of quantum critical scaling, with different dimensionalities for fluctuations. The superconductor-to-nonsuperconductor transitions in cuprates, as functions of carrier concentration, give insights into quantum phase transitions (QPT's) in general [1] and into the phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity in particular [2-4]. On the underdoped side, the transition is from superconducting to an insulating state with a (pseudo)gap in the electronic excitation spectrum that remains finite through the QPT. The fundamental physics on the overdoped side of the phase diagram is profoundly different because there is no pseudogap, the superconducting gap becomes progressively smaller [5] with doping, and the QPT is from superconductor to a metal that looks like a conventional Fermi liquid in many respects. Key issues are: (i) Are these transitions first-order or are they quantum critical points (QCP) where quantum fluctuations of the order parameter are important? (ii) How does the presence or absence of an energy gap impact the transitions? (iii) Are these transitions driven by a collapse of the pairing amplitude or by fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting order parameter? (iv) Does anisotropy (c-axis vs. ab-plane) affect the dimensionality of the QCP's? T c as a function of hole doping p takes a quasi-universal form [6], with superconductivity existing for 0.3 ≲ p ≲ 0.30, with a maximum at p  0.15, independent of the maximum value of T c or of c vs. ab-plane anisotropy. Thus, one might expect a common explanation for the over-and underdoped quantum phase transitions in different compounds. An early study of several underdoped cuprate compounds suggested that T c and superfluid density [n s  λ -2 , λ = magnetic penetration depth] might be linearly proportional: T c  λ -2 (0), with a universal slope as critical underdoping is approached [7]. This linear scaling led to the widely accepted view that classical thermal phase fluctuations destroy superconductivity [4] in underdoped cuprates when the superfluid density becomes small, even as the energy gap remains intact. This long-standing view was overturned recently by measurements on severely underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-δ (YBCO) films and crystals showing that scaling is actually sublinear: T c  [λ -2 (0)] α with α  0.5. Sublinear scaling, together with the absence of critical thermal fluctuations near T c , pointed to a 3D QCP . The QCP hypothesis was put to a stringent test in a study of two-unit-cell-thick underdoped YBCO films that were 2D by construction. Indeed, linear scaling expected near a 2D QCP was observed for these ultrathin films .","0"

"402","PR05814581-CC","2","The analysis of fluctuations-induced excess conduc- tivity has stimulated in the past years a considerable amount of work. Theoretical investigations of the dc as well as the finite-frequency conductivity dates from the 1960's, and development of this topic proceeded until the discovery of high temperature superconductors (HTSC's). High critical temperatures and short coher- ence lengths conspire to the giant enhancement of ther- modynamical fluctuations in HTCs. Due to their layered structure and to the consequent anisotropy in the su- perconducting state, the effects of thermal fluctuations are further enhanced. As a result, these materials can be viewed as ideal systems to experimentally verify the theories for the excess conductivity. Among the high- temperature compounds with moderate but significant anisotropy, YBCO is the most studied on this aspect, and we will restrict our discussion and measurements to this compound only. Despite the extended experimental investigation, there is a considerable debate on the appropriate model for the fluctuation conductivity in zero magnetic field: most of the existing analysis of the effects of order- parameter fluctuations on the dc conductivity have been performed in terms of Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) isotropic three-dimensional (3D) fluctuations 2 for temperatures close to T c , while a crossover to 2D fluctuations has been claimed at temperatures substantially higher than T c , according to the interpretation of the data in terms of Lawrence-Doniach (LD) model. Not too close to T c , data on YBCO have been shown to be compatible with an AL interpretation supplemented with a Maki-Thompson (MT) term. However this framework has been seriously questioned by Hopfengartner et al : by extending the AL theory to an anisotropic superconductor and introducing a phenomenological cutoff for long wave-vector fluctu- ations they showed that the dc excess conductivity in YBCO films agreed well with the modified AL expres- sion, without the need for MT terms (up to T = 1.1 T c ). Most important, from this kind of analysis no 3D-2D crossover was found in YBCO, in contrast with the ordi- nary LD-like crossover. These interpretations are based on theoretical results ob- tained in the Gaussian approximation. Approaching the critical region close to T c this treatment must be ex- tended to take into account interactions between fluc- tuations. The amplitude of the critical region is theoret- ically predicted to be experimentally accessible for these superconductors, but the actual value of the crossover temperature from Gaussian to critical behavior is still debated. Up to now, the analysis of the dynamical properties near T c have been performed mainly through the compari- son of experimental data with appropriate power laws of the reduced temperature. However, experimental data give controversial results. For example, the dc conduc- tivity above T c 21 and the penetration depth λ(T ) be- low T c 11 have been found to follow a 3D XY-like power law, but Gaussian results for λ(T ) have been recently reported. Moreover, a possible crossover from critical to 2D Gaussian fluctuations has been reported in the mi- crowave conductivity. In fact, simple power laws or scal- ing behaviors, without explicit expressions for the vari- ous quantities, do not allow a quantitative and complete comparison between experiments and theories.","0"
"403","PR05814581-CC","3","Explicit expressions for the finite-frequency conductivity have been recently calculated by Dorsey beyond the Gaussian approximation, using a Hartree approach; in this treatment, confined to an isotropic, three dimen- sional superconductor, a renormalized expression for the 3D isotropic fluctuational conductivity is deduced, ex- plicitly as well as in a scaling form. The basic scaling parameter is the temperature-dependent correlation time τ ∼ ξ z , with the correlation length diverging at T = T c as ξ ∼ ǫ −ν , where sufficiently close to T c , ǫ = (T /T c − 1). Measurements of the complex conductivity as a func- tion of frequency 9 analyzed in terms of the abovemen- tioned theory have revealed a somehow puzzling behav- ior: in fact, the complex conductivity σ (ω) does exhibit a scaling behavior close to the expected one, but the so-obtained critical exponents, ν ≃ 1.2 and z ≃ 2.6, are quite different with respect to the Gaussian values, ν = 0.5 and z = 2; the critical exponent ν is also in con- flict with the prediction for the 3D XY uncharged fluid, ν = 2/3. The determination of the critical exponents close to T c is uncertain: in fact, a different scaling anal- ysis of measurements of the frequency-dependent con- ductivity up to 2 GHz in zero magnetic field gave large exponents, ν ≃ 1.7 and z ≃ 5.6, 10 in contrast with those previously obtained. A noticeable fact in the existing body of experimental data and theoretical models is that the commonly per- formed analyses do not explicitly include the anisotropy, so that an intrinsic feature of HTSC's is lost. In particu- lar, while there are Gaussian theories for the anisotropic fluctuational conductivity, the inclusion of at least a mass tensor in a renormalized theory for the finite- frequency fluctuational conductivity is still missing, at least to our knowledge. Since in materials such as HTSC's the intrinsic anisotropy is one ingredient that possibly makes the departure from Gaussian behavior experimentally observable, we think that a quantitative analysis of the data must be based on the explicit inclu- sion of the anisotropy in the calculations. In this paper we extend the renormalized-fluctuations theory developed by Dorsey by introducing an anisotropic mass tensor, and we compare the results to re- sistive transitions in zero field obtained in dc and at high frequency, above the critical temperature. In Section II, we calculate the Gaussian and renormalized-fluctuations- induced excess conductivity above T c in a uniaxial su- perconductor, subjected to an alternating electric field along the (a, b) planes, stressing the main differences that come out by the introduction of the anisotropy. We write down the explicit expressions for the dynamical conduc- tivity as a function of the frequency and temperature, in terms of physical parameters (coherence lengths, pen- etration depth). In Section III we briefly describe the samples under study, we sketch the experimental appa- ratures and we present the resistive transitions in dc, at 24 and 48 GHz. In Section IV we show that very good fits to the data are obtained with the extended theory here developed, with very reasonable parameters. A smooth departure from Gaussian fluctuations is obtained.","0"
"404","PR05814581-CC","4","To take into account the intrinsic anisotropy of HTSC's , we start from the standard Ginzburg-Landau functional for a uniaxial anisotropic superconductor in presence of an external potential vector A (throughout the paper we use Sistème International units): where e ⋆ = 2e is twice the electronic charge, m x,y = m ab and m z = m c are the masses of the pair along the main crystallographic directions, the coefficient α is a linear function of the reduced temperature α = aǫ, and ǫ = ln(T /T c ) is the reduced temperature. Our aim is to calculate the dynamical conductivity along the (a, b) planes (e.g. the x axis) in presence of an electric field E, or equivalently, a vector potential A. In order to cal- culate a dynamical property of the system, such as the conductivity, we consider the temporal evolution as de- termined by the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equa- tion where Γ 0 is a constant relaxation time; ther- mal fluctuations are represented by the noise term ζ (r, t) with δ function correlation ). We choose the gauge where the scalar potential φ (r, t) = 0. The calculation scheme is as follows: we first compute the conductivity above T c in the linear response in the Gaussian approximation. The result will depend on the temperature through α(T ). Then we renormalize the α parameter by using an Hartree approximation for the quartic term in the GL functional. Inserting the latter in the Gaussian conductivity we get the renormalized result. This approach has been used in Ref. to calculate the linear and nonlinear excess conductivity in an isotropic superconductor. While our analysis explicitly include the anisotropy in the calculation of the linear conductivity, nonlinear effects are beyond the purposes of this paper. The response of the system to the in-plane field A(t) is determined by the current operator averaged with respect to the noise (here represented by the brackets): it can be expressed as a function of the correlation function of the order parameter C (r, t; r ′ , t ′ ) = ψ (r, t) ψ ⋆ (r ′ , t ′ ) : where the momentum dependence has been shifted from k to the new vector q = k + (e ⋆ /h) A (t). As a first step (Gaussian approximation), we neglect the non linear term β |ψ| 2 ψ. Eq.1 is then exactly solvable, and for the correlation function one gets: In the frame of the linear response, the quadratic terms in the vector potential can be neglected. Using the ex- pression found for the correlation function, Eq.4, the cur- rent operator in Eq.3 becomes After Fourier transformation, one has After integration, Eqs.6 and 7 can be written as: where S + (x) and S − (x) are the scaling functions as can be found in Ref. (the subscript g means that this result is obtained in the Gaussian approximation), and they have the property that S + (x → 0) = 1 and where the relaxation time Γ 0 = (8k B T /hπa) is evalu- ated from the microscopic theory 1 and ξ c0 =h/(2m c a) is the zero temperature c-axis correlation length. Before proceeding further to the renormalization, some com- ments are in order. Eq.8 contains all the previously ob- tained results in various limits: as ω → 0 Eq.8 gives the dc, anisotropic AL result. As expected, at nonzero fre- quencies the conductivity does not diverge at T c , due to the vanishing of the scaling functions S ± when written in terms of the temperature. Moreover, the result in Eq.8 agrees with the one calculated by a different approach by Klemm. The isotropic result is recovered by simply putting ξ c0 = ξ. The introduction of the anisotropy leads to an enhancement by a factor of γ = ξ ab0 /ξ c0 in the pref- actor of the fluctuation conductivity, as seen by the fact that Eq.8 contains only the short coherence length ξ c0 . However, in the Gaussian approximation, the character- istic frequency remains unchanged with respect to the isotropic result. This is no longer true in the renormal- ized regime, as we show below. Approaching T c , the Gaussian approximation breaks down. We extend our calculation to this region by con- sidering the effects of the interaction term β |ψ| 2 ψ of the Landau-Ginzburg functional through the Hartree ap- proximation: we replace the non-linear term by its aver- age value and put it in a renormalization of the parameter α. The renormalized parameterα represents the renormalized temperature dependence and it is defined through this self-consistency equation. All the quantities above calculated in the Gaussian approximation contain the temperature dependence through the parameter α; hence, the relations found can be easily extended to the critical region by replacing α →α. In particular, the correlation function is formally identical to the one determined by means of Eq.4; evalu- ating it with an electric field along the x-axis in the frame of the linear response approximation, Eq.10 becomes: where α c is the bare α parameter evaluated at the renormalized critical temperatureT c at which the pa- rameterα vanishes: α c = α(T =T c ) = a ln T c /T c . The self consistency equation, Eq.11, can be usefully interpreted as the relation which determines the renor- malized correlation length along the (a, b) where w = e 2 µ 0 k B T /πh 2 , µ 0 is the magnetic per- meability of vacuum, γ = (ξ ab0 /ξ c0 ) is the anisotropy factor and κ = (λ ab0 /ξ ab0 ) is the Ginzburg parame- ter, which is related to the coefficient β of the Landau- Ginzburg functional through the London equation. The renormalized coherence length follows the usual, Gaus- sian temperature behavior ǫ −ν with ν = 1/2 sufficiently far away from T c , but approaching the critical temper- ature it diverges with the critical exponent ν = 1, as depicted in Fig. A smooth crossover between these two power laws is then obtained by varying the temperature (Fig.). It is interesting to note that, while the exponent ν = 1 is recovered only very close to T c, a substantial departure from the Gaussian value ν = 1/2 is obtained at rather high temperatures, and this regime is very well approximated by an exponent ν = 2/3. Once the renor- malized coherence length is obtained, the conductivity can be immediately written down by substituting ξ ab (T ) withξ ab (T ), and one gets andτ = 1/Ω(T ) plays the role of the renormalized scattering time. Expression (13) takes then the form of the renormalized dc excess conductivityσ dc (T ) times a frequency-dependent contribution. As it can be noted from Eq.12, the expression for the fluctuation conductiv- ity depends on a limited number of parameters, namely the bare quantities ξ ab0 , γ and κ, beingT c the only renor- malized parameter. We note that now the (renormalized) scattering time does depend on the anisotropy, differ- ently from the Gaussian result, Eq.9. As expected, in the limit γ = 1 our results coincide with the isotropic calculation. We stress, however, that the anisotropy γ does not enter in a trivial way in the renormalized quan- tities: it enters through different combinations in the prefactor ofσ and in the renormalized scattering time. In particular, our calculation cannot be simply mapped onto the isotropic result by the use of some ""lumped"" parameter in the fitting: γ is an independent parameter.","0"

All samples were highly c-axis oriented, as indicated from the θ − 2θ rocking curve. Twinning is largely present in all samples (as usual in films). Thicknesses ranged from 0.08 to 0.5 µm. The main features are presented in Table . It is worth mentioning that samples II and III are of inferior quality, as can be seen, e.g.,by the fact that the normal state resistivity is 2-3 times higher than in the other films. Microwave resistivity measurements were performed on as-deposited samples I-IV. The microwave response was investigated at 48 and 24 GHz, in samples I-III and IV, respectively. Extensive descriptions of the experimen- tal systems have been given previously, and we give here only a short sketch. Two experimental systems were employed. In both cases we made use of the cavity-end- wall-replacement method: the sample is mounted in or- der to replace one end-wall of a mechanically tunable right-cilynder resonant cavity. The cavities were designed to work in absorption in the TE 011 mode, at 24 [cavity (a)] and 48.2 GHz [cavity (b)], with quality factors of about 15000 and 6000, respectively. The relatively low quality factor prevented an accurate measurement of the absolute surface resistance below ∼ 70K, but allowed us to obtain reliable measurements in the whole transition range and well above T c . As described in Ref. , the unloaded quality factor Q of the cavities was measured by recording the (Lorentzian) resonance shape as a func- tion of the slowly (∼ 0.2 K/min) increasing temperature. Changes of Q reflect the changes in the microwave sur- face resistance. A calibration of the cavity response is in principle needed to obtain the absolute surface resis- tance, but since below ∼ 70 K the changes in Q cannot be resolved due to the reduced sensitivity of the cavities, data presented as: are independent on the calibration (a detailed discus- sion can be found in Ref. ). This is equivalent to take as zero the low-temperature value of R S . Here G is a known geometrical factor. The real part of the microwave resistivity is directly ob- tained from the data due to the reduced sample thick- ness d. For samples thinner than twice the penetration depth (the skin depth δ in the normal state, the London penetration depth λ in the superconducting state) the measured surface resistance directly gives the real part of the resistivity through: A detailed study of the applicability range of this ap- proximation can be found in Ref. . We notice, however, that we are interested in measurements close and above T c, where λ is much longer than the zero-temperature value. Consequently, Eq.16 is valid up to (at least) 3%, 32 also in the thicker film.","0"

"409","PR05814581-CC","9","We proceed here to the fitting of the zero-field resis- tive transitions above T c on the five samples with the proposed model.

Here,σ f l (T, ω) is the fluctuational conductivity and ρ n (T ) is the measured normal-state resistivity. The latter is linear above ∼120 K, and it was linearly extrapolated down to T c . Fits of the experimental data with the real part of Eq.17 can now be made. The theoretical expression depends on four independent parameters, that can be chosen to be the bare ξ ab0 , λ ab0 and γ, and the renormalized critical temperatureT c (which is, in this frame, the experimen- tally observable critical temperature). With the present interpretation, no information comes from the data for the bare critical temperature, T c . Before commenting on the fits, a few notes should be added. First of all, as common to many calculations of the fluctuational conductivity, 14 the theory overesti- mates the fluctuational contribution for T ≫ T c . This is true also at zero frequency. In fact, calculations of the dc excess conductivity in the Gaussian approxima- tion, explicitly including a high-q cutoff in the various integrations in the momentum space show a drastic and sharp suppression ofσ (T, ω = 0) at sufficiently high T (above ∼120 K for YBCO).","0"

Scattering of the data above Tc are due to the sensitivity limit of the cavity. Inclusion of such a cutoff in the frequency-dependent fluctuational conductivity is beyond of the scope of this paper. Instead, we will phenomenologically take into account this effect by making the physically reasonable assumption that at sufficiently high temperature (say, 150 K) the fluctuational conductivity is no longer re- solved in the measurements. As a consequence, we will write the dc excess conductivity in Eq.13 (and then in Eq.17) asσ dc (T ) −σ dc (150 K). Other possible choices consist essentially of taking a normal-state resistivity which is higher than the measured one or with a dif- ferent shape with respect to the linear extrapolation.

"411","PR05814581-CC","11","A second point comes from the fact that the HF renor- malization here presented is perfomed in the adiabatic limit, that is ω/Ω(T ) ≪ 1. As a consequence, we expect that ω/Ω(T ) ≈ 1 is a limit for the accurate applicability of such calculations, while the main features might ap- ply also beyond this point until the HF approach breaks down very near T c . SinceΩ T →T c → 0, all the fits were performed self-consistently, excluding the data points with temperatures lower than those for which ω/Ω(T ) = 1. This requirement, together with the ex- pected cutoff at high temperature, resulted in fits being performed using the data from about 0.5 K above the critical temperature, up to ∼120 K. With these cares, we performed the fits with the fluc- tuational conductivity here calculated. The results are reported in Figs.2,3 and 4. As can be seen, all the fits are very satisfying, and the anisotropic renormalized fluctu- ational conductivity seems to be a good description of the data.

"413","PR05814581-CC","13","As in Fig.2, for the microwave resistivity at 24 GHz on the laser-ablated sample IV. We mention that our data might be equally well fitted with the original isotropic theory . However in this case the parameters attain unrealistic values. As an example, on sample I one would get a fit with the isotropic theory almost indistinguishable from the one obtained with the anisotropic theory with ξ = 2.6Å. Since here ξ is an isotropic coherence length, it is reasonable to assume ξ = (ξ 2 ab ξ c ) 1/3 = ξ ab /γ 1/3 . For ξ ab ≈ 15Å one would get γ ≈ 200, more than an order of magnitude higher than known values in YBCO. The Gaussian anisotropic theory (Eq.8) can be made to fit the data only in the high part of the resistive transitions. An example is reported in the inset of Fig. It is apparent that the Gaussian approximation does not reproduce at all the shape of the resistive transition. A final note on the 3D-2D dimensional crossover that might be expected at high temperatures, owing to the decrease of the c-axis coherence length: being our calculation explicitly 3D, such a crossover is not included there. However, it seems that at least up to ∼120 K the data are well described by the anisotropic 3D theory. This behavior is com- pletely analogous to the results obtained in dc, where a Gaussian analysis of the data sufficiently above T c did not show any dimensional crossover, the departure from the AL anisotropic 3D behavior being fully accounted for by the introduction of the cutoff in q-space. It would be consistent also with the fact that, on a pure numerical ground, the renormalized coherence length is longer than the bare one, so that the crossover temperature shifts to higher T , where this phenomenon might be hardly distin- guishable from the short-wavelength-fluctuation regime. This point deserves further study in the future.","0"

The intrinsic Josephson junctions of LSCO have re- cently been characterized as stacked serial SIS junctions , and its high Josephson plasma fre- quency in THz region is quite interesting for de- veloping new electronic devices such as THz gen- erators and detectors . On the other hand, its electronic states strongly depend on hole-doping which can be achieved with the substitution of Sr 2+ cations for La 3+ ones. At very low doping (x < 0.02), La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 is an antiferromag- netic Mott insulator. After crossing a spin glass state (0.02 < x < 0.05) , it becomes a super- conductor (0.05 < x < 0.26) and then changes to a normal metal (0.26 < x < 0.6) and fi- nally it behaves as a semiconductor (x > 0.6) . In the superconductor regime, the critical temperature of LSCO reaches its maximum of 38 K at x = 0.15. The investigation on the doping dependences of low temperature physical proper- ties in both normal and superconducting states is important for acquiring a better understanding of high T C superconductivity and strongly cor- related electron systems.

It was anticipated at a very early stage that electron-electron interactions are controlled by the Hund's rule coupling , and it was later shown within the dynamical mean-field theory that the electrons are subject to strong Hund's rule correlations, while the system remains metallic and far from the Mott insulator regime . Mean-field density-functional theory (DFT) cal- culations within the generalized-gradient approximation are unstable against ferromagnetism . Even though strong correlations lead to fluctuations suppressing this instability, there still remains a substantial Stoner renorm- alization of the uniform spin susceptibility.

"462","PhysRevX.9.021044-CC","5","An additional feature is the proximity to a 2D Lifshitz point associated with a van Hove singularity (VHS), and the question as to its relationship to both normal state properties and nature of the superconducting state. Recently, striking physical property changes, including a factor of 2.5 increase in superconducting critical temper- ature T c from 1.4 to 3.5 K accompanied by a pronounced non-Fermi-liquid behavior of the resistivity were observed under application of in-plane strain ε aa . This was tentatively interpreted as a Fermi-level crossing of the VHS when ε aa reaches a critical value ε v . Since direct experimental evidence is still lacking, it is important to test this interpretation in complementary studies of the normal state while subject to strain. Also, the VHS is expected to influence quite differently the triplet and singlet super- conducting states, and this provides further motivation for physical property studies under strain. For singlet pairing, the order parameter (SC gap) can be large at the VHS (e.g., for the d x 2 −y 2 symmetry), and thus, the local density- of-states (DOS) enhancement at the VHS is very beneficial. On the contrary, the triplet order parameter at precisely the Lifshitz point is zero by symmetry, and therefore, a triplet state is less suited to take advantage of the VHS unless the pairing interaction itself is enhanced. Since the DOS enhancement brings the system closer to ferromagnetism, the latter case is possible .","0"

Indeed, the enhancement is evident in the results presented, and moreover, the inferred enhancement semi- quantitatively accounts for the transport results in Ref. .

The specific objective is to extract at least semiquantitative information about the origin, evolution, and relative importance of the various individual contributions to the net Knight shifts. A local density approximation for the exchange-correlation func- tional, a k-point mesh of 41 × 41 × 41, and the expansion parameter RK max ¼ 7 are utilized. Further, the optimized structures of Ref. are used and then interpolated to assure that the strain at which the VHS crosses the Fermi level is included. It turns out that the proximity to a (ferromagnetic) quantum critical point forces some adjust- ments to the standard procedure. One reason lies with the mean-field approach: DFT overestimates the tendency to magnetism, because in reality, the Hund's rule derived interaction I and, correspondingly, the Stoner renormaliza- tion S, are reduced by quantum fluctuations that are not accounted for. A second challenge originates with the very narrow calculated DOS singularity at the VHS: In relation to the Knight-shift evaluation, an external magnetic field is applied followed by the computation of generated hyper- fine fields. The singularity full width at half maximum is approximately 3 meVand holds only 0.0015 e − in each spin channel. As a result, an external field producing sufficiently strong hyperfine fields (compared to the computational noise), is too large to properly monitor the VHS peak. Nevertheless, the calculations at the larger fields produce useful information, in part because the origin of the net Knight shifts in terms of individual contributions is obtained.","0"

For computational purposes, this partitioning of the hyperfine field contributions can be summarized as where s is the spin moment of an electron, and L its orbital moment. Real-space integration results in the total local field. Note that h s has no anisotropy, while h d gives no isotropic contribution (h o has both).

In addition, there is another orbital term (paramagnetic van Vleck), which is not enhanced in the same way as χ s . While usually considered small , an accurate accounting is not expected in the DFT framework. As indicated by Eqs. and , the strain-dependent enhancement of S is important as a mechanism for transferring anomalous responses (linked to the VHS) to orbitals other than Ru d xy and the corre- sponding hybridizing Op. Notable also is that, in principle, S can be more sensitive to the enhancement of the DOS than χ s itself. To establish relevance, consider that inelastic neutron-scattering measurements indicate χ s is enhanced by about a factor of 7 compared to the DFT DOS, viz., ½χ s ðε aa ¼ 0Þ=χ DFT s0 ðε aa ¼ 0Þ ∼ 7 , with the enhance- ment originating from a mass renormalization factor (m Ã =m 0 ∼ 3.5 ), and an inferred Stoner factor (S ∼ 2).

The standard calculations, such as those presented in Ref. , are unstable against spontaneous formation of a ferromagnetic state. The tendency toward this instability is reduced somewhat arbitrarily by scaling the Hund's coupling by half. This ensures numerically stable calcu- lations in external fields up to at least 5 T, even at ε aa ¼ ε v . The impact of the reduced Hund's coupling appears to produce systematic errors in related absolute parameters but less so for the relative changes induced by strain. For example, for the selected scaling, indicates that the calculated χ DFT s ðε aa ¼ 0Þ renormalization is approximately 1.6, whereas the known correlation-induced mass enhance- ment is about 3.5 . Therefore, the downscaling is too strong. Given this caveat, at the critical strain, χ DFT s ðε aa ¼ ε v Þ is enhanced over χ DFT s ðε aa ¼ 0Þ by about 70%, while Sðε v Þ itself is enhanced by a much smaller factor, about 30% over Sð0Þ [right frame of ].

The former enhancement matches the data in well, as well as the calculations presented in . The latter enhancement of 30% is relatively larger than the experimental results [], as well as the calculations [], which are both ≃10%.

Associated with the enhanced S is an intensification of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations and strong nonlinearities in the spin susceptibility to the lowest temper- atures studied. This finding has immediate ramifications for superconductivity. Namely, first, the DOS is enhanced near the VHS point. In the first approximation, this effect strongly favors some singlet pairings, such as extended s, d zx AE id yz , or d x 2 −y 2 mildly favors the d xy pairing and less so any triplet pairing. However, this enhancement of the DOS through the Stoner factor boosts ferromagnetic spin fluctuations, which favors triplet states and seems to disfavor singlet pairing.

"494","EPL0580589","3","High-temperature superconductors (HTSs) have emerged with properties that are very different from those found in conventional superconductors. One such property of the under- doped phase is the presence of a pseudogap observed well above T c, up to a characteristic temperature T *, that has been detected by a number of experimental techniques, such as in-plane resistivity, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), specific heat, and NMR . One reason why the presence of the pseudogap garners a lot of attention is that it might be related to the phenomenon of superconductivity in HTSs. Numerous theories have been proposed to explain the origin of the pseudogap in the underdoped phase, such as pairing fluctuation theory, spin-charge separation scenario, phase fluctuations .","0"
"495","EPL0580589","4","While it is generally accepted that the pseudogap is a property of the underdoped phase, it is still debatable whether it is also present in the overdoped region. Whereas T * can be determined in various experiments (e.g., a change in slope of in-plane resistivity vs. T ) a corresponding direct measurement of a pseudogap in the density of states is not always avail- able. For overdoped HTSs, none of the experimental techniques listed earlier have detected a clear pseudogap . Some results from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and planar tunnel junctions have suggested that the pseudogap exists at all hole doping concentrations in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ (Bi-2212). In contrast, another STM study in the ab-plane of Bi-2212 does not show any gap-like feature in the overdoped phase . These conflicting observations hinder our understanding of the pseudogap and demand further tunneling investigations of the overdoped phase of Bi-2212. One reason for the conflict might be that the doping level of Bi-2212 in the region of the junction is not the same as in the bulk. Miyakawa et al. have demonstrated a clear relationship between the energy gap (∆) and hole concentration and therefore the measured gap provides important information on the local doping level. Here we report measurements of heavily overdoped crystals (T c = 56 K) that exhibit a ∆ value as low as 10.5 meV, much smaller than the optimal doped value of 38 meV and clearly in the overdoped state.","1"
"496","EPL0580589","5","The break junction method can be used to measure the superconductor-insulator-supercon- ductor (SIS) tunneling conductance in conventional and HTSs. One advantage of this method is that the junction can be fabricated at low temperatures so that it is unexposed to air. The SIS tunneling spectroscopy is not only capable of measuring quasiparticle excitations but also the Cooper pairs in the form of the Josephson current, I c , which is purely a superconducting phenomenon. This capability provides an important advantage since I c (T ) → 0 defines the junction T c. In other words, the phase coherence temperature can be identified by measuring the temperature dependence of the critical current.","0"
"497","EPL0580589","6","Single crystals of Bi-2212 were grown by a self-flux technique in a strong thermal gradient to stabilize the direction of solidification. Overdoping was accomplished using stainless-steel cells sealed with the sample immersed in liquid oxygen . The critical temperature of the samples was determined from the magnetization which showed sharp transitions. Tunneling measurements were done with a point contact apparatus . The Bi-2212 crystal is cleaved along the ab-plane and mounted on a substrate so that the tip approaches along the c-axis. A novel method is used to form the SIS break junctions. A differential micrometer-driven Au tip approaches the sample at LHe temperature and superconductor-insulator-normal- metal (SIN) junctions are first formed. These conductances exhibit quasiparticle peaks at eV ∼ ±∆ and clearly show the standard dip and hump features above ∆ in the occupied part of the DOS . Further increasing the force of the tip leads to an Ohmic contact (less than 10 ohm) with the crystal and a mechanical bond. A Bi-2212 piece is easily dislodged by cleaving along the double Bi-O layer. As a result of this process, an SIS junction forms between the Bi-2212 piece and the rest of the crystal. The SIS conductances show quasiparticle peaks at ±2∆ that are consistent with the ∆ value obtained from the SIN junctions. Additionally, the SIS conductances also show a symmetric dip, hump and background, and also the presence of a Josephson current. The magnitude of this current generally decreases as the junction resistance increases. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the tunneling conductance for junction # 1 on the heavily overdoped Bi-2212. The 4.2 K data show a tunneling conductance of a Bi-2212 break junction with sharp quasiparticle peaks at ±2∆, a weak Josephson current peak at zero bias, and the dip and hump features above ±2∆. One of the distinct features of this junction is the relatively flat background. This is different than the typical SIS conduc- tances found from optimally doped and overdoped Bi-2212 that show a decreasing background up to ±350 meV. For SIS junctions at low temperatures, the thermal smearing is minimal and the quasiparticle peaks can be used to estimate the energy gap size, which is 14 meV for the 4.2 K spectra in , giving a coupling ratio 2∆/kT c ∼ 5.8.

"498","EPL0580589","7","as in , we do not observe the Josephson current.

The energy gap magnitude found from tunnel- ing is consistent with that observed in recent ARPES measurements around (π,0) on similar crystals . Using the bulk T c , the coupling ratio 2∆/kT c is 4.35, which is very close to the BCS mean field d x 2 −y 2 -wave (d-wave) prediction of 4.28.

Additionally, the magnitude of the Josephson current peak in (a) diminishes until it vanishes around T c . This is further evidence that the junction T c is the same as the bulk value. Both figures show no presence of any depression above T c such as is observed in underdoped Bi-2212 . Note the increased sensitivity of the vertical scale in for the higher-temperature data. For comparison, we show some previously published data on underdoped Bi-2212 in . The superconducting gap is washed out around the bulk T c = 77 K of the crystal but a weak depression in the conductance remains which is consistent with a pseudogap. The absence of any pseudogap in our present measurements is consistent with recent ARPES studies on the same type of samples. In that study, the midpoint of the spectral weight peak shifted to the Fermi level at T c , showing no evidence of the pseudogap that is seen in optimally doped or underdoped Bi-2212 . Thus, there are now two measurements which show that the pseudogap disappears in heavily overdoped Bi-2212.","1"

Both sets of data exhibited a pseudogap above T c ; however, the overdoped tunneling conductance showed a smaller gap which fills in at a much lower temperature than underdoped and thus T * is closer to T c .

There are ARPES observations that suggest s-wave BCS behavior in the heavily overdoped phase . However, the tunneling subgap conductance shapes at low tempera- tures in figs. 1(a) and (b) are not consistent with the s-wave BCS theory prediction which is supposed to be flat near zero bias.

The SIS conductance is calculated by where c is a proportionality constant. F (E) is the Fermi function. The formula also includes a directionality function f (θ)=1+α cos(4θ) which corresponds to a preferred tunneling along the d-wave lobes. Here α is the directionality strength, which is assumed temperature independent (α = 0.4) . The fit (solid line in ) shows good agreement in the subgap region with the experimental data. Thus there appears to be no change of symmetry away from d-wave. However for |eV | > 2∆ the data deviate from the BCS d-wave fit, exhibiting broader peak widths and the dip feature. In general, these features are compensating which allows conservation of states; however, the data in lead to an integrated area out to 150 meV which is about 6% above the BCS d-wave fit. We attribute the discrepancy to the inability to accurately know the background conductance at 4.2 K. The broad peaks and dip feature are observed throughout the doping range and have been attributed to strong-coupling effects .","1"

What they find in their model fit to the tunneling conductance of underdoped Bi-2212 data is that the gap is decreasing until 3/4 of T c , and sharply increases near T c . This unusual effect seems to be tied to the presence of a pseudogap. In the present study, we show that the gap magnitude for heavily overdoped Bi-2212 shows no anomalies near T c but continues to decrease and appears to close near the bulk T c value. and (c) shows the d-wave fit for T c = 48 K and 55 K.

Here T * is obtained from various experimental techniques including SIS break junctions using STM . Extrapolating T * to the overdoped phase suggests that T c and T * are very close and might even merge in the overdoped region. This might be the reason that we do not observe a pseudogap in our tunneling studies. The implication of the doping dependence of superconducting energy gap and T * is that they are intimately related. The simplest notion is that T * represents the mean-field temperature for pairing, whereas T c defines when long- range phase coherence is established. However, if the two temperatures were distinct over the entire doping range, then that would suggest that T * corresponds to physics distinct from superconductivity. Our present result suggests that there is a particular doping value where the two temperature scales merge and this provides further support for pseudogap models based on superconducting fluctuations .","0"

On the other hand, the BiS2 layer in F-doped crystal contains 0.27 electron carriers from substituted F of ~0.27 per CeO unit according to the EPMA estimation. These results suggest that the total carrier number is comparable to each other. There still remains a question why the Tc of the CeOBiS2 at ambient pressure is only 1.5 K, which is considerably lower than that of Ce(O,F)BiS2. It might be attributed to the effective carrier numbers in BiS2 plane. The BiS2 layer in CeOBiS2 is little bit corrugated compare to that is in Ce(O,F)BiS2. When the external pressure was applied, the corrugation in the BiS2 layers would be expected to be flatter than that is in ambient pressure. This results in increase of the effective carrier number contributed to the conduction nature. In other words, the carrier number in BiS2 layers would be increased by applying pressure. It is reasonable that the comparable Tc's of CeOBiS2 under high pressure and Ce(O,F)BiS2 are attributed to the total effective carrier numbers in the individual crystals.","1"

"553","Drozdov_etal_2015","1","A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity without resistance below a superconducting transition temperature, T c . The highest T c that has been achieved to date is in the copper oxide system : 133 kelvin at ambient pressure and 164 kelvin at high pressures . As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional superconduc- tors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition tempera- tures by this route are not clear. In contrast, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide for achieving high T c with no theoretical upper bound-all that is needed is a favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon coupling, and a high density of states . These conditions can in principle be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen , as hydrogen atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron-phonon coupling. Numerous calculations support this idea and have predicted transition temperatures in the range 50-235 kelvin for many hydrides , but only a moderate T c of 17 kelvin has been observed experimentally . Here we investigate sulfur hydride , where a T c of 80 kelvin has been predicted . We find that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approxi- mately 90 gigapascals. On cooling, we see signatures of supercon- ductivity: a sharp drop of the resistivity to zero and a decrease of the transition temperature with magnetic field, with magnetic sus- ceptibility measurements confirming a T c of 203 kelvin. Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of T c in sulfur deuteride is suggestive of an electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is con- sistent with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer scenario. We argue that the phase responsible for high-T c superconductivity in this system is likely to be H 3 S, formed from H 2 S by decomposition under pressure. These findings raise hope for the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other hydro- gen-based materials.","1"
"554","Drozdov_etal_2015","2","A search for high-(room)-temperature conventional superconduct- ivity is likely to be fruitful, as the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory in the Eliashberg formulation puts no apparent limits on T c . Materials with light elements are especially favourable as they provide high frequencies in the phonon spectrum. Indeed, many superconduc- tive materials have been found in this way, but only a moderately high T c 5 39 K has been found in this search (in MgB 2 ; ref. 11).","1"
"555","Drozdov_etal_2015","3","Ashcroft turned attention to hydrogen, which has very high vibra- tional frequencies due to the light hydrogen atom and provides a strong electron-phonon interaction. Further calculations showed that metallic hydrogen should be a superconductor with a very high T c of about 100-240 K for molecular hydrogen, and of 300-350 K in the atomic phase at 500 GPa (ref. ) . However, superconductivity in pure hydrogen has not yet been found, even though a conductive and prob- ably semimetallic state of hydrogen has been recently produced . Hydrogen-dominated materials such as covalent hydrides SiH 4 , SnH 4 , and so on might also be good candidates for showing high-T c superconductivity . Similarly to pure hydrogen, they have high Debye temperatures. Moreover, heavier elements might be beneficial as they contribute to the low frequencies that enhance electron-phonon coup- ling. Importantly, lower pressures are required to metallize hydrides in comparison to pure hydrogen. Ashcroft's general idea was supported in numerous calculations 7,10 predicting high values of T c for many hydrides. So far only a low T c (,17 K) has been observed experiment- ally .","1"
"556","Drozdov_etal_2015","4","For the present study we selected H 2 S, because it is relatively easy to handle and is predicted to transform to a metal and a superconductor at a low pressure P < 100 GPa with a high T c < 80 K (ref. ) . Experimentally, H 2 S is known as a typical molecular compound with a rich phase diagram . At about 96 GPa, hydrogen sulphide trans- forms to a metal . The transformation is complicated by the partial dissociation of H 2 S and the appearance of elemental sulfur at P . 27 GPa at room temperature, and at higher pressures at lower tempera- tures . Therefore, the metallization of hydrogen sulphide can be explained by elemental sulfur, which is known to become metallic above 95 GPa (ref. .

As higher temperatures of 150-250 K were involved in this pressure range, we supposed that the increase of T c and the decrease of sample resistance during warming ) could indicate a possible kinetic-controlled phase transformation. Therefore in further experiments, after loading and after the initial pressure increase at 200 K, we annealed all samples by heating them to room temperature (or above) at pressures of .,150 GPa , see also Extended Data ). This allowed us to obtain stable results, to compare different isotopes, to obtain the dependence of T c on pressure and magnetic field, and to prove the existence of supercon- ductivity in our samples as follows.

"561","Drozdov_etal_2015","9","low-temperature runs possibly relates to H 2 S, as it is generally consistent with calculations 10 for H 2 S: both the value of T c < 80 K and its pressure behaviour. However superconductivity with T c <200 K does not follow from these calculations. We suppose that it relates to the decomposition of H 2 S, as high temperatures are required to reach the high T c . Precipitation of elemental sulfur on decomposition could be expected (which is well known at low pres- sures of P , 100 GPa; ref. 14); however the superconducting transition in elemental sulfur occurs at significantly lower temperatures . Another expected product of decomposition of H 2 S is hydrogen. However, the strong characteristic vibrational stretching mode from the H 2 molecule was never observed in our Raman spectra (nor was it observed in ref. 14). Therefore we suppose that the dissociation of H 2 S is different and involves the creation of higher hydrides, such as 3H 2 S R H 6 S 1 2S or 2H 2 S R H 4 S 1 S. It is natural to expect these reactions, as sulfur can be not only divalent, but also exhibits higher valencies. In fact, calculations indirectly support this hypothesis, as the dissoci- ation H 2 S R H 2 1 S was shown to be energetically very unfavourable. We found further theoretical support in ref. . In that work, the van der Waals compound 21 (H 2 S) 2 H 2 was considered, and it was shown that at pressures above 180 GPa it forms an Im-3m structure with H 3 S stoichiometry. The predicted T c < 190 K and its pressure dependences are close to our experimental values ). Our hypothesis of the transformation of H 2 S to higher hydrides (in the H 3 S stoichiometry each S atom is surrounded by 6 hydrogen atoms) is strongly supported by further calculations . All the numerous works based on the Im-3m structure are consistent in their prediction of T c .,200 K, which decreases with pressure. The hydrogen sublattice gives the main contribution to superconductivity . Inclusion of zero point vibra- tions and anharmonicity in the calculations corrected the calculated T c to ,190 K, and the isotope coefficient from a 5 0.5 to a 5 0.35- both in agreement with the present work.","1"
"562","Drozdov_etal_2015","10","The highest T c of 203 K that we report here has been achieved most probably in H 3 S having the Im-3m structure. It is a good metal; inter- estingly, there is also strong covalent bonding between H and S atoms in this compound . This is in agreement with the general assumption (see for instance ref. ) that a metal with high T c should have strong covalent bonding (as is realized in MgB 2 ; ref. ) together with high- frequency modes in the phonon spectrum. This particular combination of bonding type and phonon spectrum would probably provide a good criterion when searching for the materials with high T c at ambient pressure that are required for applications. There are many hydro- gen-containing materials with strong covalent bonding (such as organ- ics) but typically they are insulators. In principle, they could be tuned to a metallic state by doping or gating. Modern methods of structure prediction could facilitate exploration for the desired materials.","1"

For electrical measurements we used diamond anvil cells (DACs) with anvils of the following shape: tip diameter of 200-300 mm bevelled at 7-8u to a culet of 40-80 mm. An insulating gasket is required to separate the metallic gasket from the electrodes. It was prepared in the following way (Extended . First a metallic gasket of T301 stainless steel (or Re) 250 mm thick was indented with about 17-20 GPa pressure. Then the bottom of the imprint of diameter ,200 mm was drilled out, and a powder insulating material was put in the imprint and pressed between the anvils to form a layer. The insulating layer was made of either Teflon, NaCl or CaSO 4 as these materials do not react with H 2 S. The layer was pressed to obtain a thickness in the centre of ,3-5 mm to provide stable clamping. A larger thickness leads to instability in the sample-it shifts or escapes under pressure-while with a thinner gasket it is difficult to reach high pressures. A hole of diameter ,10-30 mm was then drilled in the insulating layer. Four Ti electrodes were sputtered on the diamond anvil. The electrodes were capped with Au to prevent oxidation of the Ti. (To check a possible contribution of the diamond surface to the conductivity, we prepared a different configuration of electrodes for a once-only experiment: two electrodes were sput- tered on one anvil and another two on another anvil, similar to ref. . After preparation of the electrodes the gasket was put back on the anvil and the DAC was assembled so that the separation between the anvils was about 20-100 mm (mea- sured by interference fringes). The DAC was placed into a cryostat and cooled down to ,200 K (within the temperature range of liquid H 2 S) and then H 2 S gas was put through a capillary into a rim around the diamond anvil where it liquefied (Extended Data ). H 2 S of 99.5% and D 2 S of 97% purity were been used. The filling was monitored visually (Extended Data Figs 4, 5) and the sample was identified by measuring Raman spectra. Then liquid H 2 S was clamped in the gasket hole by pushing the piston of the DAC with the aid of screws outside the cryostat. The thickness of the sample can be estimated to be few micrometres, as measured from interference spectra through the clamped transparent sample. The thickness might be ,1 mm if the sample expanded over the culet . After the clamping, the DAC was heated to ,220 K to evaporate the rest of the H 2 S, and then the pressure was further increased at this temperature. The pressure remained stable during the cooling within 65 GPa. The pressure was determined by a diamond edge scale at room temperature and low temperatures 32 . For optical measurements a Raman spectrometer was equipped with a nitrogen-cooled CCD and notch filters. The 632.8 nm line of a He-Ne laser was used to excite the Raman spectra and to determine pressure.","0"

The magnetization curves show hysteresis, indicating a type II superconductor. The magnetization curves are however distorted by obvious paramagnetic input (which is also observed in other superconductors ). In our case, the paramagnetic signal is probably from the DAC, but further study of the origin of this input is required. The paramagnetic background increases when temperature is decreased. The minima of the magnetization curves (,35 mT) are the result of the diamagnetic input from superconductivity and the paramagnetic background. The first critical field H c1 < 30 mT can be roughly estimated as the point where magnetization deviates from linear behaviour. At higher fields, magnetization increases due to the penetration of magnetic vortexes. As the sign of the field change reverses, the magnetic flux in the Shubnikov phase remains trapped and therefore the back run (that is, with decreasing field) is irreversible-the returning branch of the magnetic cycle (shown by filled points) runs above the direct one.

"584","L088227002-CC","2","The predominantly d x 2 2y 2 pairing symmetry , the existence of spin fluctuations in the CuO 2 planes , and the pseudogap phenomena in the underdoped and optimally p-type cuprates have been widely con- ceived as essential to high-temperature superconductivity. However, recent scanning tunneling spectroscopic studies have shown that the pairing symmetry may be dependent on the hole-doping concentration, with ͑d x 2 2y 2 1 s͒ mixed symmetries in certain overdoped cuprates such as ͑Y 12x Ca x ͒Ba 2 Cu 3 O 72d . Furthermore, whether the pairing symmetry is d x 2 2y 2 or s wave in the one- layer n-type cuprates such as Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d and Pr 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d remains controversial , and it has been suggested that the pairing symmetry in the one-layer n-type cuprates may change from d x 2 2y 2 to s, depending on the electron doping level . The nonuniversal pairing symmetries in cuprate superconductors imply that the sym- metry is likely the result of competing orders rather than a sufficient condition for pairing. Nonetheless, an important consequence of either d x 2 2y 2 or ͑d x 2 2y 2 1 s͒-wave pairing is that the resulting nodal quasiparticles can interact strongly with the quantum impurities in the CuO 2 planes , such that a small concentration of impurities can give rise to strong suppression of superconductivity and modification of the collective Cu 21 spin excitations . In addition, Kondo effects could be induced by nonmagnetic impurities through breaking the nearest- neighbor antiferromagnetic Cu 21 -Cu 21 interaction . Such strong response to nonmagnetic impurities is in sharp contrast to conventional s-wave superconductivity . Despite significant progress in the studies of cuprate superconductivity, the research on the simplest form of cuprates, the infinite-layer system Sr 12x L x CuO 2 (L La, Gd, Sm), has been limited due to the difficulties in making single-phase samples with complete superconduct- ing volume. Recently, Jung et al. have demonstrated single-phase samples of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 with nearly 100% superconducting volume and a sharp superconducting tran- sition temperature at T c 43 K, thus enabling reliable spectroscopic studies of the pairing symmetry and the ef- fects of quantum impurities. These single-phased infinite- layer cuprates are n-type with P4͞mmm symmetry, which differ significantly from other cuprates in that no excess charge reservoir block exists between consecutive CuO 2 planes except a single layer of Sr(La), as illustrated in , suggesting stronger CuO 2 interplanar coupling. Furthermore, the c-axis superconducting coherence length ͑j c 0.53 nm͒ is found to be longer than the c-axis lattice constant ͑c 0 0.347 nm͒ , in stark contrast to other cuprate superconductors with j c ø c 0 . Hence, the super- conducting properties of the infinite-layer system are ex- pected to be more three-dimensional, as opposed to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of all other cuprates. In this Letter, we report experimental findings based on the scan- ning tunneling spectroscopy studies of pure infinite-layer samples and those with a small concentration (1%) of ei- ther magnetic or nonmagnetic quantum impurities. A num- ber of surprising results are found and compared with the established phenomena in other cuprates.","1"

The spectral weight of SLCO for quasiparticle energies at jEj $ D was smaller than the BCS prediction, whereas additional DOS appeared for jEj , D and the DOS ap- proached 0 at the Fermi level (i.e., V 0). Such behavior cannot be accounted for by the simple inclusion of disorder in the BCS weak-coupling limit, because the latter would have only broadened the width of the conductance peaks and also increased the DOS near V 0 substantially. The spectra also differed fundamentally from those of pure d x 2 2y 2 -wave cuprates because of the lack of discernible gap variations and of the absence of ZBCP in all spectra taken on random grain orientations.

First, Na 0.7 CoO 2 polycrystals were synthesized by three rounds of fast solid-state reaction at 1083 K in flowing oxygen with two intermediate regrind- ings, using Na 2 CO 3 (99.9%) and Co 3 O 4 (99.99%) as the starting materials. Although the original composition is Na 0.74 CoO 2 , the actual composition was determined to be Na 0.7 CoO 2 by the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and the Na + ion-selective electrode (ISE) techniques.

"606","SSC1310125-CC","6","In the second step, Na 0.7 CoO 2 was oxidized by the excessive bromine dissolved in acetonitrile. This process resulted in the deintercalation of the sodium, pro- ducing the thermodynamically metastable hexagonal phase Na x CoO 2 (0.25 < x < 0.7). The value of x depends on the equilibrium concentrations of Br 2 , Br − , and Na + , provided the reaction time is long enough (over 48 hours for polycrystalline samples). In the case of the sample preparation in the present study, 2.140 g Na 0.7 CoO 2 reacted with 3.70 g Br 2 dissolved in 10.0 ml acetoni- trile in a closed container at 310 K for 48 hours. After the reaction completed, the solid product was washed several times with acetonitrile and then dried in vacuum. The mass of the solid Na x CoO 2 became 1.965 g.

The shrinkage of a-axis is ascribed to the increase of the oxidation state of cobalt, and the stretch of c-axis is due to the relatively weak Coulomb attractions along the c-axis when Na + is partially deintercalated.","0"
"607","SSC1310125-CC","7","The intermediate compound Na 0.32 CoO 2 easily absorbs water. So, most liter- atures employed the reaction with water vapor for the hydration. However, deliquescence often happens, making it difficult to distinguish between crys- tal water and free water. Now that free water inclusion is inevitable, one can prepare the hydrated compound by the direct reaction with water liquid or solution, and it was proved to be successful . In this study, we employed both routes to synthesize the hydrated compound in order to make a compar- ison. Partial Na 0.32 CoO 2 sample reacted with water vapor at room temper- ature for one week, obtaining the water-vapor-hydrated (WVH) compound. Another part of Na 0.32 CoO 2 was soaked with water liquid in a closed container at room temperature for one week. This product is hereafter called water- liquid-hydrated (WLH) sample.

XRD measurement for the sample annealed at 673 K in air shows that Co 3 O 4 is separated out, like the case in . So, the loss of weight at ∼ 605 K corresponds to the following equation, Since Co 3 O 4 decomposes at about 1180 K in air, the weight-loss at 1184 K is ascribed to the decomposition of Co 3 O 4 , It is noted that the theoretical weight-losses based on Eqs.

This value is obviously lower than the common value ∼ 1.3 . On the contrary, the water content for the WVH compound is determined as 2.3, which is remarkably higher than that of previous reports. We suspect that free water had been absorbed in the WVH sample. It is noted that the ratio of weight-loss at 1184 K and 1291 K is quite different for the two hydrated samples. This is because that the sodium content in the WLH compound is lower than that in the WVH sample.","0"

In the ISE measurement, the sample was dissolved in acid solution, and then the solution was neutralized by (CH 3 ) 2 CHNH 2 to eliminate the disturbance of H 3 O + .

"613","SSC1310125-CC","13","We also used the ISE technique to determine the Na + concentration dynam- ically. shows the change of Na + concentration against the time of the hydration reaction at 300 K. It can be seen that the liberated Na + increases with increasing the reaction time. During the first 10 hours of the hydration, Na + concentration increases rapidly. Then, it increases gradually until the sat- uration at 0.01 mol/L when t=120 hours. It was also noted that the pH value increases from 9.0 at the beginning of the hydration to 12.0 when the reaction completed. That is to say, NaOH is gradually liberated during the hydration reaction. Considered that the hydration is not a redox reaction, therefore, H + has to be incorporated in the hydrated product. By using the above TGA re- sult, the WLH compound can be expressed as Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O, and the hydration can be described as Apparently, the equation above consists of the ion-exchange of Na + and H + . So, it is not strange that the content of the incorporated proton was found to alter with the change of the concentration of NaOH in the reactor. When the NaOH was removed, the content of the incorporated proton could increase up to 0.15. On the contrary, in the case of high NaOH concentration, the amount of the incorporated H + will be reduced. Note that free water may exist in the WVH sample, we speculate that small amount of proton might be also incorporated in the Na 0.32 CoO 2 • 2.3H 2 O phase.","0"
"614","SSC1310125-CC","14","Now, let us discuss the possible crystal structure of Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O. As we know, the anhydrus parent compound Na 0.32 CoO 2 consists of triangular CoO 2 layers in which cobalt is octahedrally coordinated. Partially-occupied Na + is sandwiched by the CoO 2 layers. Water can be intercalated between CoO 2 layers and Na + layers when the sodium is deintercalated to some ex- tent. By using neutron diffractions, detailed structural models were estab- lished . Impressively, Jorgensen et. al. proposed that the position of Na + was shifted in such a way to accommodate the tetrahedral coordina- tions by water molecules. In this model, the ideal Na to H 2 O ratio is 1:4, which also satisfies the chemical formula Na0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O.","0"
"615","SSC1310125-CC","15","So, we think that similar structure is probable for the present WLH compound. Another problem concerns about the position of the incorporated H + . From chemical bonding point of view, H + may bond with the oxygen in H 2 O to form H 3 O + , or, bond with the oxygen in CoO 2 layers to form the OH groups. We have measured the IR spectra, but no definite conclusion can be drawn about the bonding of the H + . The longer c-axis of Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 •0.85H 2 O compared with that of Na 0.32 CoO 2 • 2.3H 2 O can be explained in terms of Coulomb attractions between the Na + layers and CoO 2 layers. One would expect that relatively weak Coulomb at- tractions along the c-axis for Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O due to the relatively less electric charge in the Na + and CoO 2 layers. So, though the water content is not high in Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O, the c-axis parameter can be even larger than that of Na 0.32 CoO 2 • 2.3H 2 O.","0"

The resistance measurement shown in the inset of confirms the result in an opposite way. The fresh pellet shows no superconducting transi- tion above 1.9 K, however, after the very same sample was placed in humid environment at room temperature over a period of time, superconductivity was recovered. Moreover, T c increases with increasing the placement time. Therefore, it should be careful to draw any conclusions on the relationship between T c and the factors, such as water and sodium content. We checked the XRD patterns for the as-pressed and the as-placed pellets. Both data in- dicates single phase of c=19.7Å , however, the as-pressed sample shows very broad diffraction peaks, and the broad peaks change back into sharp ones for the as-placed sample.

The Ca-intercalated graphite, CaC 6 , with its ""record"" T c of about 11.5 K, in particular, has been the subject of various theoretical and experimental in- vestigations in the past two years (for a short review of the initial results see ). One of the most important questions, however, is still not clear: what is the mag- nitude and anisotropy of its superconducting gap? The first experiments (STM, penetration depth, specific heat) on CaC 6 have evidenced a single, apparently isotropic, s- wave gap with a ratio 2∆/k B T c of the order of the BCS value . Recent tunnel spectroscopy results, on the other hand, claimed the presence of an isotropic gap with a magnitude more than 40% higher than that reported earlier . The spread of gap values measured up to now range between 1.6 meV and 2.3 meV . The im- portant point is that all these experiments have either probed a bulk property or a directional one along the c-axis direction . As pointed out in Ref., the presence of anisotropic or two-gap superconductivity in CaC 6 cannot be ruled out until tunneling or point- contact measurements are performed also along the ab direction. On the other hand, recent first-principles den- sity functional calculations of the superconducting prop- erties of CaC 6 have supported the presence of a moder- ately anisotropic gap which varies between 1.1 and 2.3 meV, depending on the k-point and the π or interlayer (IL) sheet of the Fermi surface (FS) involved . Such an anisotropy can be revealed by directional spectroscopy measurements performed along both c and ab direction.","1"

The conductance curves, dI/dV vs. V , were obtained by numerical differentiation of the measured I −V curves and subsequently normalized by dividing them by the normal-state conductance measured at T ≥ T c . For this reason, in all the contacts, we therefore carefully studied the temperature dependence of the conductance in order to determine the critical temperature of the junction, i.e. the 'Andreev critical temperature', T A c . In an overall of 35 different contacts, T A c was found to be 11.3 ± 0.1 K, in best agreement with the bulk T c 's of the samples and in contrast with a previous report .

The condition for full ballistic transport (a ≪ ℓ) is totally verified in ab-plane contacts, where a ab ≈ 6 − 18 nm.

Although this broadening washes out the fine anisotropic structures of the conduc- tance, a clear sign of the underlying gap anisotropy is still present since the 3D BTK fit of the theoretical con- ductances gives different order parameters in the two di- rections, ∆ = 1.5 meV (Γ = 0.65 meV, Z = 0.765) for a-axis direction and ∆ = 1.7 meV (Γ = 0.92 meV, Z = 1.015) for c-axis one. The c-axis value is in perfect agree- ment with the experimental results (both single curves at 400 mK and the peak of the distribution of the 14 dif- ferent contacts). In the ab-plane case, the experimental ∆ values from the curves at 400 mK and from the peak of the distribution of (a) (ranging from 1.3 meV to 1.44 meV) are smaller than the value obtained from the fit of the theoretical conductance. This discrepancy could be ascribed to a possible slight overestimation of the small π gap (and, maybe, an underestimation of the large IL gap associated with Ca FS) in the theoretical calculations. This fact appears reasonable if one consid- ers that the first-principle calculations of Ref. led to an underestimation of T c of about 17 %.","0"

Finally, the superconductivity is suppressed completely at a critical pressure near 7 GPa and 6 GPa for A = Rb and K and probably above 10 GPa for A = Cs. Characteristic changes in the coefficient A of the T 2 term in resistivity and residual resistivity are observed, both of which are synchronized with the corresponding change in T c .

Very recent µSR [5] and NMR [6] experiments revealed that unconventional superconductivity is realized, particularly in KOs 2 O 6 with the highest T c . In contrast, there are a few reports insisting on conventional BCS-type superconductivity in RbOs 2 O 6 .","1"

"650","L095167004-CC","4","The superconducting transition temperature of the β-pyrochlore oxides increases with decreasing the ionic radius of A-site alkali metals from Cs to K. Accordingly, the lattice volume is decreased by the negative chemical pressure. This fact implies that the reduction of the lattice volume by applying physical pressure would further enhance T c . This expectation was confirmed actually in previous two high-pressure (HP) experiments by measuring magnetization up to 1.2 GPa for all the members [11] and up to 0.8 GPa for RbOs 2 O 6 [7]. Another interesting finding in the former study is that only in the case of KOs 2 O 6 the T c exhibits a saturation around 0.6 GPa and then decreases slightly with pressure, suggesting complicated pressure dependences at higher pressures. Thus, it is important to investigate the pressure dependence of T c and other properties in a wider pressure range. It is also intriguing to search for another ground state which would exist next to the superconducting state under very high pressure, as often found in other unconventional superconductors [12]. In this Letter, we report on resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 10 GPa on all the three members of the β-pyrochlore oxide superconductors. A characteristic pressure-temperature phase diagram has been obtained, where in general the T c exhibits a dome-shaped change as a function of pressure.","0"
"651","L095167004-CC","5","Polycrystalline samples of AOs 2 O 6 were prepared as reported previously [1-3]. For CsOs 2 O 6 and RbOs 2 O 6 , they were nearly single-phase including a small amount of Os metal. For KOs 2 O 6 , 10 mol% of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 was contained as another phase, which was necessary to obtain a sufficiently hard pellet for resistivity measurements. The coexistence of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 may not affect the determination of T c , because it becomes insulating below 230 K . Electrical resistivity measurements were performed by the four-probe method in a cubic-anvil press apparatus [14] at high pressures from 2 GPa to 10 GPa and temperatures from 3 K to 300 K. A fluorinert liquid, which is a one-to-one mixture of FC-70 and FC-77 (3M TM ), was used as a pressure transmitting medium. A polycrystalline pellet of a typical size of 0.8 × 0.3 × 0.4 mm 3 was immersed into the fluorinert liquid in a cylindrical teflon capsule of 1.5 φ × 1.8 mm 3 size. Then, the capsule was put into a cubic pyrophillite block of 6.0 mm edge and compressed almost isostatically by using six anvils made of tungsten carbide. The whole of the sample cell and the press was placed in a liquid-helium dewar to cool down to 3 K. Each run of resistivity T 2 , as shown in the inset to Fig.3(a) for RbOs 2 O 6 , to determine A and ρ 0 . The slope of the T 2 term in RbOs 2 O 6 is large at 2 GPa and does not change much up to 3 GPa near the T c maximum. Then it decreases very much from 4 GPa to 7 GPa, where T c decreases and finally disappears, and then increases again at 8 GPa and 10 GPa. The origin of an upturn observed at low temperatures above 7 GPa is not known and it is ignored in evaluating A and ρ 0 . Such an upturn was not detected in our recent experiment using a better quality of sample. The same analysis has been carried out for CsOs 2 O 6 . The resulting pressure dependences of A and ρ 0 are summarized in Fig. 4. In order to deduce a general trend, each quantity has been normalized by the value at the maximum of the T c dome. Pressure is also normalized as P n = ( P -P* ) / ( P c -P* ), where P* is a pressure at the T c maximum and P c is a critical pressure where superconductivity disappears; that is, P n = 0 for P = P* and P n = 1 for P = P c . For KOs 2 O 6 , only T c is plotted, because we could not obtain reliable data due to the presence of impurities. It becomes apparent now that normalized T c falls on a universal curve. Either normalized A and ρ 0 is connected smoothly between RbOs 2 O 6 and CsOs 2 O 6 to show a general curve: Normalized A exhibits a broad maximum near the T c maximum and a minimum near P c , while normalized ρ 0 shows a minimum near P* and a maximum near P c . In the framework of Fermi liquid theory, A is proportional to square of effective mass of carriers or density of states at the Fermi level. Thus, the above results on A imply that the carrier mass is enhanced significantly at the T c maximum owing to correlation effects. This strongly suggests that the mechanism of superconductivity in the β-pyrochlore 4 oxides is relevant to electron correlations. On the other hand, residual resistivity is generally expressed by the equation ρ 0 = ( ħ / e 2 l ) ( 3 π 2 ) 1/3 n -2/3 , where l is the mean free path of carriers and n is carrier density. The mean free path at low temperature may be determined by the concentration of impurities or defects and thus should not be affected by pressure. It is expected, however, that the mean free path would be reduced largely by quantum fluctuations developing toward absolute zero, which often exist near a quantum critical point associated with a certain long-range order such as a magnetic transition or valence transition [16,17]. The observed enhancement in ρ 0 near P c may indicate that there is an unknown long-range order at higher pressure. Possibly, the sudden recovery of metallic behavior observed below 100 K at 10 GPa in RbOs 2 O 6 (Fig.3(b) is related to this long range order. It is plausible that the associated quantum fluctuations would suppress the superconductivity, giving rise to a dome-shaped T c variation. The observed dome-shaped change in T c and the corresponding unusual variations in A and ρ 0 must reflect unconventional features of superconductivity in the β-pyrochlore oxides. However, it seems that they are quite different from those observed in well-known unconventional superconductors, such as f-electron intermetallic compounds or low-dimensional organic conductors [12,18]. A typical f-electron compound CeCu 2 Ge 2 exhibits a large reduction in A and a sharp peak in ρ 0 at the T c maximum, which is believed to be induced by valence fluctuations [12,16,17]. In the present β-pyrochlores osmium ions are formally in a 5.5 valent state with two and a half 5d electrons. It is interesting to note that this number of 5d electrons is just between two integer values for Re 5+ ions (5d 2 ) in 1 K superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 and Os 5+ ions (5d 3 ) in Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 exhibiting a metal-to-insulator transition [13, 19]. However, we think that valence fluctuations may not play a primary role in the β-pyrochlores, because the band width of Os 5d -O 2p hybridized bands is large, ~3 eV, from the band structure calculations [20-22]. The most plausible scenario for quantum fluctuations is to assume electronic instability associated with Fermi surface nesting. Harima has pointed out that an important general feature on the band structure of the β-pyrochlores is the existence of a pair of Fermi surfaces of nearly octahedral shape which forms a thin shell centered at the Γ point. Thus, strong Fermi surface nesting and resulting spin-density-wave instability are expected. Moreover, a 'dimple' grows on the octahedral Fermi surface from K to Cs, suggesting that the nesting becomes weaker along this line. It would be interesting to test how this feature changes under high pressure. In order to clarify the existence of possible quantum fluctuations in the β-pyrochlore oxides and their relevance to the superconductivity, further experiments are required under high pressures. In summary, we have obtained interesting and characteristic behavior in the pressure dependence of T c and other parameters in the β-pyrochlore oxides AOs 2 O 6 by measuring resistivity under high pressure up to 10 GPa. Generally, the T c shows a dome-like shape as a function of pressure. The variations of the coefficient A of the T 2 term and the residual resistivity ρ 0 are also anomalous and synchronized with the change in T c . These results suggest that electron correlations enhance the superconductivity, while certain quantum fluctuations give rise to the degradation of T c at higher pressure.","1"

However, the positions of the maximum are quite different among them: (P*/GPa, T c */K) = (6.0, 7.6), (2.0, 8.2) and (0.6, 10) for Cs, Rb and K, respectively. Critical pressures P c , where superconductivity is suppressed, are also different; P c ~ 6 and 7 GPa for K and Rb, and more than 10 GPa for Cs. These differences in P* and P c must come from differences in the lattice constant and its compressibility under high pressure.

Further, measurements  in magnetic fields above H c2 = 4.95 T (H||c) reveal an evolution from NFL to FL behavior and a universal scaling of the Sommerfeld coefficient, leading to the conclusion that long-range AFM order was narrowly avoided at a quantum critical point H QCP = 5 T.

As shown in , when superconductivity is suppressed, the NFL behavior persists to the lowest temperature indicating that superconductivity develops out of a NFL ground state. It is interesting to note that the superconducting transition is always second-order (x > 0). No evidence of magnetic order is observed in these C(H, T ) [or ρ(H, T )] measurements.

Two additional parameters are needed for comparison to experiment. The first parameter T 0 , is related to the exchange energy by T 0 = J /(2π 2 ), which we take to be close to that of the Néel temperature T N ≈ 4 K of the homologous compound CeRhIn 5 , and the second is the contribution to the electronic specific heat of non-critical fermions γ 0 of the order of the Sommerfeld coefficient at T c .

In particular, we do not observe the robust Fermi-liquid behavior near H c2 that would be expected if the QCP was suppressed more rapidly than superconductivity. Moreover, no sign of an anomaly associated with magnetic order is found at T = 60 mK in the magnetoresistance (Fig. 3a) [or C(H, T )]; such an anomaly is expected to occur if superconductivity was suppressed more rapidly than the critical point. Thus, to within the width of the superconducting transition (∼ 0.5 T), no long-range order is observed for T > ∼ 50 mK and for H ≤ 9 T (x ≤ 0.12). The absence of FL behavior at H c2 and long-range order provide further evidence for the occurrence of a QCP at H c2 for all x. The C(H, T ) data reveal a crossover from NFL to FL behavior where the slope of the −ln(T ) dependence of C el /T decreases but does not saturate; only for H ≥ 7.5 T does C el /T become constant, indicative of a FL ground state.

We discuss two possible scenarios consistent with this novel type of quantum criticality. An attractive scenario consistent with our data is that of a superconducting quantum critical point. It has recently been shown that quantum criticality can arise in a conventional BCS superconductor when pair breaking suppresses T c to zero temperature . In this case, the superconducting pair fluctuations are characterized by a dynamical critical exponent z = 2, leading to singular corrections to the specific heat δC/T ∼ −ln(T /T 0 ) and electrical resistivity δρ ∼ AT in two dimensions. Similar predictions for a superconducting quan- tum critical point developing from unconventional d-wave superconductivity are lacking at present, making direct comparison to experiment impossible.

It shows very good agree- ment with specific heat measurements under pressure. Although a jump in specific heat at T c (∆C/γ(T c ) ∼ 5) has a surprisingly large value at ambient pressure, in- dicative of a strong coupling superconductivity, this value shows a marked decrease against applying pressure . Correspondingly, 1/T 1 T is significantly suppressed as pressure increases . Both results suggest that the application of pressure to CeCoIn 5 increases the heavy- fermion bandwidth due to the increase of hybridization between f electrons and conduction electrons and even- tually brings the system away from the antiferromagnetic QCP. As a result, the superconducting gap or ∆ 0 /k B T c in CeCoIn 5 decreases as shown in in- set. Noting that, in CeCoIn 5 , the 1/T 1 T is intimately enhanced upon cooling to T c , it is expected that antifer- romagnetic spin fluctuations play a role in mediating the Cooper pairs even when the system is away from the an- tiferromagnetic QCP under pressure. Nevertheless, the enhancement of T c with applying pressure was sug- gested to be relevant to the increase in heavy-fermion bandwidth that is expected to make the lifetime of quasi- particles long enough. In this context, the Cooper pairs in CeCoIn 5 may originate from attractive interaction in- duced by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. It was hence argued that, in the presence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, the value of T c may be controlled by the combined effect of coupling strength for the Cooper-pair formation due to the closeness to the antiferromagnetic QCP and the heavy-fermion bandwidth in CeCoIn 5.","0"

Our re- sults indicate that another superconducting phase exists in the absence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, in addition to the superconducting phase with T max c = 1 K that coexists with antiferromagnetism. The present sys- tem bears some similarity with another proto-type heavy fermion compound CeCu 2 Si 2, and suggests that the exis- tence of multiple superconducting phase may be common in heavy fermion compounds.","1"

In addition it is also very sensitive to the value of the superconducting fraction, which was fixed from heat capacity measurements.

In this paper, we have taken an alternative approach to examining this issue, and carried out systematic doping studies at different sites for the Zr 5 Ge 3 system. Chemical doping effects and structural instabilities caused by doping have been considered and tested for our doping studies in the Zr 5 Ge 3 system.

One can clearly see that superconductivity is only observed in the Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5 sample, and the other samples with the same doping level remain as poor metals in the measured temperature range above 1.9 K. The decreased residual-resistance ratio (RRR) in all the doped samples is expected from the enhanced scattering at low temperature caused by chemical doping. It is worthwhile to note that sometimes a small drop of resistivity is observed in the Ir- containing samples, which is attributed to small impurities of the superconducting Zr-Ir alloy that is not detectable from XRD, but is evidenced from later SEM analysis. Apparently, the Pt element, similar to Ru, is critical for the induced superconductivity in the Zr 5 Ge 3 system. Similarly, the induced superconductivity through Pt doping is also found to be site-selective. As shown in (b), with the same amount of Pt doping, only the Ge site doped sample Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5 is superconducting at 2.8 K, and the samples doped at the Zr site Zr 4.5 Pt 0.5 Ge 3 and at the octahedral interstitial site Zr 5 Ge 3 Pt 0.5 are found to be non-super- conducting at our lowest measured temperature.

The local quasi-particle density of states (DOS) equals the normal-state DOS at the vortex core, but is broadened near the vortex due to the pair- breaking effect of the local magnetic field (as described by the Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory developed further by Maki, de Gennes and others ). In the limit of moderate fields (H << H c2 ), Caroli, de Gennes and Matricon have shown that the main contribution to the density of states at the Fermi energy comes from the low lying states local- ized in a vortex core. Each isolated vortex gives a contri- bution equivalent to a normal region of radius ξ yielding for the density of states at the Fermi level ρ(0) ∝ ρ n (0)ξ 2 , where ρ n (0) is the normal state DOS at the Fermi level.

One of the exper- imental facts taken as evidence for such deviations is the opening of a pseudogap (PG) above T c , a phe- nomenon of loss of density of states (DOS) . The pseudogap is pronounced at low doping level, in the so-called underdoped regime. The pseudogap temper- ature, T * , generally decreases as the carrier doping rate increases. However, it is unclear whether T * finally merges into the T c curve in the overdoped regime , or it terminates before superconductivity disappears . Different classes of theories have been put forward to explain the pseudogap phenomenon (for examples, see Ref.). It is interesting that these theories generally also propose different mechanisms for the occurrence of superconductivity. Since the topology of the phase diagram has great impact on the mechanism of the high-T c superconductivity, it is important to clarify the doping dependence of the pseudogap. Unfortunately, the onset of superconductivity, typically at ∼100 K, and the large upper critical field H c2 (∼ 100 T) prevents in- vestigation of how the pseudogap evolves with doping. The highest static field available to date (∼ 30 T) was only able to reduce T c to half its value at most .

In most high-T c cuprates, the dynamical suscep- tibility has a peak at the antiferromagnetic wave vector Q=(π,π). 1/T 1 T is then shown to be proportional to χ Q . The increase of 1/T 1 T upon decreasing temperature is generally attributed to the increase of χ Q , namely, to the development of antiferromagnetic correlations. For antiferromagnetically correlated metals, this quantity fol- lows a Curie-Weiss relation , χ Q ∝ 1/(T + θ), so that 1/T 1 T ∼ 1/(T + θ) before superconductivity sets in.

This suggests that superconductivity and pseudo- gap are coexisting matters. Below T * , some parts of the Fermi surface are lost due to the onset of the pseudogap, but other parts of the Fermi surface remain ungapped.

The existence of a critical carrier concentration for the pseudogap, the lack of scaling or correlation between T c and T * , and the persistence of the pseudogap when superconductivity is removed seem not to favor super- conducting precursor as a candidate responsible for the pseudogap which was proposed theoretically by several authors.","0"

The structure is composed of thick insulating layers of Na atoms and H 2 O molecules, as well as conducting CoO 2 layers. In the CoO 2 layer, CoO 6 octahedra are connected to each other by edge sharing with the Co sites forming a triangular lattice. On the other hand, the valence of the Co ion is between 3+ (3d 6 ) and 4+ (3d 5 ) as in the case of Na 0.5 CoO 2. Co 3+ and Co 4+ ions often have low spin states with S=0 and 1/2, respectively. At the early stage of research, this compound was considered as a system of S=1/2 triangular lattice doped with electrons and the doped resonating- valence-bond (RVB) model was expected to be valid for explaining its superconductivity. Now, it is widely recognized that the electron density of this compound is so large that the doped RVB model can not be applied simply.

"850","L091217001-CC","5","Theoretically, various possibilities have been proposed on the superconducting sym- metry of the compound (or more generally, for the triangular lattice system), for example, d-, chiral d-, chiral p-, and f -waves. These states can be distinguished from each other by microscopic experiments such as nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR), muon spin ro- tation/relaxation (µSR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In the NQR measure- ments, no Hebel-Schlichter peak (coherence peak) was observed in a 1/ 59 T 1 T -T curve (T 1 : relaxation time, and T : temperature), which means that the superconducting gap has nodes on the Fermi surface. Thus, the symmetry of s-, chiral d-, and chiral p-waves are denied. It was pointed out previously for the case of chiral d-or chiral p-wave that if superconductivity is disturbed by impurities, the coherence peak is reduced and may not be observed. However, an internal magnetic field should exist if chiral d or chiral p is the case, and it has never observed by µSR. These results are consistent with specific heat data, which suggest the presence of line-nodes in the superconducting gap. Therefore, the superconducting symmetry is limited to d-or f -wave. The d-and f -wave symmetries can be distinguished from T -dependence of Knight shift, K; sudden change of K below T c is expected for spin singlet Cooper pairs with the d-wave symmetry, while invariable K below T c along a certain direction for spin triplet pairing with the f -wave symmetry.","0"

Superconductivity shows up only when a minute amount (∆y ≈ 0.02) of interstitial oxy- gens are removed by the reducing procedure . The role of the tiny amount of interstitial oxygen is not clear up to now.

The n-type infinite-layer superconductors (ILS) have several merits. First, the simplest crystal structure among all HTS consisting of an infinite stacking of CuO 2 planes and (Sr, Ln) layers. The charge reservoir block commonly present in cuprates does not exist in the infinite-layer structure. Second, the stoi-chiometric oxygen content without vacancies or intersti- tial oxygen . Third, n-type ILS have much higher T c ≃ 43 K compared to the n-type cuprates with T ′ -structure T c ≃ 25 K. Although n-type ILS have existed for quite a while, not many studies of their physical properties were performed because of the lack of high-quality sam- ples with a complete superconducting volume.

A detailed discussion of the TF-µSR technique is given in where details of the application of the technique to the determination of λ can be found. shows TF-µSR muon-spin precession signals in an applied field of 600 mT above and below T c . For vi- sualization purposes the apparent precession frequencies are modified from the actual precession frequencies by the use of a rotating reference frame. In the normal state above T c , the oscillation shows a small relaxation due to random local fields from nuclear magnetic moments. Below T c , the relaxation rate strongly increases due to the inhomogeneous field distribution of the flux line lat- tice. It is well known that in n-type cuprates there is a competition between the antiferromagnetically ordered state and superconductivity . The static magnetism, if present, could enhance the muon depolarization rate and falsify the interpretation of the TF-µSR results. We have therefore carried out zero-field (ZF) µSR experi- ments to determine whether such static magnetism exists in SLCO. Typical ZF-µSR spectra are shown in for temperatures above and below T c . The ZF relaxation is exponential with a small relaxation rate 0.149(4) µs −1 and 0.184(5) µs −1 at 50 and 2.5 K, respectively. Thus, there is no evidence for the static magnetism in SLCO down to 2.5 K. Moreover, the ZF relaxation rate is small and changes very little between 50 and 2.5 K. Therefore, the increase in TF relaxation rate below T c is attributed entirely to the vortex lattice.","1"

We used two Gaussian model for analyzing our asymmetry time spectra: where A i represent the asymmetries of the two compo- nents, σ i the muon depolarization rates, B i the local magnetic fields at the muon sites, γ=135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio and ϕ the initial phase. The solid lines in show the best fits to Eq. (1). The fit is statistically satisfactory (χ 2 criterion), as can be seen qualitatively in . Analysis of the asymmetry time spectra showed that below T c in the present SLCO sample more than 80 % of the muons stop in the superconducting regions (first component). In this regions the internal magnetic field is smaller than the external one because of the diamag- netic screening and the depolarization rate is much higher than in the normal state because of the flux-line lattice formation. The rest 20 % of the muons (second com- ponent) oscillate with a frequency nearly equal to that corresponding to the applied magnetic field with a much smaller depolarization rate. This signal is most probably coming from the muons stopping in the nonsupercon- ducting grain boundaries and other defects in the struc- ture and is often observed in polycrystalline HTS .

Each point was obtained by field-cooling the sample from above T c to 10 K. The inset of shows that σ strongly increases with increasing magnetic field up to B ext ≃50 mT and above 50 mT changes very little with magnetic field. Such a behavior is expected within the London model and is typical for polycrystalline HTS . It can be seen that above 50 mT σ(B) shows a ten- dency of gradual decrease with increasing field. This can be due to the increase of λ with magnetic field due to the anisotropic order parameter and the associated non- linear effect due to the Doppler shift of the quasiparticles in the nodal region . However, the field range in our experiment is too narrow to discuss this in more de- tail. Based on the σ(B) measurements, we studied the temperature dependence of σ in a magnetic field of 600 mT (the largest available field of the GPS spectrometer at PSI).

As an oxygen source, Ag 2 O 2 (that readily releases O 2 upon heating while decomposing via Ag 2 O to Ag) was utilized: Ag 2 O 2 was mixed with Co-1212 powder to a molar ratio of 1 : 2. XRD patterns for the HPO samples are shown in . Comparison with those for the AS samples (reveals that the HPO annealing had no effect on the phase purity of the samples. On the other hand, in where the lattice parameters are plotted for both the AS and the HPO samples, it is observed that upon HPO annealing the lattice drastically shrank along the b and c axes, whereas the a-axis parameter remained unchanged. As a consequence of the b-axis shrinkage, the degree of orthorhombic distortion decreases. We recognize the same from the fact that every pair of double peaks seen in the XRD pattern for the AS samples, e.g. 026 and 206, 136 and 316, 138 and 318, merges into a single peak after HPO annealings. This suggests that the CoO 4 tetrahedra have got broken as a consequence of the change in the oxygen amount/arrangement about the Co atom. For the HPO-annealed samples superconductivity appears with the transition temperature (T c ) up to 40 K (as determined at the onset of the diamagnetic signal) for the x = 0.3 sample. The largest volume fraction of superconductivity (16 % from the ZFC data and 11 % from the FC data) is due to the x = 0.35 sample. In , we show the T c values for all the HPO samples as plotted against x. A bell-shape relation is seen. In we have shown the χ vs. T curve for the x = 0.4 sample as an example. Now a question arises on the primary reason for the appearance of superconductivity in the HPO samples. To be able to reach the correct answer, we first investigated whether the pure high-pressure (HP) effect alone would induce superconductivity in the Ca-substituted CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+δ samples. As-synthesized powder with x = 0.4 was annealed without Ag 2 O 2 at 5 GPa and 500 o C for 30 min, i.e. under the condition otherwise the same as that employed for the HPO samples except that no excess oxygen source was added.","1"

On the other hand, the amount of Ag seen in the XRD pattern did not visibly increase as compared to that seen for the HPO sample. Therefore, it is likely that the weight/oxygen loss detected by TG upon N 2 annealing is primarily due to the Co-1212 phase itself. This conclusion is supported by the magnetization data: upon annealing the HPO sample in N 2 not only superconductivity but also the magnetic transition characteristically seen for all the HPO samples around 150 K disappeared ). Note that the origin of the magnetic transition (manifested by the branching of the ZFC and FC magnetization curves) was left unaddressed yet, as the structure of the CoO 1+δ charge reservoir is not determined for the HPO samples. The second, smaller weight step in the TG curve about 300 o C well coincides with that seen for the decomposition of pure Ag 2 O . We thus assign the second step for the decomposition of leftover Ag 2 O, i.e. y ≈ 0.4, and the first step only to the oxygen evolution from the Co-1212 phase, i.e. δ ≈ 0.4. As the final step of the present work we checked the optimum amount of Ag 2 O 2 used as a source of excess oxygen in the HPO annealing. The first HPO treatments were all carried out with 50 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 . Here we made ad hoc HPO annealings for the x = 0.4 sample using 25 and 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 . It was found that with 25 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 , the c axis decreased less as compared with the case of 50 mol-%. More importantly, the sample did not show superconductivity. On the other hand, with 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 peaks due to Ag 2 O appeared in the XRD pattern for the HPO annealed sample. The annealed sample exhibited superconductivity with a lower T c value of 20 K than that of the HPO annealed product with 50 mol-% of Ag 2 O 2 (T c ≈ 35 K). It was thus revealed that the optimum amount of Ag 2 O 2 as an oxygen source for the HPO annealing is in the vicinity of 50 mol-%. Here it should also be noted that we annealed the two new HPO samples in a thermobalance in N 2 . From the TG curves shown in Fig. together with that for the sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 we could see the following features: the second weight-loss step about 300 o C that we had previously assigned to the decomposition of leftover Ag 2 O was not seen at all for the HPO sample with 25 % Ag 2 O 2 (y ≈ 0), whereas it was more pronounced for that with 100 % Ag 2 O 2 (y ≈ 1.0) in comparison with the original HPO sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 (y ≈ 0.4). The amount of oxygen depleted from the Co-1212 phase in the first weight-loss step increased with increasing amount of Ag 2 O 2 used for the HPO annealing, i.e.  In conclusion, we have systematically clarified the influence of aliovalent Ca II -for-Y III substitution and high-pressure-oxygen annealing on the superconductivity of CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+δ (Co-1212) samples. It was found that at least up to x ≈ 0.4 Ca dissolves in the Co-1212 phase at the Y site. Within this range of Ca substitution the oxygen content of as-synthesized samples remained stoichiometric. Therefore we could assure that holes were gradually doped in the Co-1212 structure upon Ca substitution. The as-synthesized samples, however, were not superconductive, suggesting that the holes created by the divalent-for-trivalent substitution are trapped about the Co atom in the charge reservoir. The combination of Ca substitution and high-pressure-oxygen annealing was necessary to induce superconductivity in the Co-1212 phase. The highest T c obtained in the present study for the HPO-annealed x = 0.3 sample was ∼40 K.","1"

We report that superconductivity in the infinite-layer compound Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 is of a three-dimensional nature, in contrast to the quasi two-dimensional superconducting behavior of all other cuprates. The key observation is that the c-axis coherence length is longer than the c-axis lattice constant even at zero temperature. This means that the superconducting order parameter of one CuO2 plane overlaps with those of neighboring CuO2 planes all the temperatures below the Tc. Among all cuprates, only the infinite- layer superconductor shows such a feature.","0"
"935","SSC1230017-CC","2","The key ingredient of high-temperature superconduc- tors (HTSC) is the CuO 2 plane in which superconduc- tivity occurs. Besides the CuO 2 plane, the unit cell of HTSC generally contains a charge-reservoir block (CRB) which supplies holes or electrons into the conducting layer. However, the function of the CRB, beyond sup- plying carriers in the materials, is not yet completely clear. In one respect, the CRB might simply be a spacer between the CuO 2 planes. In this case, the block reduces the layer-by-layer coupling. The strong anisotropic na- ture of HTSC is believed to be a reflection of this weak interlayer coupling. In this context, the infinite-layer compounds ACuO 2 (A = alkaline-earth ions) are remark- able, because they do not have a CRB, so the simplicity of their crystal structure may allow in-depth insight into the basic mechanism of cuprate superconductivity. Due to the absence of the CRB, infinite-layer compounds have two notable features. First, the distance from one unit cell to the next is the shortest among all the cuprates. Secondly, as a matter of course, charge carriers can be supplied only from the cations at the A sites. For example, the carrier density of the stoichometric infinite- layer SrCuO 2 is zero. The partial substitution of La +3 (or Nd +3 ) for Sr +2 results in superconductivity in these compounds. In this case, the carriers are not holes, but electrons.","0"

In this work, we mea- sured the reversible magnetization as a function of the temperature and the angle between the c axis and the applied magnetic field. From analysis of the data, we found that the usual HTSC two-dimensional (2D) tem- perature region of ξ c (T ) < c below T c did not exist in this compound. This peculiar feature has not been observed in any other high-T c material. Until now, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Y-123) has been known to have the most strong inter- layer coupling, but the three-dimensional (3D) tempera- ture region is limited to near T c only. Previously, it was claimed that the high-T c superconductivity occurred only on the 2D network of CuO 2 planes, since a 3D net- work did not permit spin or charge fluctuation while a 1D structure did not establish long range order of super- conductivity. Hence, our observation of 3D superconduc- tivity in entire region below T c in Sr(La)-112 provides a new aspect of high-temperature superconductivity.","1"

In this figure, the symbols and the lines denote the zero-field-cooled and the field-cooled magnetizations, respectively. In comparison with other cuprates, our data show two interesting features. First, the curves shift to lower temperature as the field increases and are almost parallel to each other. This typical mean-field behavior is consistent with the prediction of the Abrikosov model in which the magnetization scales linearly with the magnetic field. Such a feature has never been observed before for any high-T c cuprate because the mean-field behavior is usually screened by strong thermal fluctua- tions. Secondly, the rate of decrease of T c (H) with respect to the field is significantly larger than that of other cuprates, here the superconducting transition tem- perature, T c (H), is estimated as the temperature at the point of intersection of a linear extrapolation of 4πM (T ) in the superconducting state with the normal-state base line of 4πM = 0. For instance, at H = 5 T, T c (H) is found to be about 33 K, which corresponds to 0.77T c (0). Hence, the upper-critical field H c2 (0) is expected to be about 20 T, assuming a linear T c (H). To determine H c2 (0) precisely, we apply the Hao-Clem model for re- versible magnetization to our data. The details of the analysis will be given elsewhere (M.-S. Kim et al., manuscript in preparation). Two important parameters characterizing the compound are the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, κ, and the slope of the upper-critical field near T c , dH c2 /dT | Tc . The Hao-Clem model analysis gives κ = 25.3 ± 1.1 and dH c2 /dT | Tc = −0.47 ± 0.02 T/K. Using these, we estimate H c2 (0) to be 13.9 ± 0.5 T through the relationship H c2 (0) ≃ 0.7(dH c2 /dT ) Tc T c, which is about ten times smaller than the value for other cuprate superconductors. The in-plane coher- ence length ξ ab (0) = [φ 0 /2πH c2 (0)] 1/2 is calculated to be 48.6 ± 1.0Å, where φ 0 is the flux quantum. In our study, we apply the Hao-Clem model to de- scribe our magnetization data. Since the model is derived from the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, our result is justified in the GL framework. However, we judge our result not to be model depen- dent particularly from the following consideration: The open symbols in the inset of represent the in-plane magnetic penetration depth, λ ab (T ), obtained from the dc-magnetic susceptibility, 4πχ(T ), for the low-field re- gion of H < H c1 . To deduce λ ab (T ) from the 4πχ(T ) curve, we use the Shoenberg formula, which is not model dependent, but is merely based on the London equations. For comparison, we also plot λ ab (T ) (filled symbols) from the Hao-Clem analysis in the same figure.","0"

In the framework of the London model, the penetration depth is proportional to (m * ab /n s ) 1/2 , where m * and n s are the electronic effective mass in the ab plane and the charge-carrier density, re- spectively. According to the empirical Uemura relation, i.e., T c ∼ n s /m * ab , the T c 's of the two compounds should be nearly the same. However, the T c of Sr(La)-112 is about half that of Y-123.

The increase is postulated to originate from the thermal fluctuation effect, as mentioned above. In the open-symbol set, however, no such plateau feature exists. In fact, the London model is known to be suitable for the low-field region of H ≪ H c2 . Since our magneti- zation data were taken near the transition temperature, the external field of 1 T is regarded as considerably large. Thus, our data set is out of the London region.

Far from the vortex, the superconducting gap is only slightly affected [blue curves in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e)], and it is gradually suppressed upon approaching the vortex core. Within a few nanometers of one vortex core center, weak ZBCPs are observed with a full width at half maximum of about 0.29 meV [red curves in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e)]. This ZBCP is observed for the first time in vortices of Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 (Refs. ). It could be composed of both conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound states and the long-predicted Majorana bound state expected at zero energy in 2D TSC. These are hard to distinguish because the energy separation of the bound states δE ¼ Δ 2 =E F (Ref. ) is about 0.4 μeV here, assuming Δ k ¼ 0.5 meV and E F ¼ 650 meV. Nevertheless, our observation of a ZBCP is consistent with the prediction of TSC in Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 . As shown in (f) and Figs. S9(d), S9(e), and S10 in Ref. , ZBCPs have also been observed in some vortex cores under B ⊥ ¼ 0.3 T, but their intensities are slightly weaker than under B ⊥ ¼ 0.2 T. The spectrum near zero bias is distorted for B ⊥ ¼ 0.4 T, and the ZBCP is clearly absent for B ⊥ ¼ 0.6 T, as shown in and in Ref. . This behavior resembles the evolution of the Majorana zero-energy mode observed in 5-QL Bi 2 Te 3 films grown on NbSe 2 (Ref. ). The weakening and disappearance of a ZBCP in the vortex core under high field is interpreted as a result of the coupling between states in adjacent vortices . When the field is small, the distance between vortices is large compared to the vortex core size, so the interaction between the vortex bound states can be neglected. Upon increasing field, the intervortex distance shortens, enhancing these interactions and even- tually destroying the Majorana zero mode .","0"

Under various B == , no obvious in-plane vortices are observed on the surface, and the superconduct- ing spectra are spatially homogeneous (see Part 4 of Ref. for more details). This phenomenon is possible because the superconductivity on the surface (likely resides in topological surface state) is more robust to the orbital depairing of an in-plane field so that the bulk vortex lines are pushed away from the surface, as shown theoretically in Ref. . Consequently, the in-plane field does not gen- erate noticeable spatial inhomogeneity on the supercon- ducting spectrum.

Clearly, the superconducting gap, as estimated from both the leading edge (Δ Ã LE ) and coherence peaks (Δ Ã CP ), varies with θ. We use asterisks (*) here to emphasize that these actually constitute weighted averages of Δ k under B == . The angular dependence of Δ Ã CP and Δ Ã LE based on an extensive data set is summarized in and exhibits clear twofold symmetry, with maxima around θ ¼ 90°and 270°(coincid- ing with the y axis) and minima near θ ¼ 0°and 180°( coinciding with the x axis). show similar twofold symmetry for B == ¼ 1.0 T. In addition, Δ Ã LE along θ ¼ 85°, 40°, and 0°decrease monotonically with increasing B == , and no crossover is observed between them, as shown in and in Ref. . Our detailed experiments indicate that the superconducting gap (Δ Ã CP and Δ Ã LE ) of Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 exhibits twofold symmetry throughout the studied B == range from 0.25 to 1.5 T. The suppression of the superconducting gap by B == is much faster along the x axis (θ ¼ 0°) than nearly along the y axis (θ ¼ 85°), suggesting a smaller upper critical field B c2 along the x axis. Thus, a larger ξ y is evaluated than ξ x from the Ginzburg-Landau relations B x c2 ¼ ½ðΦ 0 Þ=ð2πξ c ξ y Þ and B y c2 ¼ ½ðΦ 0 Þ=ð2πξ c ξ x Þ, which is consistent with our obser- vations that the vortex is elongated along the y axis of the lattice shown in .

The gradual smearing of the gap edge (Δ Ã LE ) of the DOS under B == is consistent with the Volovik effect; the quasiparticle energy spectrum is Doppler shifted in the mixed state due to a supercurrent flow running around the vortices, which leads to a broad- ening of the gap edge even for a nodeless superconductor at finite temperature .","0"

"974","PhysRevX.8.041024-CC","22","orbital depairing effect of B == (in-plane vortex) is not obvious here, the influence of B == on superconductivity mainly includes two effects: the Volovik and Zeeman effects. The former effect has been extensively studied in nodal superconductors theoretically and exper- imentally and leads to a DOS under B == that exhibits characteristic oscillatory behavior with field ori- entation. At low temperature and low field, as illustrated in , more quasiparticles are excited when the field is perpendicular to the gap minimal direction of Δ k than along other directions because the field-induced supercurrents (which run perpendicular to the field) can lead to the strongest Doppler shift of the quasiparticle energy around the gap minimal region. Thus, the short axis of Δ Ã LE is actually perpendicular to the gap minimal direction, since this field orientation produces the most quasiparticle excitations. Meanwhile, the application of B == will induce Zeeman effect, whose energy scale is about 0.1 meV for B == ¼ 1.0 T, comparable to the minimal gap magnitude (0.256 meV) in the SC-I region. For E u -symmetry pairing, the d vector is expected to be parallel to the maximal gap direction of Δ k , and it is normal to the plane in which the spins of the equal-spin-paired electrons are aligned . The Zeeman depairing effect is the strongest when B == is parallel to the d vector because the electron spins may deviate from the original plane under sufficient B == . Therefore, both the Volovik effect and Zeeman effect will suppress Δ Ã LE much more strongly when B == lies along the maximal gap direction of Δ k . Consequently, the distribu- tion of Δ k for the SC-I region can be qualitatively determined; as illustrated by the thick blue curve in , the gap maxima are along a Se─Se bond direction, which is rotated 90°from the long axis of Δ Ã LE . The tunneling spectra here and the specific heat measured by Yonezawa et al. reflect the integrated DOS over the Fermi surface under the influence of B == , and they thus exhibit weaker anisotropy than Δ k , whose anisotropy can be more precisely estimated by fitting the tunneling spectra or via the vortex anisotropy. The blue curve thus gives the first semiquanti- tative sketch of an anisotropic nodeless gap structure in Cu x Bi 2 Se 3. This angular distribution of the Δ k is consistent with the orientation of the observed elongated vortices as, empirically, a vortex will extend out in the direction of a gap minimum (assuming only weak Fermi velocity anisotropy) .","0"

According to above analysis, the angular distribution of Δ k in domain A is illustrated by the blue curve, with its maxima again along a Se─Se bond direction. Similar to the case of the SC-I region, in domain B of the SC-II region, which has the same lattice orientation as domain A, the long axis of Δ Ã LE under B == ¼ 1.0 T is rotated to an intermediate angle, about 20.7°off another dihedral mirror plane, as shown in and in Ref. . The origin of such a rotation under B == ¼ 1.0 T is unclear and merits future investigation. Our data show that gap nematicity is ubiquitous in all the super- conducting domains of Cu x Bi 2 Se 3, the long C 2 axis of Δ k is pinned along one of the three equivalent Se─Se bond directions, which may vary for different SC domains (see more discussion in Part 9 of Ref. ).","0"

The Δ 4y gap distribution is supported by specific heat and magnetoresistance measurements . However, our data suggest that the gap maxima of Δ k are pinned along one of the three equivalent Se─Se bond directions, consistent with the NMR study and supporting a Δ 4x pairing sym- metry without nodes. The differences among bulk mea- surements remind us that the summed responses from all domains with different gap amplitudes and orientations may give an average gap maximum rotated from the actual ones, as the multidomain effect is directly observed in our study of the SC-II region (Part 9 of Ref. ) and previously discussed by Yonezawa et al. in of their paper .

On the one hand, we observe a Dirac-conelike surface DOS in the SC-I regions, a ZBCP in vortex cores under 0.2-0.3 T out-of- plane fields, and a nematic superconducting order param- eter with an anisotropic gap and a preferential symmetry axis. A nematic superconducting state with an anisotropic gap has been predicted only for odd-parity superconduc- tivity , and the preferential direction of the C 2 symmetry axis of the gap and its highly nontrivial response to field strength indeed suggest a pseudospin triplet pairing . The ZBCP might be the long-sought Majorana bound state, so our findings further support topologically nontrivial superconductivity in this material. On the other hand, many aspects of our data are not readily explained by current theories for TSC. For example, we neither observe in-gap states (and in Ref. ) at the step edge as would be expected for a two-dimensional TSC , nor do we observe in-gap states corresponding to Majorana fermions on the surface as expected for a three- dimensional TSC . It is still mysterious why the predicted point nodes appear to be gapped out and why the long axis of Δ Ã LE rotates under high B == . In short, our findings reveal the microscopic behavior of the nematic superconductivity in Cu x Bi 2 Se 3, which will facilitate an understanding of its extraordinary properties and micro- scopic pairing mechanism, and more importantly, our data impose strong constraints for further improving theories of topological superconductivity.","0"

"1033","APL0774202-CC","2","The London penetration depth, λ(T ), is a quantity of fundamental importance. Its temperature, field, and doping dependencies are directly related to the density of quasiparticle energy states, knowledge of which is cru- cial for testing models of pairing symmetry and mecha- nisms of superconductivity . λ(T ) is also a key param- eter in determining the response and collective proper- ties of the Abrikosov vortex lattice . For single crys- tals, measurements of the resonant frequency shift of a microwave cavity or tunnel diode oscillator provide the highest resolution for changes of the pene- tration depth, ∆λ ≡ λ(T ) − λ(T min ), with respect to temperature. For the sub-mm sized crystals typically studied in high-T c work, resolution of better than 0.2Å can be achieved . However, the usual resonator ap- proach has the disadvantage that it does not provide the absolute magnitude of λ. This shortcoming arises from various experimental uncertainties and is not an inher- ent limitation of the resonator technique.

We focus on a lumped LC resonator but the ideas also hold for a distributed device such as a microwave cavity. In the absence of a superconducting sample the empty resonant frequency is f 0 = 1/ √ LC. When a supercon- ducting sample is inserted into the resonator, the induc- tance L decreases due to a decrease of the magnetic field energy W m = LI 2 /2c 2 as a result of Meissner expulsion. For a platelet sample of thickness 2d in the z− direction and mean planar dimensions 2w × 2w in the x − y plane, this leads to an increase of the frequency by an amount ∆f ≡ f (T ) − f (0) given by Here V s is the sample volume, V 0 is the effective volume of the resonator, N is the demagnetization factor and the field is applied along the z direction.

(1), the difference between the perfect diamagnet and sample with finite λ is only f 0 (1 − λ/R) ≈ 30 Hz for a typical YBCO crystal where R ≥ 50 µm and λ(0) = 0.15 µm which is quite compara- ble to the static uncertainty, δf 0 ≈ 10 Hz. Furthermore, extracting and inserting the sample gives the value of ∆f 0 already reduced by finite λ(0). Other methods of estima- tion of ∆f 0 such as measuring a ball made of a conven- tional superconductor or replicating an HTSC sample using low-T c material 3 result even in greater uncertainty, because in addition to an inevitable ""static"" uncertainty between different runs there are additional uncertainties related to differences between real sample and the sub- stitute. Furthermore, realistic samples are irregular and so have dimensions which are uncertain to much more than λ(T ). They may also have large demagnetizing ef- fects. Finally Eq. (1) itself involves approximations for R that adds further error. It is therefore not feasible to measure λ(T ) using resonator frequency shifts in the straightforward manner outlined. Despite this limitation on accuracy, the precision with which changes in λ can be measured is much higher. This is illustrated in by the change ∆f upon warming the sample from low to intermediate temperature. In this case the sample stays fixed so the temperature-independent static uncertainty is irrelevant.

High-purity shots of Sn (99.99%) and Sb (99.999%) with the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 were melted in sealed evacuated quartz tube at 900 o C for 48 h with intermittent shaking to ensure homogeneity, followed by quenching into cold water. The resulting ingot was then annealed at 320 o C for another 48 h, and finally quenched into cold water. The purity of the sample was checked by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical x-ray diffractometer with a monochromatic Cu-K α1 radiation at room temperature. For consistency reason, all the physical property measurements were performed on samples obtained from the same ingot. A part of the ingot was cut into regular-shaped samples for electrical resistivity, Hall coefficient and specific heat measurements, and the remaining part was crushed into powders. The typical dimensions are 4 mm × 0.8 mm × 0.35 mm and 2 mm × 2 mm × 0.2 mm for transport (resistivity/Hall) and specific heat measurements, respectively. The resistivity was measured by using a standard four- probe method. Resistivity, Hall coefficient and specific heat measurements down to 1.8 K were carried out on a Quantum Design PPMS-9 Dynacool. Specific heat measurements down to 0.5 K were preformed on a Quantum Design PPMS-9 Evercool II. The two sets of specific heat data agree well within 5% in the overlapped temperature range.

It is pointed out that the structure of Sb can also be described by the R3m(00γ) space group with γ = 1.5 .

The ρ value at room temperature is ∼28 µΩ cm, which lies in between that of pure Sn and pure Sb . With decreasing temperature, ρ decreases linearly down to ∼50 K and then varies as T 2.4 at lower temperature, which is typical of a normal metal. Nevertheless, the low residual resistivity ratio (ρ 300K /ρ 3K ) of ∼2.6 suggests the presence of significant disorder scattering, likely due to antisite occupation between Sn and Sb. On further cooling below 2.8 K, ρ drops rapidly to zero, evidencing a transition to the superconducting state [inset of Fig. ]. Here we define T ρ c = 2.48 K as the temperature corresponding to the midpoint of the resistive drop. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. , the Hall resistivity depends linearly on the magnetic field, and the corresponding Hall coefficient is negative and nearly temperature independent.

Although a much shorter annealing time is adopted in the present study, it is possible that these inhomogeneous regions are already present, which is responsible for the resistive transition at T ρ c , as in La 3 Rh 4 Sn 3 . Moreover, the initial diamagnetic signal in the susceptibility data could also be due to these regions. Hence we take the shielding fraction of ∼13% at 1.66 K, the temperature at which the linear interpolation of the strong diamagnetic signal intersects with the base line [see Fig. ], as an estimation of the upper limit of their volume faction.

This may result in the increase of density of states and/or phonon softening, and consequently an enhanced T c . Note that the grain boundaries constitute a small fraction of the sample, yet they are connected to form a continuous superconducting path, as observed experimentally.

Actually, this is also the case when one compares the experimental results of SnSb with the theoretically predicted ones assuming the same crystal structure as SnAs . This implies that, within the BCS framework, the lower T c value of SnSb in the rombohedral structure compared with that in the rock-salt structure is due to a decrease in the electron phonon coupling strength. However, it is noted that the electronic band structure of SnAs measured by ARPES is not in full agreement with the calculated one, but bears signatures of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) . As for SnSb, the SOC effect is expected to be even stronger, and hence the possibility of odd-parity pairing cannot be excluded.

The resonance frequency is roughly given as f ∝ 1/ √ LC where L and C represent induc- tance and variable capacitance of the NMR probe, re- spectively. The sample is contained in a coil and the onset of superconductivity is detected by the change of the resonant frequency, i.e. the change of L value. This method corresponds to AC susceptibility measurement. The T dependence of the frequency at several fields is shown in . If we probe the temperature at which the resonance frequency starts to change against H, this gives H c2 vs. T c characteristics as is shown in the inset. For high-T c cuprates, the temperature has been identi- fied as irreversibility temperature T irr . T irr gives a borderline between creeping and freezing of flux lines (FL) which are formed through the planes for the H per- pendicular to the plane. In the present case flux lines are self-trapped between the planes since the field is applied parallel to the plane, and thus such a creep is hardly expected.","0"

T c at this field is about 2.8K as is seen from the inset of . The T dependence of T −1 1 is shown in . The spin gap is observed even under high pressure as an activated T de- pendence of T −1 1 at temperatures higher than 30K, i.e., The value of ∆ spin is estimated to be 173K. It should be noted that the spin gap is seen in the state in which the charge transport is metallic . By contrast, T −1 1 below 30K is dominated by a term showing T -linear dependence followed by a peak devel- oped below T c . The onset and the position of the peak shift to higher temperature with decreasing the magnetic field to 5.0T (open squares in ). If the T -linear component originates from extrinsic source, it should be persistent in the superconducting state. However, T −1 1 measured at low temperatures obviously goes below the T -linear line shown in the figure. Then, such a case is excluded. As for the peak the possibility of vortex mo- tion might be pointed out. The vortex motion has been observed from T −1 1 of ligand sites in high-T c cuprates such as YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 or HgBa 2 CuO 4+δ when the H is applied perpendicular to the plane. The FL is self-trapped between the planes for the H parallel to the plane, and thus the effect is hardly expected in the present case. In fact, the effect disappears when the H is applied parallel to the planes in HBCO system . Fur- thermore, T −1 1 /γ 2 N (γ N : nuclear gyromagnetic ratio ) at the peak is 80 or 25 times larger than those for YBCO or HBCO, respectively. The value is too large to explain the peak due to vortex motion. Hence, we conclude that the peak of T −1 1 and the T -linear component have the same origin in the electric state and/or spin fluctuations. The peak can be assigned to a superconducting coherence peak and the T -linear dependence of T −1 1 to Korringa- type behavior, where the value of b is about 6.1 (sec −1 K −1 ). The ob- servation of the clear peak implies that a finite gap ex- ists in the quasi-particle excitation at all wave vectors. In the meaning that there exist no nodes in the pairing symmetry, the superconductivity possesses a s-wavelike character.","0"

The shift is given as a sum of two components, the orbital and the spin parts (K = K orb + K spin ) and the spin part is proportional to the spin susceptibility. The T dependence of K at high temperatures fits well the theoretical curve for a spin-ladder system , The gap ∆ spin obtained from the fit is 217K and is com- parable with that estimated from T −1 1 . The value of K 0 is estimated to be 0.25%. The main contribution of K 0 comes from K orb comparable with that for high-T c cuprates (K 0 of YBCO, for example, is 0.28% .) The paramagnetic contribution corresponding to the Ko- rringa term in T −1 1 (Eq. (2) should be included in K 0 . The shift in the low temperature region around T c is shown in . The raw data at several fields are also plotted in the figure since T c depends on the fields. As seen from the figure, no appreciable change is seen at T c .

We can obtain direct access under pressure to important FS parameters through the measurement of the upper critical field H c2 (T ). Indeed, since the seminal work of Hohenberg and Werthammer , it is known that the orbital limitation of H c2 (T ) is mainly controlled by the Fermi velocity v F . As a consequence, H c2 (T ) can appreciably deviate from the usual (almost parabolic) behavior in clean superconductors when the various sheets of the FS have different electron phonon coupling parameters and Fermi velocities. In such a case, an eventually complex FS can often be modelled by just two bands, allowing to extract the main anisotropies in λ and v F from H c2 (T ) . In a previous article we have measured the pressure evolution of the critical temperature T c and upper critical field H c2 (T ) of two topical superconductors, MgB 2 , and the nickel borocarbide YNi 2 B 2 C, and obtained the pressure induced changes on λ and v F using such an effective two band model .

This approximation gives the overall pressure evolution of the anisotropy of λ and of v F , although their absolute values may somewhat change in a more detailed treatment. For the ambient pressure H c2 (T ) we fix λ 1 = 1.6 and λ 2 = 0.16 to obtain a corresponding overall mass renormalization (m * 1 /m − 1) = λ 11 + λ 12 = 1.76 (strong coupling Nb 4d cylinders), and (m * 2 /m − 1) = λ 22 + λ 21 = 0.32 (weak coupling Se 4p derived pocket) that compares well with the values mentioned above and obtained from de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) and ARPES studies . From the fit to H c2 (T ), we deduce the values of the ambient pressure unrenormalized Fermi velocities, v F,1 = 0.055 10 6 m/s and v F,2 = 1 10 6 m/s. Other parameters of the model are the Coulomb pseudopotential µ * = 0.1, fixed arbitrarily, and a mean phonon frequency of θ = 55K, which is imposed to be pressure independent and is adjusted to give the right T c at P = 0.

On the other hand, v F,1 increases under pressure up to 8.3 GPa, where a clear peak is observed. The evolution of v F,2 is exactly opposite and becomes roughly pressure independent above 15 GPa, where the coupling strength becomes more isotropic, but the FS anisotropy remains. Let us first discuss the evolution of the Fermi velocities, which points to a new charac- teristic pressure of 8.3 GPa. Anomalies on v F might reflect changes in the Fermi surface topology. Indeed, assuming bands with a roughly quadratical dispersion, the Fermi veloci- ties are related to their radius in k-space. The eventual closing of a gap results in an increase of the area of the relevant FS, as already observed in the compound YNi 2 B 2 C, where the behavior of H c2 (T ) under pressure evidences a strong increase of v F in the strong coupling bands, related to the disappearance of a FS nesting feature under pressure . On the other hand, in the case of MgB 2 , the observed decrease in v F,1 under pressure is related to a continuous shrinking of the strong coupling sheets under pressure due to the reduction of their hole doping, achieved at zero pressure through its ionic layered character .","0"

"1132","L095117006-CC","16","Moreover, the whole smooth increase of λ 2 from 0.3 up to 0.8 at intermediate pressures reflects the progressive decrease of weight of the effect of the Se 4p pancake pocket on the weak coupling parameters of the effective two band model, in favor of the Nb 4d cylinder which shows, at ambient pressure, intermediate coupling. The increase of v F,2 above 8.3 GPa then reflects, like λ 2 , the dominant effect in H c2 (T) of the Nb 4d bands at higher pressures. So the main feature pointed out by the minimum of v F,2 and the increase of λ 2 is a charge transfer from the Se 4p pocket, which shrinks under pressure, to the Nb 4d-derived cylinders, which correspondingly increase its size. This leaves only the Nb 4d bands control H c2 (T ) at the highest pressures.","0"

It is remarkable that this maximum occurs only in the strong coupling part of the FS, i.e. the Nb 4d-derived cylinders.

For example, in many layered high T c superconductors, a close relationship is found between the doping dependence of T c and of T * , the pseudogap critical temperature (in hole doped as well as in electron doped materials, see e.g. ). In the Ce heavy fermion systems under pressure , a maximum appears in T c at the same pressure where the Neel temperature is suppressed, demonstrating the implications of the softening of magnetic modes in the formation of superconducting correlations. In the case of 2H-NbSe 2 , it would be also tempting to interpret the peak in λ 1 in terms of some kind of mode softening near the suppression of the CDW order. However, we can equally argue that the increase in λ 1 when T CDW decreases is related to an increase of the density of states due to the pressure induced suppression of the CDW gap. In that case, clearly, the CDW ground state would be in strong competition with superconductivity.","0"

The spin-fluctuation-mediated mechanism is a major candi- date for the high-T c mechanism. In fact, the SC phase of the Ba122 series partially overlaps the AF phase, in other words, the SC and AF states are compatible, and the maximum T c occurs close to the phase boundary [see (b)] .

When the interaction between electrons is significantly strong, namely spin fluctuations are pre- dominant, Curie-Weiss-like behavior is derived, whereas, when the interaction is week, 1/T 1 T is determined by the density of states (DOS) at Fermi surfaces.

While certain experiments indicated an unexpected type-I superconducting phase, other experiments re- vealed formation of vortices under the application of magnetic fields. Recently, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed the existence of a mixed phase where type-I and type-II behaviours coexist. Here, based on our temperature and magnetic field dependent STS experiments on Cu-intercalated PdTe2 we show that as the critical temperature of the superconducting phase goes up from 1.7 K to 2.4 K on Cu-intercalation, the mixed phase disappears and the system be- comes homogeneously type-II. This may be attributed to an averaging effect caused by quasiparticle exchange between type-I and type-II domains mediated by the Cu atoms and to decreased coherence length due to increased disorder.","1"

Though initial experi- mental papers suggested the possibility of an unconven- tional nature of the superconducting phase of PdTe 2 , a number of experiments confirmed that the superconduc- tivity in PdTe 2 is conventional in nature . How- ever, some of these experiments found evidence of type I behaviour as far as the magnetic properties of the su- perconducting phase of PdTe 2 are concerned . These contradicted with certain other experiments where the magnetic properties were found to be consistent with type II superconductivity . More recently, magnetic field dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy exper- iments revealed coexistence of type I and type II do- mains in PdTe 2 where such an inhomogeneity of the su- perconducting phase was attributed to electronic inho- mogeneities observed in the normal state of PdTe 2 . It turned out that the electronic inhomogeneity could alter the local electron density and the local coherence length thereby leading to a distribution of the Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gorkov (GLAG) parameter (κ) over the surface of PdTe 2 . Within this picture, it should be possible to disorder the system so that inter-domain scattering of the quasiparticles can average out the κ dis- tribution and make the system homogeneous. In this pa- per, we report the observation of such averaging effect in Cu-PdTe 2 by magnetic field dependent scanning tun- neling spectroscopy experiments.

For the spectroscopic measurements presented in this paper we used high quality single crys- tals of Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 with 4% Cu in the crys- tals. The shiny single crystals were first mounted in a ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cleaving stage integrated with the STM. The crystals were then cleaved at 80 K us- ing a cleaver attached to an UHV manipulator. After cleaving, the crystals were immediately transferred to the STM head which is cooled down to 310 mK using a H 3 -based cryostat. The sample is placed at the center of a solenoidal superconducting magnet with a maximum field strength of 11 Tesla. All the STM/S experiments re- ported in this paper were performed with sharp metallic tips of tungsten (W). The tips were fabricated by electro- chemical etching and were cleaned by electron beam bom- bardment under UHV in a preparation chamber attached to the STM prior to the low temperature experiments.

Clear image of the lattice captured from a defect-free region is shown in the inset of (a). The patterns formed around the Cu atoms could be an interference pattern caused by incoming quasiparticles and their counterparts scattered from the Cu atoms.

For the type of spectra shown in (c), the extracted value of ∆ is 0.53 meV. To note, the experimental spec- tra slightly deviate from the theoretical fits just above the coherence peaks -this deviation was not seen in case of non intercalated PdTe 2 . As we will discuss later, this type of spectra correspond to a higher T c ∼ 2.4 K. At certain other points, the spectra are seen to be different and their analysis reveal a smaller ∆ ∼ 0.44 meV. These spectra also correspond to a lower T c ∼ 1.7 K. The de- viation of the experimental data from the theoretical fits are seen for these spectra as well. For the spectra with smaller ∆, though the T c remains to be same as that of pure PdTe 2 , the gap is measured to be higher than in pure PdTe 2 (∼ 0.32 meV). Hence, the the effect of intercalation is present everywhere including the points where a lower T c (and lower ∆) is measured.","0"

This suggests that the phase with higher T c, though does not arise uniformly throughout the crystals, exceeds the percolation threshold thereby contributing predominantly in bulk transport measure- ments. In order to search for a correlation between the domains with higher T c phase and the defect states due to Cu, we performed local spectroscopy near and away from such defects. It was observed that the higher T c phase appears more frequently in the Cu rich regions.","0"
"1169","1903.04321-CC","8","One of the most intriguing features of the supercon- ducting phase of PdTe 2 is that despite hosting topologi- cally non-trivial bands crossing the Fermi surface, the superconducting order parameter is found to be con- ventional and is seen to follow BCS-like temperature dependence. The conventional nature of the tem- perature dependence is also found in case of the two en- ergy gaps that are measured in Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 . The temperature dependent spectra along with the the- oretical fits are shown in (a) for the phase with higher ∆ and in (b) for the phase with lower ∆. Surprisingly, in both the cases, while the lowest temper- ature spectra showed no additional features other than the sharp coherence peaks, at slightly elevated temper- atures a small zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) is also seen to appear. When the emergence of the ZBCP is considered along with the slight deviation of the ex- perimental spectra from the theoretical fit, it is impor- tant to first investigate whether a tiny unconventional component in the order parameter can be present here. Such a ZBCP may appear due to a small unconventional component in the gap function that has a different tem- perature dependence than the dominating conventional component. In order to understand this point clearly, let us consider a temperature dependent gap amplitude given by ∆(T ) = α∆ s (T ) + β∆ un (T ), where ∆ s is the conventional component and ∆ un is the unconventional component of the gap, and α and β are the respective coefficients. Now, since the ZBCP does not appear at low temperatures, it is clear that at those temperatures, α∆ s β∆ un . Now, with increasing temperature, due to the possible difference in temperature dependence of ∆ s and ∆ un , at some point, the contribution of ∆ un may become comparable to ∆ s thereby making the un- conventional contribution detectable in the form of the ZBCP. Beyond this temperature, as shown in the data, all the spectroscopic features related to superconductiv- ity get systematically reduced with a complete disappear- ance of the spectral features at T c . It should be noted that while the possibility of an unconventional compo- nent cannot be ruled out, the ZBCP may also originate from other sources, like inelastic impurity scattering with non-trivial temperature dependence. Since no ZBCP is seen in pure PdTe 2 , here, the enhanced scattering may be due to the impurity states of the Cu intercalates. Since the strength of the ZBCP is significantly smaller than the overall spectra, we have fitted the temperature de- pendent spectra ignoring the ZBCP. The temperature dependent ∆ thus obtained, are plotted in (c) and (d) respectively for the larger ∆ and the smaller ∆. The red dots represent the measured values of ∆ and the solid lines show the expected temperature dependence within BCS theory, barring a slight devia- tion at higher temperatures. In both the cases, the tem- perature evolution of the spectra is consistent with BCS theory. From the measured valued of ∆ and T c , it is seen that ∆/k B T c are ∼ 2.56 and 3.15 corresponding to the larger ∆ and the smaller ∆ respectively. This means, the regions where the effect of intercalation is smaller, ∆/k B T c is higher. This shows that the elctron-phonon coupling strength decreases upon Cu-intercalation. This result apparently contradicts the theoretical finding of an enhanced electron-phonon coupling constant (λ ph ) in Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 . Therefore, our results sug- gest that the enhancement in T c in Cu-PdTe 2 is primarily due to the enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy and not due to altered electron-phonon coupling. How- ever, these two processes may compete with each other giving rise to an effective enhancement of superconduct- ing properties in Cu-PdTe 2 . Now we focus on the magnetic field dependent spec- troscopic measurements on Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 . As it was discovered before, the surface of pure PdTe 2 hosts co-existence of domains with type I and type II super- conductivity. In the type I domains, the superconducting spectra suddenly disappeared under the application of a low magnetic field ∼ 250 Oe. In the type II regions, the spectra survived up to much higher magnetic fields and the spectral features were seen to disappear continuously. Such variation of the type of superconductivity based on magnetic properties could be attributed to inhomo- geneity of local coherence length (ξ). An inhomogeneous background possibly responsible for such inhomogeneity in ξ was found in the normal state conductance maps. Within this understanding, introduction of disorder into the crystal is expected to reduce ξ everywhere.","0"
"1170","1903.04321-CC","9","In we show magnetic field dependent tunnelling conductance spectra captured at 310 mK at three different points on the surface of Cu-PdTe 2 . In all cases, the conductance spectra, regardless of the corre- sponding superconducting energy gaps and T c , evolved systematically and smoothly with magnetic field. The spectral features continuously became less prominent eventually disappearing at a critical field characteristic for the point where the spectroscopic measurement was performed. The critical fields measured in these cases are 10 kG, 17 kG and 4.5 kG respectively. The ubiquitously observed very low critical field (∼ 220 Oe) in PdTe 2 was not detected on any point in Cu-PdTe 2 . It should be noted that the measured critical fields at different points is much larger than the expected ""surface critical field"" (H s ∼ 1.7H c ) in BCS superconductors. Hence the enhancement is not due to a naturally enhanced sur- face critical field. In (c), we also show Dyne's fit of one set of the magnetic field dependent spectra and the variation of the superconducting energy gap with in- creasing magnetic field is shown in (d), where the smooth disappearance of the gap is clearly visible. This observation indicates that the superconductivity of Cu-PdTe 2 has become uniformly of type II throughout the crystal upon intercalation of Cu. This is different from the mixed type I and type II superconducting phase that was observed in pure PdTe 2 . The observation of the uniformly type II behaviour of the superconducting phase upon Cu-intercalation sup- ports the idea that the mixed type I and type II phase in pure PdTe 2 originated from a distribution of the local coherence length (ξ) and consequent distribution of κ. Introduction of disorder in the lattice causes increased scattering and a consequent decrease in the electronic mean free path (l) leading to a decreased ξ following the relation 1/ξ = 1/ξ 0 + 1/l, where ξ 0 is the BCS coher- ence length in the absolute clean limit. When the local ξ in the type I regions decrease, the GLAG parameter (κ) also decreases and consequently these regions should show magnetic properties of that of type II supercon- ductors. The criteria for the transition from a type I to a type II superconducting state in terms of the mean free path (l) has been discussed elsewhere where it was also shown that beyond a critical value of l, the super- conducting phase is expected to become homogeneously type II.","0"
"1171","1903.04321-CC","10","Another aspect of the magnetic field dependence of ∆ that needs attention is a sudden change in ∆ at H ∼ 100 Oe, where ∆ decreases to almost 50 % of the zero field value. In a type II superconductor, such a sudden change may be associated with the emergence of a su- perconducting vortex in an area very close to the STM tip thereby causing the suppression of local ∆. As shown in the Γ vs. H plot in (d), as ∆ shows a sud- den drop, Γ shows a simultaneous upward jump (by a factor of 6) at approximately the same magnetic field. Γ represents pair breaking mechanisms leading to finite quasiparticle lifetime. Hence, this observation is consis- tent with the field-induced pair breaking under the STM tip, possibly due to the emergence of a nearby vortex core. However, despite our repeated attempts, we did not find spectra with clear zero-bias conductance peak in presence of magnetic field. To note, such zero-bias peaks in presence of sufficiently large magnetic field were frequently observed in pure PdTe 2 . It is possible that in case of Cu-PdTe 2, the nature of the vortex core spectrum changes and becomes featureless and hence remains un- detectable in our experiments. Beyond the field at which the sudden change happens, both ∆ and Γ change grad- ually and beyond a certain field Γ becomes larger than ∆ thereby suppressing the key spectroscopic features.","0"

After careful hydration, nearly single-phase crystals have been obtained in which over 90% of the sample's volume corresponds to the supercon- ducting Na0.3CoO2 • 1.3H2O structure. Susceptibility and specific heat measurements confirm that bulk superconductivity has been achieved. The extracted normal state density of states indicates Fermi-liquid behavior with strong mass enhancement and a modest Wilson ratio.

"1178","L092157004-CC","2","Sodium cobalt oxide, Na x CoO 2 (x ≈ 0.65 to 0.75), has received considerable attention due to its unusual thermal electric properties. Recent studies have re- vealed anomalous non-Fermi liquid behavior in trans- port properties which point to the importance of strong correlations. The cobalt ions form a hexagonal lay- ered structure and the formally 1−x fraction is in the low spin (S = 1 2 ) Co 4+ state, while the x fraction is in the S = 0 Co 3+ state. Interest in this material escalated with the discovery of superconductivity by Takada et al.in Na x CoO 2 • yH 2 O when the sodium concentration is re- duced to about 0.3 and water is intercalated between the layers. The ability to control the sodium content is an exciting development because, in principle, the limit of x = 0 corresponds to a Mott insulator on a triangular lattice with S = 1 2 . Then the hydrated compound can be viewed as electron doping of a Mott insulator with a doping concentration x ≈ 0.3. As such, it is the second known example of superconductivity arising from dop- ing a Mott insulator after the high T c cuprates. The S = 1 2 antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice was in fact the starting point of Anderson's resonating valence bond (RVB) idea,and the new superconductor has been in- terpreted in this light. Until recently, the bulk properties of superconducting Na 0.3 CoO 2 • 1.3H 2 O has been studied mostly using pow- der samples. Single crystal measure- ments are much less plentiful, though such measure- ments are extremely important in order to understand this anisotropic layered compound. In this paper we re- port a new electrochemical method to extract Na from Na x CoO 2 . This is an alternative to the chemical de- intercalation of Na using Br ions introduced by Takada et al. Our electrochemical method permits precise con- trol of the Na content and avoids the environmental haz- ards associated with the use of high molar concentra- tions of Br. In addition, we have succeeded in growing large single crystals of Na x CoO 2 by the floating zone (FZ) method. By applying the electrochemical procedure to the FZ crystals, we have obtained superconducting single crystal samples with which we have carried out a variety of physical property measurements.","0"

The thoroughly mixed and ground powder was calcined at 750C for 12 hours and then reacted at 850C for 24 hours with frequent grindings in between. Na loss was minimized with a fast-heating method. A stoichiometric Na 0.75 CoO 2 feed rod was melted and re-crystallized with an optical floating-zone furnace (4-Xe lamp design, CSI Japan) under oxygen atmosphere. Although Na vapor loss was observed from the white de- posit on the walls of the quartz sample chamber, this loss was minimized by choosing a fast pulling rate. A stable molten zone can be maintained with various pulling rates from 1.5 to 10 mm/hr. Electron probe microscopy anal- ysis (EPMA) indicates the FZ crystal has Na content between 0.71 and 0.74 for a crystal pulled with 2 mm/hr rate. We have grown large single crystals of Na 0.75 CoO 2 (5mm diameter × 8 cm long) successfully with this FZ method. Powder neutron diffraction confirms that the Na level of the FZ crystal is essentially identical to that in the feed rod.

Hydrated Na 0.3 CoO 2 • yH 2 O can be prepared by having the sam- ple anodically polarized with a constant voltage (0.6-1.2 V) until the decaying anodic current reaches a constant value. Alternatively, a constant current (of 0.1-10 mA) can be used to achieve the same charge level by wait- ing until the final open circuit potential reaches ∼ 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Samples obtained directly from the cell are typically in a mixture of the partially hydrated (c ≃ 13.8Å) and fully hydrated (c ≃ 19.7Å) structures and show only trace amounts of superconductivity. Fully hydrated superconducting crystals can be achieved by sealing the sample in a water vapor saturated container at room temperature. We find that the rate of hydration depends on grain size and several months are required to fully hydrate mm-sized single crystals. The sodium content in each sample was checked by electron probe microanalysis.

As shown in , the susceptibility shows a large anisotropy, similar to that reported for Na 0.68 CoO 2 . However, the Curie-Weiss susceptibility that is so prominent there is now absent. The small cusp at 42 K is likely due to a Co 3 O 4 impurity phase, which is known to have an antiferromagnetic transition in the 33 to 46 K range. By comparing the size the magne- tization cusp with that for bulk Co 3 O 4 , we estimate that the Co 3 O 4 impurity fraction of our sample is small, at the 1% level. However, we cannot detect the existence of Co 3 O 4 within our x-ray diffraction sensitivity. Apart from this anomaly and the low temperature Curie tail (which arises from only 0.5% of the Co moments), the susceptibility is nearly temperature independent. Note the large magnitude and strong anisotropy. For compar- ison, the magnitude is about 5 times that of lanthanum strontium cuprate (La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 ) and 30 times that of a simple metal like Na. The anisotropy is probably due to a combination of anisotropy in the g factor and the van Vleck term. AC susceptibility measurements were taken in a field of 3 Gauss/100 Hz as shown in the inset of . The diamagnetic signal is indicative of a su- perconducting phase with an onset temperature of about 4.2 K, and the screening fraction is estimated to be about 120% (without geometric correction).","1"

The sample had been hydrated for three months after electrochemical de-intercalation, and x-ray diffraction indicates that 94% of the sample consists of the fully hydrated superconducting structure. In zero field, a pronounced peak is observed at 4.2 K, indicating the transition to bulk superconductivity. A second broad peak exists at lower temperature around 1.5 K. In a field of 1 T, the superconducting anomaly at 4.2 K is strongly suppressed; in contrast, the peak at 1.5 K is slightly en- hanced. This suggests that the peak around 1.5 K is not related to a second superconducting phase with a lower T c. Such a peak may be compatible with a model of weakly interacting localized Co moments, analogous to the effects seen in impurity-doped semiconductors. In fields larger than 5 T, both peaks disappear and are re- placed by a broad enhancement of C/T over a wide range of temperatures. With increasing field, the enhancement of C/T shifts to higher temperatures. In the inset of , the top panel compares the sup- pression of the superconducting anomaly for H c and H ab. In order to achieve a comparable suppression, an in-plane field with magnitude 5 times that of the the out-of-plane field is required. This reflects the anisotropy of H c2 in the different field orientations and is consistent with our resistivity measurements of H c2 (discussed be- low). We note that ∆C/T c in zero-field for our single crystal sample is comparable to that reported by other groups in powder samples.  The data plotted in the main part of exhibit an upturn at the lowest measured temperatures which increases with increasing field. This is most likely due to a Schottky contribution from the nuclear spins. The bottom panel of the inset shows C/T data at high-fields in which a nuclear Schot- tky contribution (6.7×10 −6 B 2 /T 2 ) has been subtracted. These data demonstrate that in fields greater than ∼10 T superconductivity is completely suppressed. Hence, 10 T may be taken as an upper limit for H c2 with H ab.","1"

Even though the LDA calculation was done for x = 0.5 and without hydration, the bandwidth should be insensitive to these differences. On the other hand, we can fit the observed DOS to that of the free electron tight binding band on a triangular lattice with hopping matrix element t ef f . With t ef f < 0 and x = 0.35, the tight binding DOS for both spins is 0.16/|t ef f |. The measured DOS then implies that |t ef f | ≈ 23 meV, or a full bandwidth of 9|t ef f | ≈ 0.2 eV, which is a factor of 7 smaller than the LDA bandwith. We therefore conclude that there is a mass enhancement of ∼ 7 compared with band theory.

In , we plot H c2 vs. T for both field orientations. There is about a factor of 5 difference in the slopes near T c , con- sistent with the heat capacity data. The value of H c2 for H ab is consistent with the Pauli paramagnetic limit for pair breaking. From the H c2 vs. T curve for H c, we determine a coherence length of ξ ≈ 100Å. This rela- tively short coherence length is surprising for a supercon- ductor with such a low T c, but is entirely consistent with the narrow bandwidth.

Within various iron- pnictide superconductors, we have focused on the isovalent- P-substituted BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2 system and carried out comprehensive NMR studies on the system. This is because the isovalent P substitution introduces a negligible change in carrier concentration but changes magnetic interactions sys- tematically. In addition, very clean single crystals are avail- able for various measurements. By investigating the spin dy- namics probed via P-NMR as a function of P concentration, we showed that the maximum T c is observed at the P concen- tration at which magnetic order vanishes; thus, we suggested that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations associated with quantum criticality play a central role in obtaining high-T c su- perconductivity. We consider that the study of the coexistence of mag- netism and superconductivity, which is observed in the phase boundary, would give important information about the super- conducting (SC) properties and mechanism. There are ex- perimental reports not only from macroscopic and neutron scattering measurements but from microscopic measure- ments of the coexistence and competition of magnetism and superconductivity in iron pnictides. We point out that diffraction measurements give magnetic moments averaged over a wider spatial region and cannot provide microscopic information about the coexistence. It remains an open ques- tion whether an SC phase transition occurs in a magnetic re- gion of a sample or the superconductivity in a magnetic region is induced by the penetration of a nonmagnetic SC region and whether the same or different electronic states contribute to magnetism and superconductivity. In this paper, we report the occurrence of the SC transition in a magnetic region of the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordering, which is concluded from the investigation of internal field and nuclear spin-lattice re- laxation rate 1/T 1 by site-selective NMR measurements.","0"

The P concentration values were determined using an energy-dispersive X-ray an- alyzer and confirmed by lattice-constant measurements since they follow Vegard's law. Figures show the tem- perature dependence of the resistivity ρ xx values of the x = 0.20 and 0.25 samples.

The mag- netic transition temperature derived from ρ xx is in good agree- ment with the NMR results shown later. Each single crystal was fixed randomly with a GE varnish to prevent preferential alignment in the applied magnetic field due to the anisotropy of magnetization and the SC Meissner effect. The ac suscep- tibility measurements indicate nonbulk superconductivity at ambient pressure but bulk superconductivity at T * c ∼ 13 K at P ∼ 2 GPa in the x = 0.20 sample [Fig. ]. In the x = 0.25 sample, the gradual development of a Meissner signal below T on c ∼ 30 K and the SC transition suggested by a broad peak at around T * c ∼ 14 K in the temperature derivative of the Meiss- ner signal are observed [Fig. ]. Note that the Meissner signal saturates at low temperatures, indicative of bulk super- conductivity in these samples.

To detect a site-selective electronic state in the inhomogeneous state, we measured the 31 P nuclear spin- lattice relaxation rate 1/T 1 across the resonance signal.

We measured 1/T 1 at the sharp and broad peaks shown by the solid black and dashed red arrows, respectively. Figure shows the temperature dependence of (T 1 T ) −1 at those peaks. (T 1 T ) −1 measured at the sharp peak continues to in- crease down to T c , indicative of the absence of a magnetic order at T N , but (T 1 T ) −1 at the broad peak shows a kink at T N , indicative of the presence of a magnetic order. These re- sults suggest that the sharp (broad) NMR peak arises from the region where P concentration is slightly higher (lower) than x = 0.25. Thus, the two-peak structure around T on c is as- cribed to the spatial distribution of the P concentration, since the variation in T N is very steep against the P concentration, as seen in Fig. .","0"

The aver- age of the internal field is related to the magnitude of the ordered moment, which is the order parameter of the AFM state.

The magnetic structure changes from a com- mensurate structure to an incommensurate structure (SDW type) with the P substitution. The averaged internal field H int at the P site is coupled with the ordered moment M as H int = A hf M with the hyperfine coupling constant A hf ∼ 0.32 T/µ B .

The competition between the magnetic and SC order pa- rameters as well as the spatial coexistence are common fea- tures of the ""122"" compounds. It thus seems that the re- lationship between the magnetic and SC phases is differ- ent between the ""1111"" and ""122"" compounds. The spatial coexistence is also realized in heavy-fermion superconduc- tors, whereas the nature of coexistence differs from that in BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2 , i.e., magnetism and superconductivity oc- cur at different parts of the Fermi surfaces. For example, it was reported that the spatial coexistence is observed microscopi- cally in CeCo(In 1−x Cd x ) and CeRhIn 5 at a certain pres- sure, where T N is higher than T c . In these compounds, the magnetically ordered moments develop below T N ; how- ever, they become constant below T c without further change at low temperatures. This suggests that magnetism and su- perconductivity emerge from different parts of the Fermi sur- faces, thus a single 4 f state could satisfy the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity. The suppression of the or- dered moments below T c was not observed in the U-based su- perconductor UPd 2 Al 3 or UNi 2 Al 3 , where plural 5 f electrons are subdivided into localized and itinerant electrons. This is also the case in ferromagnetic superconductors, such as UGe 2 , URhGe, and UCoGe. In contrast, the suppres- sion of the ordered moments below T c can be well understood by the assumption that the same Fermi surfaces contribute to both magnetic ordering and superconductivity with a compet- itive relationship. In BaFe 2 (As 1−x P x ) 2 , cylindrical Fermi surfaces, particularly hole Fermi surfaces, are modified to be more three-dimensional, and nesting between hole and elec- tron Fermi surfaces becomes weaker with P substitution, re- sulting in the suppression of the AFM order. It is considered that the nesting vector becomes distributed and the AFM or- der (superconductivity) occurs at stronger (weaker) nesting vectors. In this regard, the competitive relationship between the two phases might have a common aspect with that in cuprate superconductors, whose AFM order is induced by the applied strong magnetic field that imposes the vortex lat- tice.","0"

Much of the recent work has con- centrated on local moment systems where novel proper- ties such as cooperative paramagnetism , partial, non- collinear antiferromagnetic ordering , spin-freezing , and dipolar ""spin-ice"" behavior have been ob- served. There has, however, been growing interest in the interplay between itinerant and local moments in geo- metrically frustrated systems. The metallic pyrochlore Nd 2 Mo 2 O 7 exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect which has been attributed to the Berry phase produced by spin chirality on the pyrochlore lattice , while the spinel compound, LiV 2 O 4 has been claimed to represent the first known transition metal heavy-fermion system and evidence exists that the unusual properties of this mate- rial are related to geometrical frustration on the spinel lattice. A vast body of work has been carried out on 3d and 4d transition metal pyrochlores. These are generally in- sulators and possess either a spin-glass-like or long-range ordered magnetic structure. In contrast, the 5d transition metal pyrochlores are mainly metallic, resulting from the extended nature of the 5d orbitals. The exception to this is Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 where the 5d 3 configuration of Os 5+ results in a half-filled t 2g band and a metal-insulator transition at 226 K. Despite the large number of transi- tion metal compounds which crystallize in the pyrochlore structure and the wide range of physical phenomena ob- served in these materials, superconductivity had not been observed until the recent discovery of bulk superconduc- tivity in the 5d pyrochlore, Cd 2 Re 2 O 7.","0"

Recent inves- tigations have demonstrated the ex- istence of two phase transitions in this compound. The first, occurring at a temperature of about 200 K, is a continuous structural transition which is accompanied by drastic changes in resistivity and magnetic suscep- tibility . On further lowering the temperature, Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 has been shown to exhibit bulk superconduc- tivity below a sample dependent transition temperature of about 1 K . Preliminary measurements in the superconducting state indicate that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is a type-II superconductor with H c1 less than 0.002 T and estimates of the upper critical field, H c2 , ranging from 0.2 T to 1 T . None of the measurements reported to date extend below 0.3 K (T /T c ∼0.3) and hence, little can be concluded about the symmetry of the order parameter in this system. An exponential form of the specific heat as T approaches zero was speculated by Hanawa et al. but they point out that measurements to lower temperatures are clearly needed. We report the first measurements on Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 below 300 mK, tem- peratures which are necessary (for T c ∼ 1 K) to extract information about the superconducting order parameter symmetry. We have performed transverse field (TF) and zero field (ZF) muon spin rotation (µSR) measurements on single crystal samples of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . The ZF-µSR measurements reveal very small internal magnetic fields which are characteristic of nuclear dipoles, indicating no significant electronic magnetism either above or below T c . The TF-µSR results provide the first measurement of the internal field distribution in the vortex state in this material. In particular, temperature dependent studies from 20 mK to 4 K indicate a penetration depth which levels off as T → 0, suggestive of a fully gapped Fermi surface with a rather large zero temperature value of the penetration depth, λ(0)∼7500Å.","1"

Since the weakening of the superconduc- tivity is the fundamental feature of the 1/8 anomaly in the La-based cuprates, the present result clearly speaks for the 1/8-anomaly origin of the 60-K plateau. Fur- thermore, comparisons of the Hall coefficient R H and a- axis thermopower S a of 60-K YBCO to those of LSCO at x=0.12 strongly suggest that the hole doping is in fact 1/8 for y ≃ 6.65; Figs. 6(b) and 6(c) show such comparisons in R H (T )e/V 0 (V 0 is the volume per Cu in the plane) and S a (T ), which demonstrate that LSCO at x=0.12 and YBCO at y ≃ 6.65 show quite similar val- ues near room temperature, and these parameters have been proposed to be good indicators of the hole doping in cuprates . Therefore, it appears that in the 60-K plateau the hole doping is actually ∼1/8 and the super- conductivity is weakened, which together mean that the 60-K plateau is a manifestation of the 1/8 anomaly. It is useful to note that a reasonably good case for the connec- tion between the plateau and the 1/8 anomaly was made previously in a complementary way, using Ca doping . It should however be noted that static charge stripes (a sort of charge density wave that localizes the carriers) do not appear to be the fundamental ""cause"" of the weak- ening of the superconductivity in YBCO, since there is no evidence for static stripes in YBCO. It is of course possible that the impact of the stripes at the 1/8 doping varies depending on the level of dynamics of the stripes in various cuprate systems. A more interesting possibil- ity is that a proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP) is the more fundamental cause of the 1/8 anomaly: Recently, Aeppli et al. reported that the magnetic response of the Nd-free LSCO (where there is also no ev- idence for static charge stripes) bears a signature of the quantum criticality. In our data, fluctuations seem to be enhanced near y=6.7 while the superconductivity is sup- pressed, which might also be an indication of a proximity to a QCP; if so, this particular QCP suppresses super- conductivity through enhanced fluctuations, rather than creates superconductivity.","0"

Re- cently, novel concepts on pairing symmetry of n-and p-type cuprates have come forward: a possible transition in pairing symmetry and/or a mixed symmetry order parameter. Our previous work in- volved La 2−x Ce x CuO 4−δ (LCCO) and Pr 2−x Ce x CuO 4−δ (PCCO) films grown directly on SrTiO 3 substrates. We found that at low Ce doping levels, λ −2 (T ) at low T was quadratic in T , but at higher dopings, λ −2 (T ) showed ac- tivated behavior. These results suggested a d-to s-wave pairing transition near optimal doping, as was also sug- gested by tunneling experiments on PCCO films. We have subsequently improved film quality by eliminating the interface between the film and substrate, by grow- ing PCCO films onto Pr 2 CuO 4 (PCO)/SrTiO 3 instead of directly onto SrTiO 3 . The insulating PCO layer is thought to lessen lattice mismatch between PCCO film and SrTiO 3 substrate, so that these films should be more homogeneous through their thickness. In fact, their nor- mal state resistivities are somewhat lower than those of unbuffered PCCO films for the same doping, x.

Residual variations in λ −2 (T ) at the 0.1% level are due, at least in part, to slow drift in the gain of the lock-in amplifiers used to measure current and voltage.

"1308","JPS081113707-CC","2","Fe-based superconductors discovered in 2008 have stimulated fundamental discussion on the mechanism of superconductivity. Among the Fe-based superconductors, 11 type compounds have the simplest structure consisting only of superconducting layers. On the other hand, the other Fe-based superconductors (111 type, 122 type, 1111 type, and so on) have a stacking structure with both superconducting layers and block layers. Thus, 11 type superconductors have been extensively studied in order to understand the mechanism of Fe-based superconductivity. The 11 type superconductor FeSe exhibits superconductivity with T c = 13K and its T c reaches 37K under high pressure (4-6 GPa). The pressure dependence of T c relates to the anion height from the Fe layers , and T c of FeSe increases with decreasing anion (Se) height by high pressure. Thus, 11 type superconductors have the potential of achieving a high T c . Additionally, T c of K 0.8 Fe 2 Se 2, composed of K intercalation between FeSe layers, also shows an abrupt increase above 30 K . For (LiNH 2 ) x Fe 2 Se 2 , the superconductivity exhibits a higher T c of 43 K . With an increase in the c lattice parameter and the separation between Fe-chalcogen layers, T c increases. Therefore, a change of Fe-chalcogen layer has a great impact on superconductivity. Recently, it was reported that a FeSe monolayer synthesized by MBE method shows superconductivity at 53 K . -GGA (spin-dependent generalized gradient approximation) calculations have predicted that a Dirac-cone state appears in a FeSe monolayer . The Dirac-cone states behind the superconducting state may substantially raise its T c . Furthermore, there are several reports where the T c of superconducting ultrathin films become higher than that of the bulk . Thus, an ultrathin film of 11 type compounds may show an abrupt increase in T c.","1"

Thus, the 11 type superconductors are ideal candidates for the fabrication of a superconducting monolayer film by the scotch-tape method. If we could obtain a monolayer or ultrathin film, it will give us a greater understanding of the superconducting mechanism. Additionally, a property which has not been observed for the bulk yet may appear by the thinning. Thus, we fabricated the thin films and measured the resistivities.","0"

"1314","JPS081113707-CC","8","Furthermore, the normal-state resistivities above T c show not only metallic properties but also semiconductivity. The normal-state resistivities for 65 and 100 nm slowly decreases with decreasing temperature while that for 15 nm and the bulk increases, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The broadening superconducting transition and the change from metallic to semiconducting behavior of each film are similar to the change of Fe 1+d Te 1-x Se x with increasing excess Fe composition . Therefore, the increase of the resistivity corresponds to weak charge carrier localization due to the excess Fe, which results in the broadening of superconducting transition for 65 nm and the bulk. The existence of the excess Fe makes the crystal inhomogeneous. Thus, the result for 100 nm, which shows metallic resistivity with sharpest T c , suggests that a homogeneous crystal with low excess Fe, originally part of the bulk, is cleaved and remains on the surface of the substrate incidentally. This indicates that a homogeneous crystal with low excess Fe can be obtained using the scotch-tape method and shows ideal superconductivity. On the other hand, the result for 65nm implies that a part of the crystal with some excess Fe remains on the substrate and its superconductivity is inhibited by the excess Fe. For 15nm, a part of the crystal with a large excess of Fe remains and the superconductivity is completely suppressed and changes from metallic character to semiconductivity. Additionally, we determined the upper critical field H c2 (T) curves of the thin film with 100 nm thickness for H/c axis and the H/ab plane from the temperature dependence of the resistivity under a magnetic field. The temperature dependence of the resistivity under a magnetic field is summarized in Fig. 3 for (a) the H/c axis and (b) H/ab plane. The temperature at which the resistivity reached zero was systematically suppressed with increasing magnetic field. We estimated H c2 (T) from the criterion of 90% of normal-state resistivity. From the comparison of H c2 (T) for the thin film with bulk, H c2 (T) curves of the thin film shift toward higher field than those of bulk. Moreover, we calculated the H c2 ab (0) and H c2 c (0) using the data from 0 to 7T and Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory : H c2 ab (0) = 134.3 T and H c2 c (0) = 90.6 T for the thin film, and H c2 ab (0) = 87.9 T and H c2 c (0) = 39.2 T for the bulk. We also estimated the irreversibility field from the criterion of 10% of normal-state resistivity, as shown in Fig 3(d): H irr ab (0) = 102.6 T and H irr c (0) = 45.6 T for the film, and H irr ab (0) = 53.9 T and H irr c (0) = 27.7 T for the bulk. The H irr for the film are much larger than that of the bulk and the previous reports . The anisotropy coefficients  determined from  = H c2 ab (0)/ H c2 c (0) were estimated to be 1.5 for the thin film and 2.2 for the bulk, respectively. The anisotropy coefficient  of the thin film shows more isotropic behavior than that of the bulk. We found that the film with the lowest T c exhibits more isotropic , high H c2 and H irr . In previous reports, the bulk sample with low excess Fe shows low T c than high excess Fe . Excess Fe induces the broadening T c , worse superconducting properties, and more anisotropic behavior than ideal FeTe 1-x Se x . Therefore, our results indicate that ideal FeTe 1-x Se x bulk should exhibit high superconducting performance with isotropic superconductivity and has an advantage to application.","0"

"1335","EPL0330153-CC","2","The puzzling properties of high-T c superconductors have stimulated recently extensive experimental and theoretical work in order to determine the actual symmetry of the order parameter. While in the BCS weak coupling theory, the penetration depth λ(T ) varies as exp(−∆/k B T ), a quadratic behavior λ(T ) ∼ T 2 was reported by many groups in YBCO thin films . Recently, in very high quality YBCO single crystals, a linear temperature dependence was measured up to 40 K . Such a variation, never observed so far in YBCO thin films , is consistent with the occurrence of nodes in the gap and may suggest a d-wave pairing mechanism . However other possible interpretations have been raised, both theoretically and experimentally, e.g. a possible proximity effect with a normal metal layer , or the sensitivity of a conventional BCS type λ(T ) to the oxygenation of the samples . Several reasons for the discrepancy observed between thin films and single crystals may be invoked: (i) within the framework of d-wave pairing, scattering due to im- purities or defects may change the linear temperature dependence into a quadratic one in thin films , where such defects would be more numerous. However T c should then also be affected, which is not the case . (ii) weak links, more likely to be present in thin films, may yield an effective penetration depth (larger than the intrinsic one) with a different temperature dependence . The penetration depth λ has been essentially measured in both single crystals and thin films by using surface impedance techniques at a single frequency . Such measurements actually measure the variation ∆λ(T ) = λ(T ) − λ(0), but without the knowledge of λ(0) on each sample, comparing the temperature dependence of various samples may not be significant. This paper reports for the first time, from high frequency transmission data, both an unambiguous linear temperature dependence of λ(T ) on high quality YBCO thin films, which is quantitatively the same as in single crystals , and simultaneously λ(0) ∼ 1750Å. We observe a quadratic temperature dependence on a lower quality sample, and λ(0) ∼ 3600Å. We suggest that this T 2 dependence in thin films is not a consequence of strong scattering (in contrast with Zn or Ni doped materials ) but is of extrinsic origin. The intrinsic dependence of λ(T ) at low temperature is linear.","0"
"1336","EPL0330153-CC","3","This linear dependence points plainly toward the existence of low energy excitations, but our results alone do not allow to identify them. A natural and popular explanation is that they are due to nodes in the gap arising from unconventional pairing of d-wave type , an interpretation also conveyed by SQUID experiments .

"1338","EPL0330153-CC","5","We have screened the samples from stray magnetic field, so that the residual field is less than 0.5 Gauss. For a film of thickness d (smaller than the skin depth in the normal state or the penetration depth in the superconducting state) deposited onto a substrate of index n, the transmission writes : where σ = σ 1 − iσ 2 is the complex conductivity of the film, Z 0 the impedance of free space and Z = 1/σd the impedance of the film. If in the energy and temperature range of interest σ 2 (T ) ≫ σ 1 (T ) and σ 2 dZ 0 1+n ≫ 1, we can write: where σ 110 is the normal 110 K conductivity of the film. We choose to normalize the trans- mission at 110 K because the ratio thus obtained is experimentally more reliable than the absolute value of the transmission. For simplicity we assumed σ 110 dZ 0 1+n ≫ 1 in (2). Thus, the measurement of T/T 110 yields an absolute value of λ(T ). The uncertainties on the λ(T ) value which arise when neglecting the interferences within the film and/or the substrate, and the effect of the finite film thickness with respect to λ(T ) have been estimated: the trans- mission is fairly insensitive to the interference effects at our frequencies as can be shown by comparing a complete expression for T to . Moreover, no significant change of the transmitted energy could be observed in the most sensitive range 440-550 GHz . The finite film thickness, yields an approximate 80Å overestimate of λ(T ) for d/λ(T ) ∼ 0.5. holds at low temperature (T ≤ 20 K) for all frequencies, but should break down at 40 K . Indeed, σ 1 (35 GHz, 40 K) ∼ 2 × 10 7 Ω −1 m −1 , a value likely larger than σ 2 (300 GHz). However we expect a strong decrease of σ 1 (T ) at 300 GHz .","0"

In previous papers, the correlation between the film quality in terms of transmission, width of the rocking curve and surface resistance has been established . This led us to select the films either from their surface resistance: R S ≤ 0.5 mΩ at 77 K and 10 GHz, or the width of their rocking curve ∆θ ≤ 0.5 • . The characteristics of our samples are listed in . Two types of films have been intentionally investigated.","0"
"1340","EPL0330153-CC","7","The first film (A1) is of poor quality with respect to the above criteria. The two others (B1 and B2) display either a low surface resistance or a narrow rocking curve. We show in and the normalized transmission of the A1 and B2 films respectively. Strong differences are observed, in particular for the residual transmission in the superconducting state. At T ≤ 0.5 T c , the transmission increases as ω 2 in sample B2, as expected from and as shown in the inset of . In sample A1, the data can be analyzed by adding a constant T 0 to the ω 2 term . We estimate T 0 from the 10 K data (see inset of . We compute λ(T ) from (2) for the three frequencies, assuming that T 0 in the case of A1, does not depend on temperature or frequency. The result of this analysis is shown on and for the samples A1 and B2. The 120, 330 and 510 GHz curves collapse, up to 40 K 5 for sample A1 and up to 55 K for sample B2. This confirms that the frequency dependent part of the transmission varies as ω 2 , and that σ 2 (ω, T ) ≫ σ 1 (ω, T ) in these temperature ranges. λ(0) is found to be 1750 ± 160Å for B2 and 3600 ± 200Å for A1. The uncertainty on λ(0) depends mostly on the accuracy on the σ 110 measurement, which is limited by the uncertainty on the film thickness (±100Å) and by the Van der Pauw technique. Finally the most striking result is the temperature dependence of λ(T ). For sample A1, we find as shown in the inset, a clear T 2 dependence, a fairly common result for thin films , associated with a very large value for λ(0). In contrast, for sample B2, we find a linear temperature dependence up to 50 K along with a much shorter λ(0). Such a linear behavior was similarly observed in film B1.","0"
"1341","EPL0330153-CC","8","We now discuss the implications of these results. We believe that they demonstrate clearly the extrinsic origin of the T 2 dependence found previously in thin films. Indeed they agree with a phenomenological expression λ 2 (T ) = λ 2 intr (T )+λ 2 extr (T ) as proposed by Hylton et al., with λ extr being for example the contribution of weak links (but our conclusions are obviously independent of this specific expression). When λ extr is the dominating contribu- tion as in our film A1 it may produce the T 2 dependence which is likely to change from sample to sample. Indeed, the data of Porch et al. (see inset of Fig. 3) are not the same as ours. On the other hand, for good enough films, λ extr gets negligible and we find the intrinsic behavior for λ(T ) which is linear, and is expected to be unchanged from films to crystals. The YBCO single crystals results of Hardy et al. are reported on Fig. 4, shifted to our λ(0) value. The excellent agreement between the two sets of data confirms the intrinsic nature of λ in film B2. We remark that the agreement between λ(T ) in two completely unrelated samples is a very strong result since, except for a coincidence, it eliminates any extrinsic explanation like poor surface effects or pair breaking due to magnetic impurities , for the interpretations of the linear dependence. However the nature of the low energy excitations is still unknown and it is also not yet clear whether they are linked to the planes or to the chains. Furthermore, the T 2 dependence appears in a film where the penetration depth is large. Our λ intr (0) is much shorter. It is larger though than λ ab (0) = 1450-1490Å derive by µSR , and consistent with λ a (0) = 1600Å provided by infrared reflectance data . We believe that most techniques do not provide as a straightforward determination as ours.","0"
"1342","EPL0330153-CC","9","Our results offer a solution to a previous uncomfortable situation arising in the d-wave interpretation of the experimental results for λ(T ). Indeed in order to explain the T 2 behav- ior in films together with the linear dependence in single crystals, theoretical calculations had to call for a high impurity concentration in films. But this implies a significant differ- ence between T c for films and crystals which is not observed. The proposed escape was to assume that the impurity concentration was rather low with a scattering very near the unitary limit, a very specific hypothesis. In this case T c could be little changed by impurities while the low T behavior of λ(T ) would be much more affected. Since our results show that the T 2 behavior is extrinsic, e.g. due to weak links , all the results become coherent with a reasonably low content of ordinary scatterers.","0"
"1343","EPL0330153-CC","10","In order to interpret quantitatively our results, it is convenient to make use of the sim-plified two-dimensional model of d-wave like pairing introduced by Xu et al. , where the gap has a linear dependence near the nodes and is constant elsewhere: , θ being the angle with respect to the node position on the Fermi surface and the rest of ∆(θ) being obtained by symmetry. The density of states is taken as constant. This model contains the essential physical ingredients to represent a general order parameter with d-wave symmetry, except for the possible effect of Van Hove singularities. The slope of λ(T ) at T = 0 is given by 2 ln 2/µ∆ 0 , however when ∆ 0 is calculated with a weak coupling assumption, the result can only be made to agree with experiment up to 20 K and it does not reproduce the remarkable linear behavior up to 55 K.","0"
"1344","EPL0330153-CC","11","A simple way to account for this feature is to incorporate strong coupling effects. This is justified on theoretical ground and is also consistent with experiments since for example tunneling data give an effective gap larger than what is expected from BCS theory.

Even more surprising is that this high-field MR changes its sign depending on the field direction, as is schematically drawn in the inset to . One can conceive a spin structure upon rotating the high magnetic field within the ab plane in the follow- ing way: the spins always keep the collinear arrangement and rotate as a whole, being almost perpendicular to the magnetic field . Our data show that the resistiv- ity goes down as the spin direction approaches one of the two equivalent spin easy axes (Cu-Cu directions) and in- creases at the spin hard axes (Cu-O-Cu directions) [inset to ].

The substrate temperature dependence of orientation and superconducting poperties were systematically studied. Good quality c and a-axis orientated films can be obtained on SrTiO 3 via changing the substrate temperature solely. On YSZ, films with good c-axis orientation can be grown, while it is hard to grow films with good a-axis orientation by changing substrate temperature alone. The highest T C0 is about 37K, which is found in the films grown on YSZ with a good c-axis orientation. For the films grown on STO, however, the highest T C0 is about 35.6K with a mixed orientation of c-axis and a-axis. In most of the superconducting films, the weak temperature dependence of the normal state resistivity, as characterized by small R(290K)/R(50K) ≤ 2 ratios, together with a weak localization behavior just above T C could be attributed to the essential scattering due to the localized electronic states.

There are also reports on superconductivity in Pr-123 , however, the bulk superconductivity of Pr-123, has to be independently verified and also the structure of superconducting Pr-123 has to be confirmed by rigorous crystallography. Optical study has shown that PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ is a charge transfer type insulator with a charge- transfer gap ∆ CT ∼1.4 eV, and carriers in the chain are localized at low temperatures and low frequencies . Due to the depletion of mobile carriers, the in-plane electric transport properties in Pr-123 could be described in terms of variable range hopping (VRH) in the insulating region . When the high-temperature cuprates are doped with P r the superconductivity is usually suppressed , and often a metal-insulator transition occurs, accompanied by the presence of complicated magnetic behavior due to the relatively large magnetic moment of Pr ions . The origin of the suppression of superconductivity in HTSC by Pr and absence of superconductivity in Pr-123, being of fundamental interest, may also shed light on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, since any reasonable theory should explain the effect of Pr on superconductivity in 123 systems.","0"

A substitution of divalent element such as Ca for Pr appears to be a natural choice. Nevertheless no superconductivity was found in the samples with fairly low Ca doping levels (less than 30% at ambient pressure). Norton et al. successfully revived superconductivity in Pr-123 epitaxial thin films by substituting 50% of the tetravalent Pr by divalent Ca . And later, superconductivity was again found in high-pressure synthesized Ca-doped Pr-123 bulk samples . However, the influence of crystal structures on superconductivity in the thin films is still somewhat ambiguous. For example, it is necessary to study the superconductivity in films with different orientations systematically. And also it is important to make a comparative study of the transport properties of thin films and that of ceramic bulk samples. The transport properties of Ca-doped Pr-123 bulk samples sintered at ambient pressure have been studied by Luszczek . However, researches are harassed by the limited Ca substitution levels and no superconductivity was observed. Whereas, for the samples synthesized at high pressures, impurity phases seems hard to be avoided, although the Ca content is highly improved .

The sintering temperature was 930 • C. The whole process was carried out in air under an ambient pressure. Powder X-ray diffraction indicated a predominant R-123 phase while a small amount of BaCuO 2 could also be detected. The Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ epitaxial thin films were grown using pulsed-laser ablation mainly on the substrates of SrTiO 3 (STO) and Yttrium-stabilized ZrO 2 (YSZ). Some LaAlO 3 (LAO) and (LaAlO 3 ) 0.3 -(Sr 2 AlTaO 8 ) 0.7 (LSAT) substrates were also used. A silicon heater was utilized in the film deposition, and the temperature was monitored by an infrared thermodetector with a calibrated temperature range from 300 • C to 1200 • C. A self-made NiCr-NiAl thermocouple was placed at the back of the heater as a temperature reference. A LPX 300 KrF (λ =248 nm) excimer laser (Lambda Phyisk) was adopted for the film growth. The repetition rate was 5 Hz and the fluence was about 2 J/cm 2 . The target- substrate distance was kept at 70 mm. The films were deposited in an oxygen partial pressure of 40 Pa, as frequently seen in the growth of YBCO. After deposition, a one- minute holding before annealing was used for the purpose of stress relaxation. The annealing process was carried out in 1 atm oxygen at a cooling rate around 15 o C/min for about 10 minutes (The superconductivity of the film was found hardly dependent on the annealing duration at this circumstance).

On STO, films with c-axis lying in the film plane (a-axis oriented) can be obtained by decreasing the substrate temperature T S for about 160 o C, as compared with that for films with c-axis perpendicular to the film surface (c-axis oriented). Typical XRD patterns for films with c and a-axis orientation, grown at a temperature of 880 o C and 720 o C, are shown in and , respectively.

The error bar of T Conset and T C0 corresponds to the temperature scope from 100% to 90% of ρ n , and 10% to 0 (within the resolution of the instruments used) of ρ n , respectively. Here ρ n is the normal state resistivity, defined as the value where the sample resistivity deviates from the linear temperature dependence near the superconducting transition. The relationship of T C and T S for the films on YSZ is also shown. A higher T S is necessary to grow epitaxial thin films on YSZ than on STO, due to the larger lattice mismatch of the former. Accordingly, T C for the films on YSZ is higher, which could also be due to a larger strain at the interface. The highest T C0 is about 35.6 K and 37 K for the films grown on STO and on YSZ, respectively. It is worthy to notice that on STO, films with higher T C0 are those with a structure of mixed c-axis and a-axis oriented phases, as was reported earlier by Norton et al. . For the films grown on YSZ, the variation tendency of the measurement data seem to suggest a better superconductivity for the c-axis oriented films than those with a-axis orientation.","1"

Sintering the bulk materials under high pressure can raise the Ca substitution level to 70%. Superconductivity exhibits in bulks with Ca doping level from 30% to 70%, as mentioned previously in the literature . However, the superconducting bulk materials became insulating after fired in a furnace in air at a temperature higher than 200 o C for half an hour .

However, the film has a smaller resistivity just above T C , ρ(T | T C ) = 357 µΩcm. From the graph we can see that the transport behavior is metallic at high temperatures, but at temperatures just above T c, the resistance has a very small enhancement. This should not be a contribution from the resistance along c-axis direction, since in the film a-axis oriented phase can be fully ruled out according to the XRD data. We would rather attribute the effective enhancement to some kind of weak localizations, although at present we do not have enough evidence to determine what kind of localization it is. We propose that in the film there are some localized charge carriers, so the small enhancement is the combined result of the free carriers itinerating and the localized carriers variable range hopping.","0"

Before the superconducting transition, resistivity of these films raises slightly, suggesting a weak carrier localization. The small resistivity slope and the localization-like behavior near the superconducting transition temperature, which are often observed in 50% Pr doped YBCO, are almost independent of the magnetic field strength, as being noticed from the resistivity data at B ≤ 10 T. The weak localization behavior could be attributed mainly to the low carrier density, as having been well shown in the underdoped YBCO and La 1−x Sr x CuO 4 systems. In fact, Hall measurements carried out in 50% Ca-doped samples shows an in-plane carrier density lower than that in the optimum-doped YBCO . The weak temperature dependence of normal resistivity indicates an important scattering to the electron from the localized states in the present system. The disorder of Ba and Pr elements could contribute to such localized states, which is possible in the present film grown in an oxygen partial pressure of 40 Pa. The Pr ions may substitute for Ba in the lattice, similar to the Nd and Ba disorder observed in Nd 1+x Ba 2−x Cu 3 O 7 films grown at oxygen partial pressures higher than 1 bar .","0"

Another feature we have noticed is that the small enhancement of the resistivity near T C is weakened in the mixed orientation films, and shows a nearly linear temperature dependence of the resistivity as illustrated by the 'mixed oriented' line in .

"1409","xing2014theAnomaly-CC","13","To further verify the localization tendency of Cu doped electron, which is different with the Co/Ni substitution with less change of lattice parameter for Cu doping (as shown in ), we measured the electronic structure by using APRES technique in order to get a straightforward electronic structure picture of Cu doped LiFeAs. It has been experimentally proven that the surface of LiFeAs preserves its bulk properties. Therefore ARPES reflects the intrinsic properties for the LiFeAs crystals. Previously ARPES were used to study the Fermi surface evaluation when Fe is partially substituted by Co . The results show that Co substitution introduces electron type charge carriers and results in chemical potential shifting upwards, indicating electron doping. The Fermi surface (FS) mappings along the -M high symmetry line from ARPES for undoped and Cu 6% doped LiFeAs are shown in figures 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. To check how FSs change with Cu substitution, extracted k F locus were plotted in figures 5(a), 5(b) and 5(e), respectively. Red circles and green triangles represent undoped and Cu 6% doped Li(Fe 1−x Cu x )As, respectively. The results reveal no significant difference in these two different crystals, except for the small hole FS observed in LiFeAs, which disappeared in the Cu 6% doped Li(Fe 1−x Cu x )As, indicating small electron doping effect. Additionally, the normal state (T = 30 K) high resolution ARPES intensity plots along the -M high symmetry line are shown in figures 5(c) and 5(d), respectively. The incident light was set to 51 eV (k z = 0) with its polarization perpendicular to the mirror plane to select odd symmetry orbitals. Red and green solid circles were used to extract the band dispersion, which generates the small hole FS in LiFeAs. It is clear that the extracted band crosses E F in LiFeAs but sinks below E F in Cu 6% sample. Our results show that, unlike Co and Ni substituted LiFeAs , where extra electrons cause Fermi level to shift, the FSs of Cu substituted LiFeAs remained almost intact. Hence, the 3 d electrons from Cu dopant in LiFeAs are more localized and contribute little to the FSs. Berlijn et al studied disorder effects of Co and Zn substitution in Ba122 system . They found that the calculated Femi surface behaviors of Zn substitution induced deep impurity level that is quite different from the effect of Co doping. Recently Ideta et al reported strong localization effects in Zn substituted BaFe 2 As 2, wherein all the extra electrons are localized at the state of ∼10 eV below FSs and do not contribute to the chemical potential shift at all . Our results can be explained from the d-band partial density of states of Co, Ni and Cu in iron based superconductors. The behavior of Co or Ni substitution follows a rigid band model due to the fact that the d-bands of Co and Ni overlap with Fe d-band and are featureless compared with Fe d-band; whereas Cu presents deeper impurity potential of ∼4 eV , which localizes most of the Cu 3 d orbital electrons. This is consistent with the lesser contraction of lattice parameters","0"

"1411","xing2014theAnomaly-CC","15","Here we found that Cu doping results in the sinking of the small hole band below E F in LiFe 0.94 Cu 0.06 As which contributes to approximately only 1% mobile electron carriers(normalized to 0.17 electron / Cu doping). Therefore, the Cu doping is more localized in LiFeAs system and quantitatively different from Cu doped other systems . For example, the practical doped mobile carriers in Ba(Fe 1−x Cu x ) 2 As 2 are about 1 electron per Cu as calculated from the change of the Fermi Surface volume, which is much higher than 0.17 electron per Cu in our LiFeAs system.","0"

Since Ru is isovalent to Fe (within the same column in periodic table), Ru doping will not introduce carriers theoretically. The experiments of ARPES verified that Ru is isoelectronic substitution .

We plotted the onset tem- perature of superconductivity, T onset c , and the transition width, ∆T c = T onset c − T c . The zero-resistance state is observed even in the narrow pressure range below P c . In the Fe-based superconductors, it is a controversial is- sue whether superconductivity can coexist with the AFM state. Since the resistivity is macroscopic measure- ment and is sensitive to superconductivity, it is generally difficult to discuss this issue. However, note that ∆T c is unusually wide below P c . In contrast, ∆T c becomes markedly sharper above P c . The minimum ∆T c is 0.75 K at 3.83 GPa. This indicates that the PM state fa- vors superconductivity and that the AFM state prevents the occurrence of superconductivity in SrFe 2 As 2 . The su- perconductivity with a wide ∆T c below P c implies non bulk superconductivity. The transition from the tetrag- onal structure to the orthorhombic one is of the first order. As seen in the inset of , the transition at T 0 is of the first order even close to P c . At high pres- sures and low temperatures, the pressure distribution is inevitable. If the transition at P c is of the first order, the pressure distribution is expected to induce phase separa- tion. We speculate that the observed superconductivity below P c originates from the phase-separated PM phase. This is supported by the fact that T onset c is almost in- dependent of pressure below P c . However, if the phase separation is realized at around P c , we expect the en- hancement of ρ at low temperatures at around P c owing to scattering at the domain boundary. As shown in , there is no anomalous behavior in ρ(35K) at around P c within experimental error.

This T max c is much lower than the T c ∼ 15-28 K achieved in the case of Ru, Ni and Co substitutions. Such a lower T c is attributed to a Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking effect. The latter is strongly suppressed by applied pressure, as shown herein, T c can be significantly enhanced by applying high pressures. In this work, we investigated the pressure effects on Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking in the BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 series. Around the optimal concentration (x opd = 0.11), all samples showed a substantial increase of T c as a function of pressure.

In the latter case, the emergent SC state must be robust against the impurity pair-breaking mechanisms associated with strain/stress caused by the chemical substitution . In this regard, some substitutions, have revealed a strong pair-breaking mechanism. In fact, superconductivity does not emerge in Mn and Cr substituted BaFe 2 As 2 despite their effectiveness in suppressing the SDW order . Moreover, the inexpressive maximum T c ∼ 5 K observed in BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 within a narrow range of Cu 2+ concentrations contrasts with T c ∼ 26 K observed for Co-substituted samples .

"1488","piva2015combined-CC","10","Cu-concentration is enough to shift the SDW/tetragonal-to- orthorhombic phase transition down to roughly 130 K. A closer inspection of the resistivity data around these transitions, presented in ), allows us to verify the expected splitting between the structural transition at T s ≈ 129 K and SDW transition at T SDW ≈ 127 K at ambient pressure . The values of T s and T SDW are in good agreement with the reported ones for BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 samples with the same Cu- concentration, measured by nuclear magnetic resonance and heat-capacity experiments . Upon increasing pressure, T s and T SDW are both suppressed but with different rates leading to an increase of the split between the transitions, as displayed in the T -P phase diagram shown in . A drop in the resistivity around 29 K (open symbols in ) starts to develop for P 2.8 GPa and evolves to a complete zero resistance state (ZRS) (solid symbols in figure 3(c) at P = 3.4 GPa. By increasing the pressure, the onset of T c ≈ 29 K remains nearly constant while the width of the SC transition becomes sharper. At P op ≈ 4.0 GPa a sharp SC transition is established with a T c ≈ 31 K. This value of T c is close to the maximum T c achieved in the pure BaFe 2 As 2 under pressure indicating that for this range of Cu- concentration and pressure, the Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking effect is completely suppressed by pressure. In fact, pressure is well known to lead to a screening of the local moments by enhancing their hybridization with the conduction electrons in many compounds . For pressures higher than P op ≈ 4.0 GPa, the onset of T c slowly decreases as a function of pressure and the ZRS disappears for P 8.4 GPa.","1"
"1489","piva2015combined-CC","11","The small suppression of the SC transition temperature as a function of field up to 9 T, shown in , is again in agreement with the high critical fields of this family of compounds . The magnetic field dependence of ρ ab (P , T ) at 1.8 K for several pressures for x = 0.02 is presented in . Interestingly, the normal state resistivity for this compound shows a negative MR that evolves into a positive one for P > 2.4 GPa. A positive MR with a H 2 - dependence is usually expected in the Fermi-liquid regime of normal metals. The negative MR in metals usually indicates the presence of a spin-dependent scattering mechanism that can be suppressed by magnetic field. The results presented in figures 2(e) and 3(e) suggest the presence a spin-dependent scattering mechanism that tends to be reduced by increasing the Cu-concentration or pressure. As the SDW magnetic character of the Fe 3d electrons is nearly unaffected by the magnetic field (not shown), we attribute this spin-dependent scattering mechanism to the Cu 2+ (s = 1/2) local moments shown by recent ESR experiments, which directly probe the Cu oxidation state . The ESR data are in contrast to previous reports based on ARPES, XAS and NMR measurements, which suggest that the Cu atoms are in the Cu 1+ oxidation state . However, the data reported here is consistent with a Cu 2+ spin-dependent scattering mechanism. Such mechanism is responsible for the impurity magnetic pair-breaking effect which can be strongly suppressed by the application of pressure, leading to the significant enhancement of T c , as seen in . As such, it is expected that the suppression of the Cu 2+ spin dependent scattering mechanism by pressure would also lead to a negative MR in the normal state, as observed at low temperatures for the x = 0.02 sample in figure 3(e). Furthermore, the local moment character of Cu 2+ is supposed to decrease as a function of the Cu-concentration given that BaCu 2 As 2 is a Pauli paramagnet . This assumption is consistent with the fact that OPD samples show a positive MR in the normal state indicating a tendency to a more Fermi- liquid-like behavior. In fact, it has been recently suggested that the electronic character of the Cu and the strength of the As-As inter-layer bonds both strongly change between weakly Cu-substituted BaFe 2 As 2 and pure BaCu 2 As 2 , perhaps via a first-order lattice instability such as a miscibility gap in the BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 system .","0"
"1490","piva2015combined-CC","12","In summary, we report a combined study of external pressure (P 10 GPa) and Cu substitution on BaFe 2 As 2 single crystals grown by in-flux technique. This study aimed to investigate the pressure effects on Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking in the BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 series for different Cu-concentrations. Around the optimal concentration x opd = 0.11, all samples showed a substantial increase of T c as a function of pressure, although, for the samples with concentrations slightly above the OPD limit, T c presented a dome-like shape with a maximum value around 8 K. Remarkably, the low concentration sample x = 0.02 showed a maximum pressure induced T c of about 30 K, which is comparable to the maximum T c 's found in the pure compound under external pressure. This result indicates that the Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking effect can be completely suppressed by applying pressure in the low concentration regime. Finally, we also found a magnetic field dependent scattering mechanism which leads to a negative MR at low temperatures and low pressures (P < 2.0 GPa) for x = 0.02. This negative MR evolves to a more Fermi-liquid-like positive MR as a function of pressure and/or increasing Cu- concentration as the Cu 3d electrons are supposedly loosing their local-moment character.","1"

These iron pnictide compounds can be classed into three types: (i) ""1111""-type ROFeAs (R = rare earth metal or alkaline-earth metal) , (ii) ""122""-type AeFe 2 As 2 (Ae = alkaline earth metal) and (iii) ""111""-type AFeAs(P) (A = Li, Na) . These compounds have a layered structure with a stack of alternating iron-pnictide and charge reservoir layers. The technique of high pressure has played a role in exploring new other iron-based superconductors and studying the superconducting mechanism . Soon after the discovery of superconductivity in LaO 1−x F x FeAs with T c ∼ 26 K , applying external pressure on the superconductor enhances T c up to 43 K . There is a spin density wave (SDW) transition in most of these undoped or slightly doped iron-based compounds. External pressure can suppress SDW transition and induce superconductivity, which is similar to the role of chem- ical doping. For LaFeAsO and BaFe 2 As 2 compounds, the SDW transition happens at about 150 and 140 K, respectively. When an external pressure is applied, the SDW transition temperature T SDW goes down and superconductivity subsequently emerges . When T c is pushed to a maximum value with pressure, it decreases at higher pressures. However, for doped RFeAsO 0.85 (R = Sm and Nd) , T c is suppressed monotonously with increasing pressure. It seems that the behavior of T c tuned by pressure is complex. In this work, we report the effect of pressure on the T c of ""111""-type superconductors.","1"

Mizuguchi et al. established the plot of T c dependence on the anion height for the typical Fe-based superconductors. The plotted data points exhibit a unique curve with a peak around 1.38 Å. T c would decrease when the anion height deviates from the peak value.

Although the relation between anion height and pressure was not given in that paper, with the data of angle and bond length at different pressures it can be deduced. The anion height can be obtained by the formula: h = d * cos(α/2), where h is the anion height, d the Fe-As bond length and α the As-Fe-As (two-fold) angle.

LiFeP and LiFeAs have similar tendencies of T c tuned by pressure and their pressure coef- ficients are close.

Results of these studies support that h P n is a key fac- tor for adjusting the nesting properties and T c . Between LaFePO (h P n = 1.12Å) and NdFeAsO 1−y (h P n = 1.38 A), T c increases with increasing h P n , while the T c of FeSe increases with decreasing h P n (h P n = 1.45 → 1.42 A).

The structural parameters under pressure for FeSe, NdFeAsO 1−y , and LiFeAs have already been in- vestigated. In NdFeAsO 1−y , h P n slightly decreases from 1.34 to 1.33Å under pressure. Note that this h P n at ambient pressure differs from that (1.38Å) reported by Lee et al. The decrease in h P n and the reduction in lattice constant are considered to suppress superconduc- tivity under pressure in NdFeAsO 1−y . 2) If we consider that the h P n = 1.34 − 1.38Å of NdFeAsO 1−y is the op- timum range for a high T c , the h P n of FeSe approaches it under pressure, and T c increases. In contrast, the h P n of LiFeAs deviates from the optimum range, and T c de- creases. In the case of LiFeAs, a FeAs 4 tetrahedron also deviates from the regular one under pressure. The change in h P n is likely the main factor in deciding the change in T c under pressure in NdFeAsO 1−y , FeSe, and LiFeAs.  In this context, if the h P n in ""21113"" systems decreases under high pressures, the increase in T c under pressure for Sr 2 VFeAsO 3 is reasonable because the h P n is high at ambient pressure. Interestingly, the T c and h P n of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3 are comparable to those of FeSe under pressure.

Synthesis and crystal structure of transition and rare-earth metal oxypnictides (phase 1111) and superconductors based on them 2.1 Methods of synthesis Rather many ways of obtaining LnOMPn 1111-oxypnictides and superconducting materials based on them have been proposed. These methods differ significantly by the choice of the initial reagents and the conditions of synthesis. Because the superconducting transition has now been reached only for materials based on iron-containing oxyarsenides LnOFeAs, we here mention the methods by which these systems can be obtained and which can be conditionally divided into several main groups (see ). All polycrystalline (PC) oxyarsenides are obtained using solid-phase synthesis (SPS). Either simple substances are used as reagents or precursors (binary or, more seldom, ternary phases) are first synthesized. Such precursors are most often binary arsenides or (and) metal oxides. The methods proposed differ in the number of stages, the temperature T and time t of annealing, and the composition of the atmosphere in which the experiment is carried out. The intermediate and final products are sometimes treated under pressure. As an illustration, we briefly present possible ways of obtaining neodymium-containing oxyarsenide NdO 1Àx F x FeAs; whose samples exhibit the critical temperature T c $ 50À51 K close to the highest record for this class of materials.","1"

Along with Nd ± Fe oxyarsenide as the main superconducting phase, the final products contained nonsuperconducting impurity oxide, fluoride, and arsenide phases. To obtain NdO 0:9 F 0:1 FeAs samples, the authors of used another set of reagents: NdFe 3 As 3 Nd 2 O 3 NdF 3 Nd. The pellets made of the mixture of these reagents were heated for an hour to 1350 ± 1400 C, kept at this temperature for 4 to 8 h, and then cooled in air.

A possible simple explanation of this result is as follows . The application of external pressure promotes an increase in the carrier concentration in the FeAs layer. But each superconducting oxyarsenide has its own optimum doping level corresponding to the maximum T c . Therefore, the initial T c increase with increasing the pressure can be explained for La 0:89 F 0:11 FeAs by the fact that the doping level of this sample is below ideal, whereas the CeO 0:88 F 0:12 FeAs doping level is close to the ideal and its compression leads to a decrease in T c.","1"

The oxygen (arsenic) and lanthanum atomic orbitals overlap to a much lesser degree.

It can be seen () that as a result of the interaction of these layers, the states of the metal-like LaO layers shift the energy scale down by $ 2 eV. Furthermore, due to the electron transfer from the LaO layer to the FeP layer, a notable filling of Fe 3d states is observed in the FeP layer, whereas a forbidden gap occurs in the LaO layer spectrum in the LaOFeP crystal.

A new type of high-temperature (T c $ 26À55 K) superconductors based on two related families of layered compounds was discovered: quaternary oxyarsenides of transition and rare-earth LnOFeAs metals of the 1111 phase and oxygen-free ternary AFe 2 As 2 arsenides of 122 phases. Effective methods of synthesizing these superconducting materials in poly-and single-crystal states were elaborated. Numerous studies of their properties were conducted, including structural, superconducting, and magnetic proper- ties. The computational methods of band theory were used to establish the features of the electronic structure and chemical bond, and the types of spin ordering and mechanical characteristics were estimated.","1"
"1683","ivanovskii2008newHigh","152","In particular, the structural (and magnetic) phase transi- tion is observed for the majority of the initial (undoped) 1111 and 122 phases as the temperature decreases; this effect is suppressed under doping. The principal conditions for the superconducting transition of initial (undoped) 1111 and 122 phases were determined. For 1111 phases, the condition of such a transition is the electron or hole doping, which is realized as a result of atomic substitutions (or the formation of lattice vacancies) predominantly in the molecular rare- earth-metal ± oxygen layers. On the other hand, the super- conducting transition of 122 phases turns out to be possible either under their hole doping or under external pressure. In the latter case, a record high increase in the critical transition temperature (DT c $ 29 K) was observed for 122 phases, reached when external pressure was applied. Another record-breaking result for this class of superconducting materials is an extremely high value of the upper critical field B c2 up to $ 300 T found for some 1111 oxyarsenide superconductors, which can be important for the generation of strong magnetic fields.","0"

Interesting experiments [79] on single-crystal BaFe 2 As 2 and Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 samples were carried out to study the anisotropy of the thermodynamic and electromagnetic prop- erties of these layered phases. In particular, the room- temperature magnetic susceptibility w turns out to be close to isotropic, but in the region of decreased temperatures (T < 85 K), its anisotropy was clearly pronounced: w jjc < w cc . For superconducting Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 , the mea- sured anisotropy coefficient of the upper critical field g H cc =H jjc , measured in [79], ranges from 2.5 to 3.5. Studies of the effect of external pressure on the properties of 122 phases have begun [271 ± 273]. For a superconducting single-crystal Ba 1Àx K x Fe 2 As 2 sample, it was found that T c linearly decreases as the pressure increases [271]. Conversely, for nonsuperconducting CaFe 2 As 2 , a transition to the super- conducting state (with the critical temperature below T c $ 12 K) was revealed [272, 273]. In recent paper [274], systematic studies of the pressure effect on the properties of undoped CaFe 2 As 2 , SrFe 2 As 2 , and BaFe 2 As 2 have been performed and their superconducting transition (Fig. 17b) was found. In the series CaFe 2 As 2 3 SrFe 2 As 2 3 BaFe 2 As 2 , the superconducting transition region is shifted towards higher pressures, and the pressure-induced T c value increases from $ 12 K for CaFe 2 As 2 to $ 29 K for BaFe 2 As 2 . The latter value (DT c $ 29 K) is the maximum ever obtained with the application of external pressure to superconductors [274]. The parameters of superconducting states of hole-doped 122 phases were discussed on the basis of optical spectroscopy data for Ba 0:6 K 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 [275] and Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 [276] and scanning tunnel microscopy for Sr 1Àx K x Fe 2 As 2 [277]. Some experiments were conducted to study the relation between the structural and magnetic characteristics of AFe 2 As 2 phases. From the optical spectroscopy data for SrFe 2 As 2 and EuFe 2 As 2 [270], a conclusion was drawn that these systems exhibit a spin instability and a pseudogap can be formed in their spectrum due to spin density waves. Accord- ing to the data of NGR spectroscopy for 57 Fe nuclei, obtained for BaFe 2 As 2 at T 298, 77, and 4.2 K [38], a long-range magnetic order exists in this crystal at T 4 77 K. The experimental results with the use of neutron diffraction on BaFe 2 As 2 [268] and CaFe 2 As 2 [278] have allowed assuming that their low-temperature (orthorhombic) phases involve a structure formed by magnetic moments of Fe atoms (Fig. 18a).

Until now, various Fe-based superconductors, such as ZrCuSiAs-type LnFeAsO (Ln stands for rare earth elements) -, ThCr 2 Si 2 -type AeFe 2 As 2 (Ae stands for alkali earth elements) , Fe 2 As-type AFeAs (A is Li or Na) -and anti-PbO-type Fe(Se, Te) , have been reported. The T c of anti-PbO-type FeSe could reach 37 K under 4.5 GPa from T c ⇠ 8 K at ambient pressure . Very recently, by intercalating K, Rb, Cs and Tl in between the FeSe layers, superconductivity was enhanced to about 30 K without any external pressure in the Fe-Se system -, and it provides a new type of iron-based superconductor to explore high T c . For the iron-pnictide, the pressure tends to destroy the magnetic transition in the undoped compounds, and T c increases with increasing pressure for underdoped iron-pnictides, remaining approximately constant for optimal doping and decreasing linearly in the overdoped range . Superconductivity can be induced via pressure in the parent compounds AFe 2 As 2 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu) -. Magnetism and superconductivity are strongly correlated with each other in iron-based superconductors. The strong pressure effect in FeSe may be related to its strongly enhanced antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations under pressure . Therefore, we wonder whether the strong pressure effect still exists in A x Fe 2 Se 2. It is very meaningful to carry out high-pressure measurements in these newly found superconductors.","1"

Two K x Fe 2 Se 2 single crystals with different T c were measured. For the K x Fe 2 Se 2 crystal with T onset c = 32.6 K and a broad hump centered at 245 K, T c gradually decreases with increasing pressure.

The maximum T c for the two batches of single crystals K x Fe 2 Se 2 is the same, and is reached at ambient pressure and 0.48 GPa, respectively. The difference in T c between the two batches of single crystal K x Fe 2 Se 2 is very small (just 1.5 K), while the temperature of the resistivity hump is 245 and 130 K, respectively. This indicates that the hump temperature strongly depends on the sample. The hump behavior could originate from the vacancy of Fe or Se. Another piece of evidence is that the normal state resistivity is very high compared with other iron-pnictide superconductors because the vacancy in conducting FeSe layers leads to a strong scattering and consequently high resistivity. This suggests that the physical behavior of A x Fe 2 Se 2 is very sensitive to the deficiency, and a change in the deficiency strongly affects the normal state resistivity although the T c does not change too much.","0"

It is thought that conductive carriers are confined two dimensionally in the FeAs layers and the carrier concentration can be increased by the substitution of O 2-by F -. The parent compound LaFeAsO is metallic and undergoes a structural phase transition at ~160 K and a magnetic phase transition at ~140 K. 2,3) The crystal structure changes from the tetragonal to orthorhombic, then the compound exhibits a spin density wave type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. The structural distortion and the magnetic ordering are suppressed by the F substitution, resulting in the emergence of the superconductivity. Right after the discovery of the superconductivity in LaFeAsO 1-x F x , it was reported that the T c of LaFeAsO 0.89 F 0.11 shows large pressure effect and increases to a maximum of 43 K at 4 GPa, suggesting that the lattice contraction is effective in the enhancement of the T c of oxypnictide compounds. 4) Actually, RFeAsO (R = rare earth) having smaller R atom than La atom shows the T c over 50 K. 5,6) It is known that external pressure can control carrier concentration in CuO 2 plane of high-T c cupper oxides.","1"

In this paper, we report a pressure-induced superconductivity in LaFeAsO with a maximum T c of 21 K.","1"

The sample was confirmed to be mostly composed of a single phase of the ZrCuSiAs-type tetragonal structure with lattice constants of a = 0.403268(1) nm and c = 0.874111(4) nm at room temperature. Electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 1.5 and 12 GPa were performed by a standard dc four-probe technique using a piston-cylinder type pressure cell and a cubic anvil cell, respectively. A liquid pressure-transmitting medium (Fluorinert FC70:FC77 = 1:1) was used to maintain hydrostatic conditions. A diamond anvil cell (DAC) made of CuBe alloy was used for electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 29 GPa. The sample chamber comprising a rhenium gasket was filled with powdered NaCl as a pressure-transmitting medium. 4) AC magnetic susceptibility measurements with AC field of 1.8 mT and a frequency of 317 Hz were carried out using the cubic anvil cell. shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of LaFeAsO using the piston-cylinder type pressure cell. The electrical resistivity of LaFeAsO shows a rapid decrease below ~150 K at 0 GPa. 1) This anomaly at ~150 K becomes broader with applying pressure. The temperature dependence of dρ/dT shows a peak at 145 K at 0 GPa, and the peak of dρ/dT shifts to lower temperature side by applying pressure, as shown in the inset of . From the results of powder X-ray diffraction measurement and nuclear magnetic resonance using the same batch sample as ours, it was reported that the structural phase transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic (Cmma) and the AFM ordering occur at ~165 and 142 K, respectively. The temperature T 0 at which dρ/dT shows the peak at 0 GPa is close to the AFM ordering temperature rather than the structural phase transition temperature. Therefore, the pressure dependence of the T 0 may be related to a suppression of the AFM ordering by applying pressure. Another remarkable anomaly of the electrical resistivity was observed under high pressure at lower temperatures.

The temperature at which the electrical resistivity begins to decrease, indicated by arrows in (a), shifts to the lower temperature and the electrical resistivity at 0 T below the temperature indicated by the arrows increases by applying magnetic field. The zero resistivity observed at 12 GPa disappears by increasing current density, as shown in . Thus, these results indicate that the sudden decrease of the electrical resistivity is reduced by applying magnetic field and by increasing current density. Moreover, a diamagnetic signal of AC magnetic susceptibility is detected below ~20 K at 9 and 12 GPa, as shown in . In this way, the magnetic field and the current effects on the electrical resistivity and the diamagnetic signal strongly suggest that the anomalous behavior in the electrical resistivity below 20 K is attributed to a pressure-induced superconductivity. The broadening of the superconducting transition below ~20 K is probably due to a sample inhomogeneity rather than a distribution of pressure, because a hydrostatic condition was kept unchanged during the measurements. The pressure-induced superconductivity have also been reported in Fe-As compounds having a ThCr 2 Si 2 -type tetragonal structure. The anomaly due to the pressure-induced superconductivity is also detected by the electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 29 GPa using the DAC, as shown in . In this measurement, the zero resistivity was not observed even in the highest pressure. The failure to observe the zero resistivity is probably caused by a nonhydrostatic compressive stress resulting from the use of a solid pressure-transmitting medium. We confirmed current dependence of the electrical resistivity below the transition temperature. The transition temperature increases by applying pressure to a maximum of 21 K, and decreases monotonically above 16 GPa.

This P-T phase diagram shown in is similar to x-T phase diagram for the F -substituted system, LaFeAsO 1-x F x . 1) In addition, the pressure dependence of T c in LaFeAsO is similar to those observed in the F-doped compounds, as shown in . The substitution effect of O 2-by F -in LaFeAsO is expected to lead shrinkage of lattice constants and change of carrier density, resulting in suppression of structural and magnetic phase transitions and enhancement of T c.","1"

This may be due to a magnetic instability existing close to superconducting phase. On the other hand, the maximum T c of 43 K in ""over-doped"" LaFeAsO 0.86 F 0.14 is comparable to that in ""optimum-doped"" LaFeAsO 0.89 F 0.11 although the T c of LaFeAsO 0.86 F 0.14 at 0 GPa is smaller than that of LaFeAsO 0.89 F 0.11 by 9 K. This result is in strong contrast to the case of high-T c cupper oxides. In high-T c cupper oxides, external pressure effect has an aspect of carrier doping effect, because carrier concentration in the CuO 2 layers increases by pressure through changing charge 8 distribution due to anisotropic compression. In this case, the T c of ""over-doped"" LaFeAsO 0.86 F 0.14 decreases with increasing external pressure. 18) Therefore, it is considered that the effect of external pressure on the electronic state of Fe-based superconductors is different with the case of high-T c cupper oxides.","1"

Mercury with its exceptionally low melting and boiling temperatures offered the best perspectives with respect to very low impurity levels. Heike Kamerlingh Onnes had built at the University of Leiden a unique cryogenic facility where he was able to achieve substantially lower temperature than any other laboratory. This led him in 1911 to his famous experiment to see how low one can go concerning electrical resistance. The observed sudden jump to apparently zero resistivity below 4 K came nevertheless as a big surprise. Kamerlingh Onnes immediately recognized it as indication of a new state of matter. In 1933, the discovery of Walter Meißner and Robert Ochsenfeld that magnetic fields are expelled from a superconductor, demonstrated that superconductivity is actually a true thermodynamical state since in contrast to the situation for a merely perfect conductor this expulsion is independent of the experimental history .","1"

Later on, he refined this idea to the concept of superconductivity as a macroscopic quantum state.","0"

In the first generation of SC materials (""type-I "") superconductivity was easily suppressed by magnetic fields: The self-field generated by the injected current prevented high-field as well as high-current applications. The first step towards this goal was the discovery of type-II superconductors where the magnetic penetration depth λ exceeds the SC coherence length ξ, a materials parameter that Pippard had introduced in 1950 to describe the nonlocal character of the SC state and which was later recognized as the average size of an electron pair. λ > ξ enables coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic fields which are allowed here to penetrate into the SC bulk in the quantized form of vortices of the size ξ.

"1764","hott2013review-CC","7","After 1930, SC materials research was more or less in a hiatus until Bernd T. Matthias and John K. Hulm started in the early 1950s a extensive systematic search that delivered a number of new compounds with high T c well above 10 K as well as technically attractive B c2 well above 10 T. The most prominent examples of this crop were NbTi (T c = 9.2 K) and the A15 materials, A 3 B type intermetallic compounds, the materials basis for todays SC wire industry. Having generated some 3000 different alloys in the 1950s and 1960s Matthias became a recognized wizard of the SC materials science. He condensed his huge practical knowledge into ""rules"" of how to prepare ""good"" superconductors: High crystal symmetry, high density of electronic states at the Fermi level, no oxygen, no magnetism, no insulators! In spite of his inofficial sixth rule ""Stay away from theorists!"", in 1957 the BCS theory brought up a desperately awaited breakthrough of theoretical solid state physics, a microscopic explanation of superconductivity. Due to the atomic bomb development, single isotope SC samples, e.g., mercury, had become available where the dependence of T c on the isotope mass pointed to a phonon-driven mechanism. John Bardeen realized that phonons introduce an attractive interaction between electrons close to the Fermi surface (""overscreening""). The key idea of BCS theory is that even a tiny attractive interaction between these electrons leads to the formation of bound electron pair states (""Cooper pairs""). The electrons in these paired states are no longer obliged to obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, which enforces the electrons to occupy high kinetic energy single particle states due to the Pauli principle. The energy gain of the SC state with respect to the normal state does not result from the small binding energy of the pairs but it is the condensation energy of the pairs merging into a macroscopic quantum state. This results in an energy gap for electron excitations into single particle states. Although the BCS theory was derived from the physical idea of attractive electron-phonon coupling, the model-based weak pair coupling theory as its mathematical essence is well applicable to other pairing mechanisms. BCS theory had an impact not only on solid state physics but also on elementary particle physics where it was further developed to the idea of the Higgs mechanism of elementary particle mass generation (origins, impact and current state of the BCS theory are reviewed in ).","1"
"1765","hott2013review-CC","8","In 1979, in violation of another Matthias rule, superconductivity was discovered in the magnetic material CeCu 2 Si 2 as the first representative of a new class of ""heavy-fermion"" superconductors where magnetism is suspected to be the mechanism responsible for the Cooper pairing:  In these intermetallic compounds the electronic degrees of freedom which are responsible for superconductivity are directly linked with magnetic moments of partially filled f-shells of lanthanide or actinide atoms. Superconductivity below a typical T c ~ 1 K seems to arise here from the delicate balance between the localized magnetic moments trying to imprint their magnetic signature on the shielding conduction electrons, and the conduction electrons which try to screen these magnetic moments by spin flipping, e. g., via Kondo effect .","0"
"1766","hott2013review-CC","9","The search for organic superconductors had been boosted in the 1960s by the idea that conductive polymer chains with polarizable molecular groups may provide for electrons running along the polymer chains a highly effective Cooper pair coupling by means of an energy exchange via localized excitons . Since the first discovery of an organic superconductor in 1980 remarkably high critical temperatures T c > 10 K have been achieved . However, the origin of superconductivity has turned out to be certainly far from the suggested excitonic mechanism. The electric conduction stems here from π-electrons in stacked aromatic rings which form one-or two-dimensional delocalized electron systems. This restriction of the effective dimensionality and strong Coulomb repulsion effects push the systems towards metal-insulator, magnetic and SC transitions (for a recent review see ).","0"
"1767","hott2013review-CC","10","The verdict of the Mermin-Wagner theorem that a long-range order can not exist in two dimensions at finite temperature due to the influence of fluctuations has long been believed to restrict superconductivity to the physical dimension d = 3. The cuprate ""high- temperature superconductors"" (""HTS"") discovered in 1986 proved that the limiting case d = 2+ε (ε→0), i.e., a scenario of basically two-dimensional CuO layer-oriented superconductivity with slight SC coupling to neighbouring CuO layers, can even be enormously beneficial for SC long-range order (the evolution of HTS is reviewed in ). The problem with the theoretical description of cuprate HTS within BCS theory and its extensions is not the high T c of up to 138 K under normal pressure , far above the pre-HTS record of 23 K : According to the McMillan-Rowell formula , a commonly used T c approximation for the BCS superconductors, this HTS T c range is readily accessible with reasonable materials parameters . The real problem is that, in contrast to the ""deep"" Fermi sea of quasi-free electrons in classical metals where the Cooper-pair condensed electrons amount only to a small part of the valence electron system (k B T c << E Fermi ), in these layered cuprate compounds there is only a ""shallow"" reservoir of charge carriers (k B T c ~ E Fermi ) which first have to be introduced in the insulating antiferromagnetic (""AF"") stoichiometric parent compound by appropriate doping. Moreover, these charge carriers turn out to be complex physical objects in which strong Coulomb correlations connect their internal charge and spin degrees of freedom and for which Landau's quasiparticle concept of a description in terms of quasi-free electrons ""dressed"" by screening charge clouds no longer applies . The normal charge transport based on these carriers corresponds to a ""bad/strange metal"" behaviour with a quite high electrical resistance which increases with temperature in a linear way without saturation up to the melting temperature, in stark contrast to the well-known saturating scattering behaviour of quasi-particles in a normal metal. Accordingly, the BCS recipe to express the SC wavefunction in terms of simple normal-metal single particle states does not work for cuprate HTS since the macroscopic many-particle wavefunction is thoroughly changing in the superconductive transition. Moreover, the strong connection of charge and spin degrees of freedom in the normal-conducting state paves the way for a plethora of other forms of broken symmetry, e.g. charge and spin density waves, which may compete or cooperate with superconductivity . A satisfactory theoretical description has not yet been achieved but the SC instability in cuprate HTS, as well as in the structurally and chemically related layered ruthenate and cobaltate compounds, is believed to stem predominantly from a magnetic and not from a phononic interaction as in the case of the classical metallic superconductors where magnetism plays only the role of an alternative, intrinsically antagonistic long range order instability.","1"

The superconductivity in C 60 introduced by doping and intercalation of alkali-metal atoms, with T c values up to 33 K at normal pressure , well above the pre-HTS record of 23 K [23] followed soon as another surprise. In spite of this high T c, the explanation of superconductivity seems to be well within reach of conventional BCS theory based on intramolecular phonons .","1"
"1769","hott2013review-CC","12","Borides had been investigated systematically with respect to high-T c superconductivity already in the 1950s. The rationale was the BCS T c -formula where a high characteristic phonon frequency, as provided by the light boron atoms, was predicted to be particularly helpful with respect to a high T c . In the 1990s, the borocarbide superconductors RE Ni 2 B 2 C (RE: Rare Earth element) with T c up to fulfilled this promise at least halfway. However, phonons are here only one of the candidates of contributing superconductivity mechanisms. For Rare Earth borocarbides there is additional magnetism due to localized RE 3+ 4f-electrons which is weakly interacting with superconductivity associated with the 3d- electrons of the Ni 2 B 2 layers. A huge surprise came in 2001 with the discovery of superconductivity up to T c = 40 K in MgB 2 , a compound which had been well-known since the 1950s and which was in 2001 already commercially available in quantities up to metric tons . As for the fullerides, in spite of the high T c a phononic mechanism is here highly plausible: Coulomb correlation effects do not play a role since the conduction electron system involves neither inner atomic shells nor a reduction of the effective dimensionality. A new feature, multiband superconductivity, i.e., the coherent coupling of the Cooper-pair instabilities of several Fermi surfaces turned out to be essential for the theoretical description of the SC properties . This multiband mechanism plays an even more dominant role in iron-based supercon- ductors where the scattering between the Fermi surfaces of up to five Fe-derived electronic bands is apparently the origin of a complicated magnetic superconductive coupling mechanism . In contrast to the cuprate HTS the parent compounds are here metals with a spin-density wave long-range magnetic order. LaFePO, the first representative of this SC materials family was discovered in 2006 but did not gain much attention due to its comparatively low T c = 5 K. T c = 26 K, however, observed two years later for the next iron pnictide compound LaFeAsO started a ""gold rush"" resembling the cuprate HTS situation twenty years before: T c was immediately pushed up to 55 K . The iron chalcogenide FeSe with a bulk-T c = 8 K attracted only little attention as a structural oddity representing the irreducible SC basis structure of a combined iron-based superconductor family until recently T c up to 109 K was achieved in a FeSe monolayer on a SrTiO 3 substrate It is still under debate whether this high T c is an intrinsic FeSe bulk property or due to interface superconductivity of the quasi 2d electron gas at a polar interface as it was first observed for ultrathin LaAlO 3 films on SrTiO 3.","1"
"1770","hott2013review-CC","13","Finally, the longstanding quest for room-temperature superconductivity has met with success: The observed superconductivity in hydrogen sulfide up to a temperature of 203 K is able to fulfill this promise, at least in a room in Antartica at a very high pressure ~100 GPa!  As a success of conventional phonon-based first-principles theory this experimental result had even been predicted and a posteriori reproduced with amazing accuracy in more refined calculations . In these experiments with sulfur-hydride and recently also with phosphorous-hydride with T c up to ~100 K the high pressure is obviously required in order to destabilize the starting compound. As a proof of principle these results revive hopes for high-temperature superconductivity mediated by high-energy hydrogen-based phonons . Nevertheless, they can not be easily translated into a recipe for the preparation of technically useful materials where chemical pressure stabilizes superconductivity even under regular ambience conditions. This caveat holds true even more for the induction of transient superconductivity up to a temperature of 300 K under intense infrared or terahertz frequency pulse illumination as recently reported for the strongly underdoped cuprate HTS YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-δ (""YBCO"") and for similar experiments on the cuprate HTS La 1.675 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.125 CuO 4 and La 1.875 Ba 0.125 CuO 4 as well as on K 3 C 60 . Even accepting the spectroscopic evidence as experimental criterion for the presence of superconductivity as a thermodynamic bulk state, it is on the one hand clear that the involved dynamical process can not be directly mimicked by any materials design. On the other hand, the details of the concluded mechanism of an antagonistic interplay between superconductivity and charge (density wave) order are still under debate: Recent experiments on TiSe 2 as model substance for a study of this interplay under well-defined electric-field controlled doping conditions demonstrate a spatial texturing of superconductivity indicating a complicated local phase separation scenario .","1"

The intercalation of superconductive CuO chain layers in-between the CuO 2 /Ca/CuO 2 bilayer stacks is most likely the origin of the strong Josephson coupling between these bilayer stacks. This explains the remarkable reduction of the superconductive anisotropy in c-axis direction compared to all other HTS families. Moreover, in contrast to the usually isotropic SC behavior within the a-b-plane, the CuO chains seem to introduce a substantially higher SC gap in b-compared to the a-direction .

"1788","hott2013review-CC","31","HTS are extreme type-II superconductors with λ > 100 nm and ξ ~ 1 nm. The quasi- 2-dimensional nature of superconductivity in HTS leads to a pronounced anisotropy of the SC properties with much higher supercurrents along the CuO 2 planes than in the perpendicular direction and a corresponding anisotropy of λ, e.g., λ ab = 750 nm and λ c = 150 nm in YBCO (the indices refer to the repective orientation of the magnetic field). Material imperfections of the dimension of the coherence length which are required as pinning centers preventing the flux flow of magnetic vortices are easily encountered in HTS due to their small coherence lengths, e. g., for optimally doped YBCO ξ ab = 1.6 nm, ξ c = 0.3 nm for T → 0 K which are already comparable to the lattice parameters (YBCO: a = 0.382 nm, b = 0.389 nm, c = 1.167 nm ). The high T c in combination with the small value of coherence volume (ξ ab ) 2 ξ c ~ 1 nm 3 allows large thermally induced magnetic fluctuations in the SC phase at temperature close to T c, an effect which could completely neglected in classical superconductors . Moreover, since technical superconductor materials consist of a network of connected grains, already small imperfections at the grain boundaries with spatial extensions of the order of the coherence length lead to a substantial weakening of the SC connection of the grains and thus to a ""weak-link behavior"" of the transport properties.","0"

Nowadays, the effect is used to generate electrmagnetic radiation in the THz range . If the thickness of the charge reservoir blocks EO/(AO x ) m /EO in-between these stacks is larger than ξ c vortices are here no longer well- defined due to the low Cooper pair density (see ). This leads to a quasi-disintegration of the vortices into stacks of ""pancake vortices"" which are much more flexible entities than the continuous quasi-rigid vortex lines in conventional superconductors and require therefore individual pinning centers. The extent of this quasi-disintegration is different for the various HTS compounds since ξ c is on the order of the thickness of a single oxide layers, e.g., d TlOx = 0.2 nm for the Tl-HTS . Hence the number of layers in the charge reservoir blocks EO/(AO x ) m /EO makes a significant difference with respect to the pinning properties and thus to their supercurrents in magnetic fields. This is one of the reasons why YBCO (""Cu-1 212"") has a higher supercurrent capability in magnetic fields than the Bi-HTS Bi-2 212 and Bi-2 223 which for manufacturing reasons have been for a long time the most prominent HTS conductor materials.

In addition, oxygen depletion and thus T c reduction may occur at grain boundaries Another obstacle for supercurrents in HTS (which is detrimental for transport currents, but also enables the fabrication of HTS Josephson junctions) is misalignment of the grains: Exponential degradation of the supercurrent transport is observed as a function of the misalignment angle (see ). One of the reasons for this behavior is the d-symmetry of the SC order parameter (see ) . However, the J c reduction as a function of the misalignment angle α turns out to be much larger than what is expected from d-wave symmetry alone . This extra J c degradation as well as the change of the current- voltage characteristics of the transport behavior were believed to arise from structural defects such as dislocations and deviations from stoichiometry, in particular the loss of oxygen at the grain surfaces and the concomitant local degradation of the SC properties due to the decreased doping (see ) . A recent microscopic modeling identified the build-up of charge inhomogeneities as the dominant mechanism for the suppression of the supercurrent .","0"

Hence, in analogy with the cuprate HTS, where on doping the AF ground state of the parent compounds seems to ""dissolve"" in spin-singlet Cooper pairs in a d-wave orbital channel, it was suggested that the superconductivity in Sr 2 RuO 4 is brought about by spin-triplet pairing where the Ru ions ""release"" parallel-spin, i.e., triplet Cooper pairs in p-wave or even higher odd order angular orbital channels.","1"

This picture has been confirmed in detail by deHaas-vanAlphen and photoemission studies . The strongly renormalized quasiparticles can be described by a semiphenomenological ansatz, the Renormalized Band Method which yields realistic quasiparticle bands .

Despite the efforts to implement modern many-body methods for strong correlations into realistic electronic structure calculations there is still no general concept for quantitative microscopic correlations.

The subtle interplay between local singlet-formation via Kondo effect and long-range magnetic order can be monitored experimentally in pressure studies where isostructural relatives of the HF superconductors are tuned from magnetic phases at ambient pressure to SC states, e. g., CeCu 2 Ge 2 , CePd 2 Si 2 CeNi 2 Ge 2 and CeRh 2 Si 2 , CeSn 3 and CeIn 3 (see ) .

There is experimental evidence for a new kind of magnetic pairing mechanism mediated by propagating magnetic exciton modes. The sister compound UNi 2 Al 3 is an example of coexistence of large moment antiferromagnetism with a SC triplet order parameter. In URu 2 Si 2 the SC order parameter symmetry is still undetermined.

The oldest cubic U-HF superconductor UBe 13 and its thorium alloy U 1-x Th x Be 13 is also the most mysterious one. While for the pure system there is a single SC phase of yet unknown symmetry, in the small Th concentration range two distinct phases exist which may either correspond to two different SC order parameters or may be related to a coexistence of superconductivity with a SDW phase. In addition, in UBe 13 SC order appears in a state with clear non-Fermi liquid type anomalies. More recently the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in UGe 2 has been found.

"1836","hott2013review-CC","79","The hexagonal heavy fermion compound UPt 3 (see ) is the ""flagship"" of unconventional superconductivity, despite its rather low critical temperature of slightly less than 1 K. It is set aside from all other unconventional superconductors insofar as it exhibits two SC phase transitions. The exciting discovery of the split superconductive transitions in UPt 3 at T c1 = 530 mK and T c2 = 480 mK in specific heat measurements has led to an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work on UPt 3 . The additional small moment antiferromagnetism observed in UPt 3 (T N = 5.8 K, µ = 0.035 µ B ) plays a key role in the identification of the SC order parameter since the in-plane staggered magnetization acts as a symmetry breaking field (SBF) to the SC multicomponent order parameter. The SBF is believed to be responsible for the appearance of two SC transitions which otherwise would merge into one. Therefore one can identify three distinct SC phases. Despite the wealth of experimental results on UPt 3 there is no unequivocal consensus on the symmetry and node structure of the SC gap. UPd 2 Al 3 (see ) is a rather special case among the U-based HF superconductors. There is also AF order below T N = 14.3 K with almost atomic size local moments (µ = 0.85 µ B ) in contrast to the small moments in other U-compounds. The AF order coexists with superconductivity below T c = 1.8 K. This suggests that in addition to the heavy itinerant quasiparticles nearly localized 5f-electrons should be present. They result from the dominating 5f 2 configuration of the U 4+ ion . This dual nature of 5f-electrons is even more obvious than in UPt 3 as is seen in various experiments. A direct confirmation of this dual nature of 5f-electrons in UPd 2 Al 3 was obtained from inelastic neutron scattering (INS) which found excitations that originate from local CEF transitions and disperse into bands of ""magnetic excitons"" due to intersite exchange. Complementary tunneling experiments with epitaxial UPd 2 Al 3 -AlO x -Pb heterostructures probed the response of the itinerant quasiparticles and their SC gap. Strong coupling features in the tunneling density of states were reported suggesting that the magnetic excitons identified in INS are the bosonic ""glue"" which binds the electrons to Cooper pairs . This new mechanism for superconductivity is distinctly different from both the electron-phonon and spin fluctuation mechanism known so far. The pairing potential is mediated by a propagating boson (the magnetic exciton) as in the former case but depends on the spin state of conduction electrons as in the latter case.","1"
"1837","hott2013review-CC","80","The possibility of coexisting ferromagnetism and superconductivity was first considered by Ginzburg who noted that this is only possible when the internal ferromagnetic field is smaller than the thermodynamic critical field of the superconductor.

If the temperature drops further below T C the internal ferromagnetism molecular field rapidly becomes larger than H c2 and superconductivity is destroyed. The reentrance of the normal state below T C has indeed been observed in the above compounds. The only compound known so far where local moment ferromagnetism coexists homogeneously with superconductivity for all temperatures below T c is the borocarbide compound ErNi 2 B 2 C (see .

However, unlike in UPt 3 , very large thermodynamic effects, e. g., in specific heat, thermal expansion etc., occur which are hard to reconcile with the small ordered moments. These pronounced anomalies were interpreted as evidence for the presence of a second ""hidden order"" parameter, which cannot be seen in neutron or x-ray diffraction. In the itinerant models the order parameter is due to an unconventional pairing in the particle-hole channel leading to an unconventional SDW which has vanishing moment in the clean limit and also does not break time reversal invariance. The small staggered moments may then be induced in the condensate due to impurity scattering. Finally, in the dual models one assumes a localized singlet-singlet system in interaction with the itinerant electrons to cause induced moment magnetism with small moments but large anomalies.

The total jump of both transitions amounts to ∆ SC C/γT c ~3 which considerably exceeds the BCS value 1.43 for a single transition. It also proves that the SC state is formed from the heavy quasiparticles that cause the enhanced γ-value of the electronic low-temperature specific heat contribution. A T c -splitting of similar size also was clearly seen in thermal expansion measurements . The two SC transitions are reminiscent of the split transition in UPt 3 .

There is evidence that the SC mechanism is primarily of the electron-phonon type although this cannot explain the large anisotropy of the SC gap. At first sight the layered structure is similar to the HTS cuprates. However, unlike the copper oxide planes the NiB 2 planes show buckling. As a consequence, the electronic states at the Fermi level in the borocarbides do not have quasi-2-dimensional d x 2 -y 2 character and, therefore, have much weaker correlations excluding the possibility of AF spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity.","0"

"1857","hott2013review-CC","100","The magnetic RNi 2 B 2 C are an excellent class of materials to study the effects of competition of magnetic order and superconductivity for the following reasons: The T c values are relatively high, and the T c / T N ratio varies systematically across the R-series (see ). Especially interesting are the cases of RNi 2 B 2 C with R = Dy, Ho and Er where T c and T N (or T C ) are not too different, leading to strong competition of the magnetic and superconductivity order parameters. Furthermore, the SC condensate and magnetic moments are carried by different types of electrons, namely itinerant 3d-electrons for the Ni 2 B 2 layers and localized R 3+ 4f-electrons for the R C layers, respectively. Finally, they are well separated and their coupling which is of the local exchange type can be treated in a controlled perturbative way, somewhat akin to the situation in the well known classes of Chevrel phase and ternary compound magnetic superconductors.","0"

This implies that the spatial extent of the Cooper pairs extends over many periods of the alternating molecular field. The latter is therefore effectively averaged to zero and does not suppress superconductivity via an orbital effect. The system is invariant under the combined operation of time inversion followed by a translation with a lattice vector which allows to form Cooper pairs in a spin singlet state with vanishing (crystal) momentum in the AF lattice. This pair-state can be considered as a natural generalization of the pairing in time-reversed states encountered in usual non-magnetic superconductors.","0"

"1860","hott2013review-CC","103","On the other hand, the gap function is strongly anisotropic as can be seen both from temperature and field dependence of thermodynamic and transport quantities indicating the presence of gap nodes . More precisely, within experimental accuracy, there must be at least a gap anisotropy ∆ max /∆ min ≥ 100 . For an electron-phonon superconductor this would be the largest anisotropy ever observed. This conjecture is also supported by the field dependence of the low temperature specific heat and of the thermal conductivity along (001) . Since in the latter case the heat current is perpendicular to the vortices this proves that quasiparticles must be present in the inter-vortex region. This is also required to explain the observation of dHvA oscillations far in the vortex phase. Experimental evidence therefore demands a nodal gap function for borocarbides. A s+g wave model fulfills the requirements. In addition, it explains recent results on ultrasonic attenuation, which also confirmed the existence of gap nodes in the cubic plane .","0"

The boron isotope effect found in YNi 2 B 2 C (α B = 0.2) and LuNi 2 B 2 C (α B = 0.11) is much smaller than the BCS value α X = 0.5. A nonphononic origin stemming from the influence of boron on the charge density in the B 2 Ni 2 layers has therefore been suggested .

"1899","chu2009high-CC","4","Majorities of interactions in solids (and other states of matter) depend critically on the inter- atomic distance. The application of pressure changes the inter-atomic distance and modify the electronic and the phononic energy spectra of a solid without introducing any chemical complexity and keeping the physical complexity to a minimum. This is particularly so when the pressure is hydrostatic and the solid is isotropic. Therefore, high pressure techniques have been extensively used in recent years to explore the physical states of solids, to create new ground states in solids, to test theoretical models and to help develop new theories. For example, there are more naturally nonsuperconducting elements that have been turned into superconductors through the application of pressure in the last half-century than naturally occurring elemental superconductors . It was the high pressure experiments on the A15 compound system to examine the correlation between superconductivity and lattice instabilities in the late 1970's and early 1980's that gave us the confidence that superconductivity could take place at temperatures above 30's K , in contrast to the then theoretical prediction . Again, it was the high pressure experiments on cuprates that demonstrated that indeed a superconducting transition temperature (T c ) could be achieved above 50's K and suggested that the cuprate system warranted further exploration for novel physics and higher T c, besides providing hints for the search for T c > 50's K . In fact, the current record-T c of 164 K was achieved in HgBa 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 9+δ (Hg1223) with an ambient T c of 134 K only under a pressure ~ 30 GPa.","1"
"1900","chu2009high-CC","5","The recent discovery by Hosono et al. of superconductivity in the electron-doped LaOFeAs (La1111) at 26 K has ushered in a new era of high temperature superconductivity. The parent compound of undoped La1111 displays a layered structure of the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs type of space group P4/nmm ). It consists of two layered substructures, namely, the alternating FeAs-layers and the LaO-layers. Each FeAs-layer is composed of a Fe-sheet sandwiched by two As-sheets with the Fe-atoms tetrahedrally coordinated to four As-atoms. Each LaO-layer consists of an O-sheet sandwiched between two La-sheets. FeAs-layers may be expected to form the active block for the charge carriers to flow, and the LaO-layers constitute the charge reservoir blocks that inject charge carriers into the active block to maintain the maximum layer-integrity of the FeAs-layers, as in the cuprate HTSs. It is a semimetal and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at T o ~ 150 K and becomes superconducting when charge carriers are introduced via electron-doping by partial substitution of O by F when T o is suppressed to 0 K. The report of superconductivity in electron-doped LaOFeAs has attracted great attention worldwide for three main reasons among others: 1) it is a new material system with a relatively high T c ; 2) it belongs to a layered transition-element-pnictide material class that is comprised of a large number of compounds and thus gives great possibilities in the search for higher T c ; and 3) it contains a large concentration of the magnetic Fe, which is antithetic to superconductivity, and thus provides an avenue to examine the role of magnetism in high temperature superconductivity (HTS). It is therefore rather natural to hope that what high pressure has done to cuprate HTS can be repeated in Fe-pnictide superconductors in raising the T c . In the ensuing months, many other superconducting Fe-pnictides have been discovered. They are grouped into four homologous series, 1111 (ROFeAs with R = rare-earth; AeFFeAs with Ae = alkaline earth), 122 (AeFe 2 As 2 ; AFe 2 As 2 with A = alkaline), 111 (AFeAs) and 011 (FeSe). When properly doped, the maximum T c 's are ~ 55 K for 1111 , ~ 38 K for 122 , and 12-25 K for 111 , and ~ 9-14 K for 011 , respectively. Many high pressure experiments have been conducted and theoretical models proposed on these compounds. We shall first briefly review the results and discuss their implications here before presenting the details and discussions according to the different homologous series in later sections.","1"
"1901","chu2009high-CC","6","Immediately after the report of 26 K superconductivity, high pressure experiments on the electron-doped LaOFeAs were carried out . The reasonably high rate of T c -enhancement by pressure of +1.2 K/GPa coupled with the rapid T c -rise to 55 K by replacement of La observed in electron-doped La1111 by rare-earth elements of smaller ionic radii gave scientists the optimism that a miracle similar to that for cuprate HTS was in the offing and the significant role of magnetism in HTS was about to unravel. Given the similarities between the Fe-pnictide and cuprate superconductors, the doping (x) dependence of the pressure effect on the T c of electron- doped Sm1111 (SmOFeAs) was soon investigated after the discovery . Pressure was found to enhance T c for samples in the underdoped region, i.e. dT c /dx > 0; to suppress T c for samples in the overdoped region where dT c /dx < x; and to affect T c only slightly for the optimally doped sample, very different from the case of Hg1223 . The observations suggest that the maximum T c of the R1111 may not exceed 50's K and that the lower-than-50's K observed then in R1111 may rise to the 50's K should the sample conditions be optimized. Unfortunately, the highest T c observed in superconducting Fe-pnictides to date has not exceeded 55 K, although the then lower-than-50 K-T c was raised to above 50 K. Pressure was also found to suppress the magnetic transition temperature T o , consistent with the positive pressure effect on T c of the underdoped samples and with the doping effect on T o . Later, more high pressure experiments were made on the R1111 phase compounds . They demonstrated the close relationship between magnetism and superconductivity, the ability to raise the T c of close to optimally doped R1111 up to 45 K rapidly below ~ 5 GPa followed by a slow T c -drop at higher pressures and the possibility to induce superconductivity in the undoped parent R1111 with a rapid T c up to ~ 25 K.","1"
"1902","chu2009high-CC","7","Systematic high-pressure studies have also been carried out on the electron-doped R1111 obtained via O-deficiency through high pressure synthesis . The T c of these O- deficient samples were observed to reach its maximum at ~ 50 K rapidly although at a slightly lower pressure of ~ 2 GPa similar to that observed in the F-doped R1111, re-enforcing the significant role of effective valence count of the anions or the carrier concentration independent of the details of doping.","1"
"1903","chu2009high-CC","8","In the process of searching for novel compounds that may have a higher T c than the doped R1111, SrFe 2 As 2 and BaFe 2 As 2 which were known to crystallize in a layered structure of the ThCr 2 Si 2 with the I4/mmm space group were revisited. Sr122 and Ba122 are semi- metals, and possess alternating FeAs-layers and antiferromagnetic transitions at ~ 200 K and 140 K , respectively, coinciding with a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition, similar to R1111. They become superconducting and form a new homologous series of AeFe 2 As 2 (Ae122 with Ae = alkaline-earth elements) when hole-doped by partial replacement of Ae with alkaline elements = A . The large solubility range of (Sr 1-x K x )122 make easy the formation of the full T c -x phase diagram and thus enables the systematic study of the x- dependence of the pressure dependence on T c . Indeed, it was found that dT c /dP > 0 for the hole-doped Sr122 samples in the region where dT c /dx > 0; whereas dT c /dP <0 for samples in the region where dT c /dx < 0, similar to the observation on the electron-doped Sm1111 . Aside from what was concluded early, the observation shows a symmetry between electron-and hole- dopings consistent with previous doping results at ambient pressure . Single crystals of members of the doped and undoped 122 have been successfully grown. They provide the unique opportunities to explore their physical properties in a more defined manner and make easier comparisons with theories. Among the interesting findings are: 1) the sensitivity of physical properties (especially the pressure induced superconductivity) of 122 single crystals to pressure hydrostaticity ; 2) pressure suppresses the magnetic transition temperature T o in all 122 compounds ; 3) pressure induces superconductivity in undoped Sr122 and Ba122 up to ~ 38 K as by doping but only over a limited pressure range ; 4) conflicting reports exist concerning the pressure-induced superconductivity in Ca122 over a narrow pressure range around ~ 0.2-0.5 GPa , leaving this case uncertain and hence raising similar questions about the nature of the pressure-induced superconductivity in Sr122 and Ba122; and 5) pressure generates a new phase designated as the ""collapsed"" tetragonal phase in Ca111 at low temperature at < 0.3 GPa, which is stable to higher temperature at high pressures .","0"
"1904","chu2009high-CC","9","The observations show that: 1) magnetism and superconductivity are closely entangled similar to 1111; 2) special attention should be paid to the pressure conditions to extract meaningful data; and 3) the intriguing T-P phase diagram needs further study to extract possible important information concerning not just superconductivity but also the physico-chemical formation of the Fe-pnictides that may lead to higher T c.","0"

This tendency of T c , passing through a maximum with increasing pressure, has been confirmed for other underdoped R(O 1-x F x )FeAs compounds [16]. The observations can be summarized as: for electron doped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs, dT c /dP > 0 when dT c /dx > 0 in the underdoped region and dT c /dP < 0 when dT c /dx < 0 in the overdoped region, similar to the HTS cuprates as far as the signs are concerned [47]. This implies that the main effect of pressure is to promote electron-doping in Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs, while it generates holes for the HTS cuprates. It should be noted that the suppression of the SDW transition observed should also contribute to the positive dT c /dP of the underdoped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs. By referring back to the quadratic universal T c (x) relation for the hole-doped cuprates by Presland et al. , we have proposed a possible upper T c -limit < 50's K for the R1111 FeAs-superconductors, independent of the R in R1111 and suggested to look for higher T c in the FeAs-layered compounds with more complex structures than that of the R1111 series . It was later shown theoretically by Nekrasov et al. that R is indeed electronically isolated from the conducting electrons and plays no role in the superconductivity of Fe-pnictides. Unfortunately, our predicted upper T c-limit remains valid to date; however, we hope the latter prediction will bear fruit soon.","0"
"1913","chu2009high-CC","18","At about the same time, Takahashi et al. decided to raise the T c of La(O 1-x F x )FeAs by pressure. They investigated the pressure effects on the resistivity ρ of the optimally electron- doped (with an x where dT c /dx ~ 0) and the electron-underdoped (in a region where dT c /dx < 0) La(O 1-x F x )FeAs with x = 0.11 and 0.05. Their ambient onset T c 's are 28 K and 9 K for the x = 0.11 and 0.05 samples, respectively. The pressure was generated in a BeCu piston-cylinder cell up to 3 GPa hydrostatically and up to 30 GPa in a diamond anvil cell quasi-hydrostatically. The ρ(T)'s of the x = 0.11 and 0.05 samples are shown in Figs. 5a and b at different pressures. The onset-T c of the x = 0.11 sample, as defined in Fig. 5a, increases steeply from 28 K to 43 K with pressure up to 3 GPa at a large initial rate dT c /dP ~ + 8 K/GPa and then drops off slowly to 9 K at 30 GPa at a rate dT c /dP ~ -1.4 K/GPa as shown in Fig. 6. The onset-T c of the sample of x = 0.05 was also found to increase with pressure but at a slower rate of + 2.0 K/GPa below 3 GPa where the experiment stops (Fig. 7 and inset). The experiment did show that the T c of La(O 1- x F x )FeAs with F-doping can be raised to a maximum of 43 K by the joint effects of chemical (F- doping) and pressure doping. The authors further pointed out that a large number of existing transition-metal-oxypnictes with a structure similar to LaOFeAs [7] may offer great opportunities for seeking superconductors of higher T c by proper doping. The experiment also shows the sensitivity of ρ and the superconducting transition of La(O 1-x F x )FeAs to non- hydrostatic pressure effects as evident in Figs. 5a and b where ρ(T)'s at different pressures are displayed. Pressure inhomogeneity tends to broaden the superconducting transition and remove the zero-ρ state, making it difficult to define the onset T c at high pressure. This was further demonstrated later in the study of 122 Fe-pnictides where hydrostaticity may have a bearing on the nature of superconductivity induced by pressure as was observed decades ago in α-uranium. It should be noted that Fratini et al. suggested that internal chemical pressure may simulate the externally applied pressure effect on T c by analyzing and comparing the structural transitions of the undoped LaOFeAs and NdOFeAs. Later Wang et al. carried out an iso-valent-doping experiment on LaOFe(As 1-x P x ) by partial replacement of As by P. Their XRD results show a reduction in volume as x increases. They found that LaOFe(As 1-x P x ) become superconducting with T c reaching 10.5 K at x = 0.4. Unfortunately, a higher T c was not realized.","1"
"1914","chu2009high-CC","19","The large pressure effect on the T c of the optimally doped La(O 1-x F x )FeAs sample observed at low pressure appears to be in direct conflict with the universal T c (x)-relation based on which our conjecture of an ultimate T c < 50's K was made. A zero dT c /dP is expected from the standard universal T c (x)-relation. Such a prediction is true only when the rigid band model is true, i.e. the T c (x)-relation is not altered by pressure in terms of the maximum T c and the optimal x where T c reaches its maximum. However, the T c (x)-relation has been shown to undergo a general shift without changing the general features of the relation in the case of HgBa 2 Ca n-1 Cu n O m+2n+2+δ , whose maximum T c 's and optimal x's are known to be shifted upward by pressure . In other words, pressure changes the carrier concentration and the band simultaneously. Therefore, the positive dT c /dP for an optimally-doped La(O 1-x F x )FeAs is understood in terms of this modified T c (x)-model. However, the asymmetrical T c -peak with respect to pressure is less obvious and whether it is a characteristic of the Fe-pnicitides is unclear.","0"

Similar to their previous work on the x = 0.11 sample, all display rapid T c -increase followed by a slower T c -drop above ~ 5 GPa to 30 GPa and the rate is the highest of 8 K/GPa for the optimally doped sample. They also witnessed the undoped LaOFeAs to become superconducting at pressures above ~ 2 GPa. While the maximum T c 's for the x = 0.11 and 0.14 samples are about the same at ~ 43 K, they are lower at ~ 29 K and 20 K for samples with x = 0.05 and 0. The data indicate that the nearly constant maximum T c close to the optimal doping at ambient pressure and the general nonlinear overall T c -P behavior are consistent with the modified T c (x)-model discussed above. In the same study, Takahashi et al. found that the T c of LaOFeP with an ambient pressure value of T c = 5.8 K rises steeply to 8.8 K at 1 GPa and then drops rapidly to ~ 7 K with further increasing pressure, similar to the LaOFeAs. The crystal structure of these samples was also studied by XRD at room temperature under pressures up to 10 GPa. They found a bulk modulus of ~ 70 GPa, similar to the cuprates, and a reduction in anisotropy by pressure but no pressure-induced structural change. Zocco et al. [19] found a qualitatively similar T c (P)-behavior of La(O 1-x F x )FeAs with a more rapid drop of T c at high pressure. However, they found an exception of a continuous decrease of T c with pressure for the optimally doped Ce(O 1-x F x )FeAs (Fig. 9), showing that R in R1111 may play a role in their T c - response to pressure, although there may still be uncertainty in the exact doping level. More examples with such behavior of negative effect on T c from low to high pressure were found, for instance, by Takeshita et al. [23] in another study on oxygen-deficient NdO 1-y FeAs. Garbarino et al. [18] measured the pressure effects on the T c and the lattice parameters of the optimally doped La(O 1-x F x )FeAs. They found that T c decreases linearly with pressure up to ~ 20 GPa. Yi et al. [20] reported the similar dependence of T c on pressure for the nominally optimal-doped and overdoped La(O 1-x F x )FeAs. However, the exact values of x cited may be questionable in view of their relative T c 's. Okada et al. [22] measured the T o and T c of undoped LOFeAs and found that both coexist in a wide range of pressures of ~ 1 -13 GPa. From the above reports, it is clear that the pressure effect on the T c of R1111 depends on R, the pressure hydrostaticity, and the doping level. The effect of pressure hydrostaticity above 2-3 GPa cannot be neglected and the uncertainty associated with the latter is large due to the complexity in sample preparation and characterization.","1"

They become superconducting and form a new homologous series of 122 when hole doped, i.e. by partial replacement of Ae with alkaline elements = A, (Ae 1-x A x )Fe 2 As 2 [9, 10, 25, 28]. The large solubility range of (Sr 1-x K x )Fe 2 As 2 makes it possible to form a complete T c -x phase diagram at ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12 where T o represents the SDW transition temperature. The maximum T c = 38 K takes place at x ~ 0.4 -0.5. Possible coexistence of SDW and the superconducting states is apparent between x ~ 0.2 and 0.3. The phase diagram makes possible the systematic study of the x-dependence of the pressure coefficient of T c of the 122 series. It should be noted that this was the first complete T c (x)-phase diagram of Fe-pnictides available at the time. We have, therefore, measured ρ(T) and χ ac (T) under hydrostatic pressures up to 1.7 GPa, for different x's to cover the three major regions of hole-doping [10, 15, 29]. The T c (P) for samples with x = 0.2 (underdoped), 0.4 (~ optimally-doped) and 0.7 (overdoped) are given in Fig. 13. It is unambiguously shown that dT c /dP is positive for the underdoped sample, close to zero for the optimally doped sample and negative for the overdoped sample, in agreement with the prediction of the universal T c (x)- relation proposed for the hole-doped cuprate HTSs as discussed in section 2.1. The observation can be summarized as: dT c /dP > 0 in the region where dT c /dx > 0; dT c /dP ~ 0 where dT c /dx ~ 0; and dT c /dP < 0 where dT c /dx < 0, suggesting that pressure promotes holes. The pressure study on electron-doped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs suggests that pressure generates electrons. Based on these two studies, one may conclude that symmetry between the electron-and hole-dopings exists in Fe- pnictide superconductors, in agreement with the earlier observation by Wen et al. .

Similar to the R1111 homologous series, pressure is found to suppress the magnetic order . However, the occurrence of superconductivity in Ae122 under pressure appears to be more complicated than in R1111. For instance, some reported the observation of pressure- induced superconductivity in all three Ae122 members in different narrow pressure-ranges, while others raised serious doubt of its existence in Ca122 and yet others questioned about the nature of the pressure-induced superconductivity in all three Ae122 compounds. These divergent views indeed are extremely puzzling, given the fact that bulk superconductivity has been reported in the chemically doped samples of all members of the Ae122 series and the great similarities among the Ae122 members.

Pressure does enhance T c in the underdoped state, dT c /dp > 0, T c is nearly independent of pressure for optimally doped compounds, dT c /dp ~ 0, and pressure suppresses T c in the overdoped state, dT c /dp < 0, revealing an interesting analogy to the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors.","0"

In comparison with LiFeAs, LiFeP can be viewed as compressed LiFeAs. At 5.5 − 6.5 GPa T c of LiFeAs matches T c of LiFeP at atmospheric pressure: LiFeAs ""becomes"" LiFeP. The lattice parameters obtained for LiFeP are a = 3.692Å, c = 6.031Å 22 compared to a = 3.670Å, c = 6.108Å for LiFeAs at 6.54 GPa.

This leads to a smaller structural anisotropy in LiFeP compared to LiFeAs at 6.54 GPa.

In LiFeAs T c (p) decreases linearly on increasing pressure in the whole pressure range up to ∼ 10 GPa. The initial slope of T c (p) |dT c (p)/dp | p=0 | = 1.23 K/GPa for LiFeP is significantly smaller compared to the value in LiFeAs, |dT c (p)/dp | p=0 | = (1.56 ∼ 2) K/GPa. Since T c (p) decreases linearly in LiFeAs, the same significant differ- ence in the slopes of T c (p) is present when we compare them where the T c 's of LiFeP at p = 0 and LiFeAs un- der pressure (5.5 − 6.5 GPa) are matching. This clearly indicates that the superconductivity in LiFeP is more ro- bust than in LiFeAs. This is furthermore supported by a decreasing slope of T c (p) upon increasing pressure in LiFeP (see ). Therefore, our study suggests that a more regular [FePn 4 ] tetrahedron ""strengthens"" the su- perconducting state, but is not determining the size of T c . We will now turn to the unusual increase of the low- temperature normal-state resistivity above p ≈ 2 GPa. While the residual resistivity, ρ 0 (p), increases by about 1/3 from 1.68 GPa to 2.75 GPa, the A coefficient stays nearly pressure independent in this pressure range. This indicates that the QP-QP scattering rate does not change, but additional contributions to the residual scat- tering appear and become stronger upon increasing pres- sure. Since, as we discussed before, ρ 300K (p) decreases in the mentioned pressure range and, thus, we can exclude an extrinsic reason and, clearly, pressure does not add im- purities, a different scattering mechanism has to be con- sidered. An increase of ρ 0 (p) is generally caused by addi- tional disordered scattering centers. A similar increase of the resistivity at low temperatures is observed in LiFeAs, but at much higher pressures p 11 GPa. There, it has been proposed that additional disordered scatter- ing centers created by local magnetic ordering cause the enhanced ρ 0 . Increasing pressure reduces the in-plane Fe-Fe distance and concomitantly enhances local mag- netic correlations leading to additional magnetic scatter- ing centers.","0"

Magnesium diboride with TC = 39 K has been discovered using this strategy 5 . A further increase in lep is ineffective in enhancing TC because the localization of electron pairs in real space results in the formation of a charge density wave, and the highest TC considered within the BCS theory is approximately 40 K. This BCS wall has been easily overcome with the demonstration of perovskite-type copper oxides 6 . Unconventional materials, including fullerenes 7 and iron pnictides 8 , have reigned over the class of high-TC superconductors. However, a conventional superconductor (sulphur hydride) recently created a new record of TC = 203 K under an ultra-high pressure 9 .

Here, we report new superconductors produced from higher titanium oxides, which are Ti4O7 and g-Ti3O5 films synthesized using advanced epitaxial growth on specific oxide substrates. Their TC are 3.0 and 7.1 K, respectively. The latter is the highest known value among simple oxides. The temperature dependence of resistivity strongly depended on the growth 3 atmosphere. Higher titanium-oxide films grown under a more oxidative condition exhibited metal-insulator transition accompanied by clear hysteresis at ~150 K. The insulating phase was suppressed in the films grown under a less oxidative condition, and the superconducting phase appeared at low temperatures.

These substrates are insulating, non-magnetic, and exhibit high reduction resistance, providing advantages in the growth and search of a superconducting sample. However, because titanium oxides form various polymorphisms with different ratios of oxygen to titanium, their crystal structures must be carefully controlled and distinguished. Pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) with a TiOx target (x ~ 1.5) was conducted at a high temperature to tune the degree of subtle oxidation by feeding a small amount of oxygen gas or even flowing inert Ar gas. Then, we used the tilt angle c-dependence of 2q-q XRD profiles to survey the asymmetric film reflections (see Figs. S1 and S5 in Supplemental Materials). Reflections coming from the substrate and film were found at characteristic c angles. Since the intensities of the film reflections were too weak to determine the d values of interplanar spacing distances precisely, synchrotron radiation XRD measurements were also performed (see Figs.

In contrast, the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting transitions exhibited a difference. The superconductivity in the Ti4O7 film disappeared above 2 K under a magnetic field of 7 T. As for the g-Ti3O5 films, superconductivity remained robust even under 9 T. In addition, a clear Meissner effect was observed for the g-Ti3O5 film (inset of Fig. ).

The insulating Ti4O7 film exhibiting such characteristics can be regarded as a bipolaronic insulator at low temperatures.

Our growth of Ti4O7 films under Ar gas atmosphere aims at inducing extra Ti 3d electrons by oxygen vacancies which dilute the bipolaron density. In fact, the inverse RH of the superconducting film suggests the suppression of the bipolaron formation (Fig. ). In the bipolaronic phase diagram shown in Fig. of Ref. , the bipolaronic insulator and superconductivity co-exist at a specific bipolaron density. Our Ti4O7 film grown under a moderate growth atmosphere (PAr = 1 × 10 -6 Torr) exhibited hysteresis at ~150 K and superconductivity at 2.9 K (see Fig. and Fig. ).

The first-principle calculations revealed a one-dimensional conducting pathway along the c-axis arising from the density of states at the Fermi level . The low-dimensional electronic structure may lead to the pairing of electrons (bipolaron) in g-Ti3O5 at a low temperature. On the other hand, the small number of studies on g-Ti3O5 makes it difficult to discuss the strength of the electron-phonon interaction, the formation of bipolarons, and the density of states at the Fermi level.

We calculate the magnetic ground states of different transition metal compounds with this structure. It is found that (Mn,Fe,Co)-based compounds all have a G-type antiferromagnetic(AFM) insulating ground state while Ni-based compounds are paramagnetic metal. The AFM interaction is the largest in the Co-based compounds as the three t2g orbitals all strongly participate in AFM superexchange interactions. The abrupt quenching of the magnetism from the Co to Ni-based compounds is very similar to those from Fe to Co-based pnictides in which a C-type AFM state appears in the Fe-based ones but vanishes in the Co-based ones. This behavior can be considered as an electronic signature of the high-Tc gene.

"2035","CoA4_HTSC_theory1807.00934-CC","3","Recently, based on the mechanism that superconductivity is induced by the AFM superexchange interaction, we have suggested that there is an electronic gene that separates the two high-T c families from other correlated electronic mate- rials. Those d-orbitals that make the strongest in-plane d-p couplings in the cation-anion complexes in both high-T c fam- ilies are isolated near Fermi surface energy. This prop- erty makes the effective AFM superexchange interactions to maximize their contribution to superconducting pairing. The electronic gene can only be realized in very limited special cases. It requires a perfect collaboration between local building blocks, global lattice structures, as well as specific electron filling configurations in the d-shell of transition metal atoms. In the cuprates, the gene is realized because the d x 2 −y 2 e g orbital can be isolated near Fermi energy in a two dimen- sional Cu-O square lattice formed by corner-shared CuO 6 oc- tahedra( or CuO 4 square planar) with a d filling configuration of Cu 2+ . In iron-based superconductors, we have shown that the gene condition is satisfied because two t 2g d xy -type or- bitals are isolated near a d filling configuration of Fe 2+ in a Fe(Se/As) two dimensional square lattice formed by edge- shared Fe(Se/As) 4 tetrahedra.","0"

Up to now, we have predicted that the d 7 gene condition can be realized in a two dimensional hexagonal layer formed by edge-shared trig- onal biprymidal complexes or in a two dimensional square lattice formed by the conner-shared tetrahedra, and the d 8 gene condition exists in a two dimensional square lattice formed by Ni-based mix-anion octahedra.

The electronic gene is realized in the d 7 filling configuration of Co 2+ as we have proposed in ref. The successful syn- thesizations of the type of transition metal compounds were reported in the past. However, very few measurements have been made to study their electronic properties. Here we calculate their electronic and magnetic properties under the formula CuInM 2 (S, Se, Te) 4 with M = Mn, Fe, Co and Ni. In all these materials, the electronic physics near Fermi en- ergy stems from the M(S,Se,Te) 2 layer and is attributed to the d-orbitals of the transition metal elements. In the Co case, the three t 2g orbitals are near degenerate and close to half- filling, and make the dominating contribution near Fermi en- ergy. The (Mn,Fe,Co)-based compounds all have a checker- board (G-type) AFM insulating ground state while Ni-based compounds are paramagnetic metal. The AFM exchange in- teraction is the largest in the Co-based compounds. This mag- netic trend from the Co to Ni based compounds is very simi- lar to those from Fe to Co-based pnictides in which a C-type AFM state appears in the Fe-based ones but vanishes in the Co-based ones. This result indicates that the Co-based parental compounds are multi-orbital Mott insulators. How- ever, upon electron doping, the magnetic long-range order can quickly be diminished and possible d-wave superconductivity can arise as we predicted in ref. Experimental results appear to be consistent with our calculation results. The new materials closely resemble both cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and can bridge the gap between their elec- tronic properties.

"2070","Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC","1","Superconductivity (SC) is one of the most intriguing physical phenomena in nature. Nucleation of SC has long been considered highly unfavorable if not impossible near ferromagnetism (FM) 1-5 , in low dimensionality 6,7 and, above all, out of non-superconductor. Here we report observation of SC with TC near 4 K in Ni/Bi bilayers that defies all known paradigms of superconductivity, where neither ferromagnetic Ni film nor rhombohedra Bi film is superconducting in isolation 8 . This highly unusual SC is independent of the growth order (Ni/Bi or Bi/Ni), but highly sensitive to the constituent layer thicknesses. Most importantly, the SC, distinctively non-s pairing, is triggered from, but does not occur at, the Bi/Ni interface. Using point contact Andreev reflection (AR) 9 , we show evidences that the unique SC, naturally compatible with magnetism, is triplet p-wave pairing. This work might open a new door to explore novel SC which could lead to potential applications in superconducting spintronics 10,11.","1"
"2071","Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC","2","Understanding how and why SC occurs in a given material has been very challenging for physicists for more than a hundred years, notwithstanding the major milestones, such as the London theory, the Landau-Ginzburg theory, and the BCS theory . The extreme challenge to predict the occurrence of SC is symbolized by the long string of unanticipated but breathtaking advances -with the unexpected discoveries of cuprates and Fe-pnictides being the dramatic modern examples . Because of their incompatibility, the nucleation of SC near a ferromagnet is difficult and has never been realized except cases where another superconductor provides proximity boosted cooper pairs . This perceived necessity to start with another superconductor is engrained by the extensive study of the proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructures, where all the structures involve a superconductor with either stable or metastable structure . Compounding the difficulty, it is also generally recognized that SC with substantial TC is unfavorable in low dimensionality because of strong quantum fluctuation . This paper reports a serendipitous finding of SC that emerges under the most implausible circumstances -near a ferromagnet, in low dimension, and in an otherwise non-superconducting material.","0"

It should be noted that with the appearance of superconductor in Ni(3 nm)/Bi(20 nm), the Ni layer still remains ferromagnetic even above 300 K as shown by the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) result in Fig. . The incompatibility of FM and SC notwithstanding, this is the most dramatic nucleation of SC, in which a non-superconducting material becomes superconductor when it is covered by a strong ferromagnet.","1"
"2074","Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC","5","It is also well established that Ni in its thermodynamically stable face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure is ferromagnetic yet non-superconducting. Now starting from MgO(001) substrate, we epitaxially grow 3 nm Ni(001) film at 300 K then cool down to 110 K and epitaxially grow 20 nm rhombohedra Bi(110) film on the top, and the good quality of the heterostructure with sharp interfaces is revealed by the reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) patterns and the cross section scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in Fig. . Strikingly, this Bi(20 nm)/Ni(3 nm) also becomes superconducting as shown by Fig. ; meanwhile the Ni layer underneath is clearly ferromagnetic as shown by Fig. . It should be noted that our results are distinctively different from the previous report of S/F proximity effect in Bi/Ni bilayer where SC is originated from the novel fcc structure of Bi . Since neither ferromagnetic Ni nor rhombohedra Bi is superconducting in isolation, and furthermore the SC is found to be independent of the deposition order of Ni and Bi, it is natural to conceive that the SC is induced at the interface. Indeed, the direct experimental evidence comes from the RT curve of Bi(6 nm)/Ni(0.18 nm)/Cu(2 nm) as shown in Fig. , where 0.18 nm corresponds to one monolayer of Ni. While SC has not fully developed, the onset of SC (blue dots) is unmistaken. In contrast, Bi(20 nm)/Cu(2 nm) is non-superconducting (yellow dots).","0"
"2075","Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC","6","Even more striking is the thickness dependence of the SC in the Bi/Ni bilayers. We first fix the Bi film thickness at 15 nm and vary the Ni layer thickness to explore the influence of FM on the SC. For a small increasing thickness of Ni, the SC is substantially suppressed. As shown in Fig. , for Ni layers between 2 -4 nm thick, the SC is systematically suppressed and completely destroyed with 4 nm Ni. This result can be understood as a consequence of gradual penetration of the exchange interaction (effectively a strong magnetic field) from ferromagnetic Ni into the Bi film . Because of the finite size effect on the Curie temperature (equivalently the exchange field) of an ultrathin ferromagnetic film, the exchange field at the interface of Bi/Ni should be significantly stronger when a Ni film changes from 2 nm to 4 nm thick .","0"
"2076","Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC","7","Therefore when Ni films are very thin with sufficiently weak exchange interaction penetration, the Cooper pairs might survive near the Bi/Ni interface. Whereas, for thick Ni films, corresponding to strong exchange interaction penetration, the Cooper pairs are completely suppressed by the exchange field from the Ni layer, as shown schematically in Fig. . These results clearly suggest the delicate dual role of the Ni layer; it creates the interface which may trigger SC via yet to be identified microscopic mechanism (e.g., electron-phonon or ferromagnetic fluctuation, etc), but it is also the detriment to eventually destroy the Cooper pairs.","0"
"2077","Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC","8","Since the Bi layer is nonmagnetic and non-superconducting, there should be no effect on the SC from the Bi thickness. However, as shown next, the thickness of the Bi layer plays a crucial role for the nucleation of the SC. In Fig. , we measured a series of Bi/Ni(4 nm) samples with a fixed Ni(4 nm) layer for which the SC has already been completely suppressed as shown in Fig. . As we increase the Bi layer from 15 nm, remarkably the SC reappears again with the same TC of 4 K. Since the SC in the Bi(15 nm)/Ni(4 nm) is completely suppressed by the exchange field from the Ni layer, further increasing the Bi layer thickness cannot modify the interface or affect the Ni layer, the recurrence of the SC implies that the SC does not occur at the interface even though it may be triggered by the interface, which is again diametrically different from the S/F proximity effects. In fact the reappearance of the SC is a salient feature for the Ni/Bi superconducting systems. As seen in Fig. , when TC is plotted as a function of the Bi film thickness for several Ni film thicknesses, in each case there is always a similar sharp increase (within 5 nm) to saturation. For example, the SC for Ni(6 nm) reappears at about 30 nm of Bi, very far from the interface, and its TC reaches about 4 K at 35 nm of Bi. This result also excludes unambiguously the possibility that the SC in Bi/Ni comes from Bi-Ni alloy if any at the interface.","1"
"2078","Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC","9","Based on the foregoing results, we construct a series of schematics in Fig. , e and f, to illustrate the occurrence and evolution of SC in the Bi/Ni system. We believe that this unusual SC behavior in Bi/Ni must be related to the unique electronic property of Bi thin film. It has been realized that the interior of Bi thin films up to 90 nm is semiconducting (also confirmed here in this work by the yellow curve in Fig. ) then becomes semimetal for thicker films; meanwhile all the surfaces of Bi films including the top, bottom and side surfaces are always metallic , irrelevant to the orientations of the exposed surfaces . It has also been known that, at 4 K, the thermal electronic excitation in the film interior appears already as the Bi film is thicker than 20 nm. Because of the well-known unusually long Fermi wavelength (~ 30 nm) and extremely long mean free path of electrons (up to mm) in Bi, as well as the extremely long decay of the inter- surface interaction in Bi films , the Cooper pairs could in principle be triggered via the interface in various channels but away from the interface, e.g., two electrons paired in the film interior or on the opposite surface to the interface, as shown schematically in Fig. . In fact, this is distinctively different from any other superconducting systems where Cooper pairs always live at the place of the cause of interaction. These aspects suggest that the highly unusual SC in epitaxial Bi/Ni, differing from those of all known superconductors, may be topological in nature.","0"
"2079","Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC","10","Since a point contact only measures the resistance at the vicinity of the contact, the contact resistance between a superconductor and a normal metal depends strongly on the contact size and can vary from a few  to over 1000 . However, the contact resistance between two superconductors does not depend strongly on the contact size and this can be used to verify the SC at the surface of the Bi/Ni bilayers. We choose Indium, which is a conventional superconductor with TC = 3.41 K, as a soft tip to contact on the bare sample Bi (20 nm)/Ni (2 nm). A schematic setup of the point contact is illustrated in the inset of Fig. . We have made over 10 contacts, all the contacts shows a similar resistance very close to zero, showing that the surface of Bi/Ni bilayer is indeed superconducting. The temperature dependence of a representative contact resistance is shown in Fig. . The TC of both superconductors are obvious and consistent with Fig. . This result shows that the Bi surface is indeed superconducting.","1"

For a conventional superconductor such as Nb, the Andreev spectrum shows the well-known double-peak structure in the differential conductance (dI/dV), as shown by the inset of Fig. for a 100 nm Nb film measured with a gold tip at 4.2 K. The peak position indicates the gap value of Nb and the change of dI/dV (the ratio of dI/dV at zero bias to that at large bias) must be less than 2, the Andreev limit . We have measured the Bi/Ni bilayer samples with and without a 2 nm gold protection layer using materials of zero spin polarization such as gold and highly spin-polarized materials such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO). We have measured over 100 contacts on these samples with contact resistance from a few  to over 1000  for both LSMO and gold tips. Surprisingly, there is only a single peak at zero bias. None of the Andreev spectra exhibit the double-peak feature as that of all conventional superconductors (e.g., Nb) and Fe pnictides. One representative Andreev spectra is shown in Fig. for a gold tip in contact on the sample Bi(20 nm)/Ni(2 nm)/MgO(100). The change of the dI/dV peak can be much larger than the Andreev limit 2 and a highly spin-polarized current from the LSMO tip cannot suppress the peak, as shown in Fig. . These results rule out conventional s-wave pairing. A possibility could be SC naturally compatible with magnetism, such as triplet p-wave pairing. Finally, it should be mentioned that the in-plane upper critical field Hc2 is beyond the Pauli limit (see Extended Data and Supplementary Information), which is consistent with foregoing AR results.","0"

The onset temperatures of the superconducting transition (T c onset ) of the nominally synthesized Sr 2 ScFePO 3 and Sr 2 VFeAsO 3 are 17 K (6) and 37.2 K , respectively. On the other hand, Sr 2 ScFeAsO 3 , Sr 2 CrFeAsO 3 , Ba 2 ScFeAsO 3 , and the Ca-Sc-Fe-As-O system have been reported to not exhibit a superconducting phase; however, when Sc 3+ or Cr was substituted with Ti 4+ , these compounds exhibit superconductivity with T c onset = 45 K, 29.2 K, and 37 K . Other superconducting materials have been reported for the 21113 systems; i.e. Sr 2 (Mg, Ti)FeAsO 3 with T c onset = 33-39 K (14), Ca 2 AlFePO 3-y with T c onset = 17.1 K, and Ca 2 AlFeAsO 3-y with T c onset = 28.3 K.

"2091","1802.03907-CC","4","Among these compounds, Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ has attracted attention as a practical superconducting material because of its large upper critical magnetic field ( 0 H c2 ) . The large  0 H c2 is suitable for applications involving high magnetic fields. As shown in Fig. , the crystal structure of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ is described as a tetragonal lattice with FeAs carrier conducting layers sandwiched by Sr 2 VO 3−δ perovskite-related carrier-blocking layers. Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ , which has been reported with nominal chemical compositions, shows superconducting transitons at T c onset ≤ 37.2 K under ambient pressure and at T c onset = 46.0 K (21) under high pressure. Munevar et al. and Hummel et al. reported that the superconducting Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ shows a quadrupole doublet for the 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra at 1.5-300 K , indicating no spontaneous magnetic moment at the Fe sublattice. These reports are in contrast with normal conducting Sr 2 ScFeAsO 3 and Sr 2 CrFeAsO 3 . The 57 Fe Mössbauer spectrum of Sr 2 ScFeAsO 3 exhibits sextet lines, indicating an existence of a finite internal magnetic field due to magnetic moments of the Fe sublattice. Furthermore, Tegel et al. reported that 57 Fe Mössbauer spectrum of Sr 2 CrFeAsO 3 shows substantial broadening at 4.2 K, which could be fitted to various internal magnetic fields. The 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra of Sr 2 MFeAsO 3 (M = Sc, Cr) suggest that a magnetic phase of the Fe sublattice in Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ are still controversial . Therefore, constructing magnetic and electronic phase diagrams of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ requires systematic study of its chemical compositions and element-specific magnetic measurements.","1"

The 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra are composed of quadrupole doublet absorption lines at 300 K for each sample, indicating the paramagnetic (PM) phase of the Fe sublattice. Asymmetry doublet absorption lines of the samples are derived from the anisotropy of crystal orientation (44) for Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ . 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra of the δ = 0.232 sample were fitted to a doublet pattern at 2.5 ≤ T ≤ 300 K without an internal magnetic field (B int ), indicating the PM Fe in the δ = 0.232 sample. The δ = 0.124, 0.232, and 0.237 samples also exhibit the PM Fe at T  4.2 K.

The absorption lines became broader at T~10 K, indicating that spontaneous magnetic moments appear in the Fe-sublattice. The broad absorption lines are clearly different from a sextet split spectrum showing the antiferromagnetically ordered Fe sublattice which is typically observed for mother compounds of iron-based superconductors; LaFeAsO and BaFe 2 As 2 . As shown in Fig. , the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the δ = 0.267, 0.509, 0.631 samples substantially increase at T < 20 K. The increasing FWHM indicates finite distribution of B int in these samples. The broad absorption lines also indicate that both of magnetic Fe and nonmagnetic Fe appear in a same chemical composition. Given the wide distribution of B int , the broad absorption lines can be fitted sufficiently well enough to quantify mean values of the B int . In the present study, Hesse and Rübertsch's method was applied to obtain the distribution of B int . Figure shows temperature dependence of the isomer shift (IS), quadrupole splitting (QS), and FWHM for the δ = 0.124, 0.232, 0.237, 0.267, 0.509, and 0.631 samples.

The smaller IS value of the δ = 0.124 sample indicates higher s-electron densities around the nucleus compared to the other samples. In terms of the Debye approximation of the lattice vibrations, Debye temperatures were obtained at 454(29) K for the δ = 0.232 sample and 362(12) K for the δ = 0.509 sample from IS-T curves. The increase of δ correlates with elastic properties of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ . The upper inset of Fig. 8a indicates that the IS-T curve of δ = 0.509 sample shows an anomalous decreasing at T < 20 K with decreasing T. In general, IS for a sample, which does not show a phase transition, increases and saturates at low temperatures alike theoretical curves drawn in the upper inset of Fig. 8a. The anomalous decreasing IS indicates that there is a phase transition at T < 20 K for δ = 0.509 sample.

The appearance of the C ex are due to a transition of electronic and magnetic phase that has a predominant contribution to the thermal properties of solids at low temperatures. The C ex shows a maximum at T ≈ 10 K and decreases with increasing T and converges to zero at T ≈ 20 K. The C ex -T curve correlates with the magnetic phase transition at T N of Fe in δ = 0.509 sample.

The anomalous kink is understood as a crystallographic local structure transition in Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ .

On the basis of this comparison, we conclude that the stability of A-AF on V and c-AF on V can be switched by slight change of chemical composition, because of these quite close energies, irrespective of a magnetic phase of the Fe. Our results partially supports the work of Nakamura et al. . The subtle differences between our results and Nakamura et al`s results are caused by different exchange correlation potentials and/or initial conditions; e.g. values of magnetic moments adopted on V and Fe. Clarification of this issue requires further computational analysis on a larger magnetic supercell of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−. In a consequence of the analysis, we define a ferromagnetic (FM) phase and a Ferri. phase of the V in oxygen deficient supercells. Table 2 shows several different magnetic configurations of the V and their E for  = 0, 0.25, 0.50, provided that magnetic configurations of the Fe is fixed as s-AF. In this case, we relaxed the internal coordinates. The noticeable relaxation occurred only along the c-axis within 0.02 nm, and the relaxation trends were almost the same among each configuration. As shown in the first block of Table 2, the E of several magnetic configurations on the V layer show close values. The theoretical magnetic phases of the V exhibit similar E in A-AF, FM, c-AFs, and Ferri. phases. For oxygen-deficient conditions δ = 0.25 and 0.50, a clear difference is observed in the magnitude of the magnetic moment of the V, although the similarity of E remains the same. Upon removal of the oxygen, the V loses one of its bonded O in the supercell. Both of A-AF phase of the V for  = 0.25 and c-AF phase of the V for  = 0.50 behave as a kind of Ferri. phase. On the basis of these results, we argue that d electron is rather localized on around the V ions exhibiting magnetic moment from 1.9  B to 2.3  B . Such different magnetic moments of the V breaks the magnetic balance of the V sublattice, possibly stabilizing Ferri. phase of V. Our calculations verify that the magnetic ground states of the V are A-AF for  = 0, Ferri. for  = 0.25, and c-AF with small spontaneous magnetic moments for  = 0.50 in the virtual superlattice of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3− . The calculated stabilities of magnetic phases of the V are consistent with experimental results for  ~0, ~0.25, and ~0.50.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support a presence of several magnetic phases for the V sublattice. Provided there is a linear relation between δ and the lattice volume, a-δ and c-δ curves change systematically with δ. Bulk superconductivity are observed in the samples with 0.031 ≤ δ ≤ 0.145. The samples with 0.204 ≤ δ ≤ 0.664 show normal conductivity at T > 2 K, although SC-traces were observed in the samples with 0.204 ≤ δ ≤ 0.237. These SC-traces are mainly due to the magnetic phase segregation. The highest T c onset and T c mid were 37.1 K and 34.1 K, respectively, for δ = 0.145 sample. A spontaneous magnetic moment (M S ) of the V appears for the samples with 0.124 ≤ δ ≤ 0.631. The M S exhibits a maximum value of ~0.5  B (f.u.) −1 for δ = 0.267 sample. 0.124 ≤ δ ≤0.631 samples exhibit magnetic transition temperatures of the V ranging from 25 to 308 K.  57 Fe Mössbauer spctra of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ exhibit PM phase of the Fe sublattice for superconducting δ = 0.124 sample and normalconducting samples with δ = 0.232 and 0.237, whereas AFM phases of Fe appear at T < 11.9 K, 17.5 K, and 23.1 K for the samples with δ = 0.267, 0.509, and 0.631. Our DFT calculations show that a stable AFM phase of the V can be switched, depending on the δ, because the stability of the magnetic phases are quite similar in energy. In addition, our DFT calculations indicate that the Ferri. phase of the V is the most stable in the samples with δ = 0.25. Based on these results, an electronic and magnetic phase diagram of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ is constructed with respect to δ. This phase diagram provides an evidence that there is no coexisting AFM phase of the Fe sublattice with SC, although a higher maximum of T c appears near a boundary between the AFM and Ferri. phases of V. Magnetic and valence states of the V dominate T c of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ indirectly.

It should be noted that there are difficulties to determine quantitative oxygen contents of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ with XRF. Primary reasons are following: (i) The energy of V-Lα 1, V-Lβ 1 , and O-Kα 1 are very close in the range of 0.01 keV, which is detection limit of WDX, and the observed V-Lα 1, V-Lβ 1 and O-Kα 1 spectrum largely overlapped. Therefore, provided the spectrum of them are divided by least squares fitting, the arbitrariness of fitting inevitably occurs. (ii) The calibration of oxygen contents with V metal , V 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 (Fig. S4F(a) could not been applied to determine chemical composition of O with respect to V in Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ ,bacause the state of bonds of V and O and crystal structure of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ are different from those of V 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 . (iii) Because of the matrix effect, the relationship of peak intensity or peak area between O-Kα 1 and V-Lα 1, V-Lβ 1 of the samples Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ is opposite to that of V 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 (See Fig. S4D). (iv) Although it was possible to distinguish crystallographic phase of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ and that of impurity phase with Electron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA), it was difficult to detect O-Kα 1 spectrum with superior S/N ratio with EPMA, because the measurement range of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ crystals is ~ m order and the sufficient intensity of O-Kα 1 spectrum could been hardly detected.

The ρ of the sample decreases below our detection limit under 0 T, on the other hand, the ρ exhibits finite values at 2.above the detection limit under above 0.2 mT. This disappearance of zero resistivity under magnetic fields is possibly due to the existence of impurity phases in the grain boundary in the sample.

(f) Hole and electron mobilities used in the model calculations.  we look at the measured Hall coefficient at a tempera- ture of 5 K, shown by the circles in Fig. , we see that it varies smoothly with doping. A more sensible in- terpretation can be obtained with a model that contains contributions from both holes and electrons : where N h (N e ) is the density of holes (electrons) and b = µ e /µ h , the ratio of mobilities of the electrons and holes. As mentioned in the introduction, we know from previous transport studies that N h is finite even at x = 0, grows with x up to at least x ∼ 0.1, while ARPES studies suggest that the hole pockets continue to grow slowly at larger x. Hence, we model N h by assuming that it is small but finite at x = 0 and grows linearly with x. In contrast, we assume that the electron- like carriers correspond to impurity states introduced by In 3+ , and so we take N e to be equal to the density of In ions, as indicated in Fig. . The key to the crossover in dominant carrier type is the mobility ratio, b. We assume that the In-based states are slightly below the chemical potential of pure SnTe, and that these states are localized when x is small. As x increases, the In-induced states can hybridize with one another, so that these states can begin to contribute to the transport. We model this with a mobility ratio b that starts out small, but then grows rapidly towards one at larger x; the product N e b 2 is indicated by the dashed line in Fig. . With these choices, we obtain the solid line in Fig. , which gives a good description of R H (x). Of course, in modeling R H we have introduced more degrees of freedom than we have constraints. To test the model further, it is useful to consider the magnitude of ρ, which depends on both the carrier densities and the mobilities. The magnitude of the hole mobility is con- strained by previous work on samples with x 0.1: the mobility starts off as ∼ 500 cm 2 /(V s) at x = 0 and then rapidly drops on the introduction of In, decreasing by two orders of magnitude by x ∼ 0.1. We assume that that the hole mobility then remains constant at 5 cm 2 /(V s). Meanwhile, the electron mobility starts out at a negligi- ble level and steadily rises, becoming comparable to the hole mobility at x ∼ 0.25. Using the model mobilities plotted in Fig. together with the carrier densities shown in Fig. , we obtain for ρ the solid line plotted in Fig. , which certainly captures the trend of the experimental data points.","0"

Very recently, we discovered bulk SC at 6.1 K in a Q1D pnictide K 2 Cr 3 As 3 in which correlated Cr-3d electrons are involved. The crystal structure is characterized by the [(Cr 3 As 3 ) 2− ] ∞ double-walled subnano-tubes in which Cr 6 (As 6 ) face-sharing octahedron chains constitute the inner (outer) wall.

The calculated 'bare' density of state (DOS) at E F is less than 1/3 of the experimental value from the specific-heat measurement, confirming the electron correlation effect.

Thus, the appearance of SC in K 2 Cr 3 As 3 suggests a significant in- terchain coupling, as revealed by the existence of 3D FS. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to investigate the effect of interchain coupling by the elemental replacement (e.g., Rb for K) in the spacer columns.

In this Communication, we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and physical property measurement of an analogous material Rb 2 Cr 3 As 3 .

The normal-state C(T ) data can be better fitted using an additional term (δT 5 ) for the phonon contribution, namely, C(T ) = γ n T + βT 3 + δT 5.

To gain insight into its properties, we performed ab-initio electronic structure calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our results show that the density of states at the Fermi energy is mainly composed by V-d states. The McMillan formula predicts a superconducting critical temperature (T c ) of approximately 3.9 K, in excellent agreement with the experimental value at 4.1 K, indicating that superconductivity in this new compound may be explained by the electron-phonon mechanism. Calculated valence charge density maps clearly show directional bonding between Hf and V atoms with 1D highly populated V-chains, and some ionic character between Hf-Ga and V-Ga bonds. Finally, we have shown that there are electrons occupying two distinct bands at the Fermi level, with different characters, which supports experimental indications of possible multiband superconductivity. Based on the results, we propose the study of a related compound, ScV 2 Ga 4 , showing that it has similar electronic properties, but probably with a higher T c than HfV 2 Ga 4.","1"

Although strongly correlated systems are beyond the scope of the Kohn-Sham scheme of the DFT, many successful attempts have been made to deal with the description of superconducting materials. In particular, some specific properties of the normal state, e.g. electronic band dispersions and electronic density of states, are very useful to elucidate aspects of the superconducting mechanism and to predict relevant parameters, such as the critical temperature T c and the electron-phonon coupling constant λ. In the last few years, an increasing number of studies appeared using this methodology, either as support for experimental discoveries or fully theoretical investigations . Superconductivity was recently experimentally reported, by some of the present authors, for the HfV 2 Ga 4 compound, with a critical temperature (T c ) of 4.1 K . The investi- gators observed some deviations from the more conventional BCS theory signatures, such as an unusual inflection near T c in lower and upper critical field as a function of reduced temperature, and a second jump in the specific heat vs. temperature curve. The authors speculated that the experimental results could be either due to sample inhomogeneity or to the presence of more than one superconducting gap at the Fermi surface, resulting in a two-band superconductivity . These recent experimental results for the bulk HfV 2 Ga 4 point to a new promising class of materials to study unconventional superconducting behavior. Motivated by these results, here we perform ab-initio electronic structure calculations for HfV 2 Ga 4 . We focus our atten- tion on the analysis of the possible mechanisms behind the superconducting properties. The theoretical study was extended to a new (possibly) bulk superconducting compound with the same prototype structure, ScV 2 Ga 4 , as a way to manipulate the electronic structure aiming at enhancing the superconducting transition temperature.","1"

H c2 (T ) is here determined as the point where the resistance deviates from the linearity in the R − H 2 curves . The slope of H c2 at T c , dH c2 /dT | Tc , is obtained as −34 kOe/K. H c2 (0) can thus be estimated to be 1×10 5 Oe, using the WHH for- mula . Then, the average Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherent length ξ GL (0)=57Å can be calculated using the formula ξ GL (0)=(Φ 0 /2πH c2 (0) 1/2 . On the other hand, by solving the equation H c1 = Φ 0 ln(λ/ξ)/4πλ 2 , the average penetration depths can also be obtained: λ(0)=7900Å . Therefore, the Ginzburg-Landau param- eter κ = λ/ξ GL is estimated as ∼ 140, indicating that the cobalt oxyhydrate is an extreme type-II supercon- ductor, like the high-T c cuprates. This conclusion has also been drawn in a very recent report , in which dif- ferent method was employed to determine the H c2 (T ). It is worth while to note that, compared with the previ- ous result, the values of H c1 (0) and H c2 (0) in the present sample are remarkably smaller, which is possibly resulted from the differences in the carrier-doping level and/or the water content. The result of low-temperature specific heat measure- ment is shown in figure .

On the other hand, λ ep can be calculated to be 0.57 using the formula where Coulomb repulsion parameter µ * is assumed to be 0.13 empirically . Therefore, N (0) is derived to be 4.3 states/eV•f.u. We note that this value is almost identical to the band calculation result (4.4 states/eV•Co) for the parent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 . It is noted that the sample's magnetic susceptibility (∼ 2.0×10 −3 emu/mol-f.u) is almost temperature indepen- dent from 30 K to 300 K (not shown here).

The small positive θ value suggests the existence of weak ferromagnetic correlations. The unusually large χ 0 value should be dominantly con- tributed by χ P auli , which is probably enhanced by the Stoner-type ferromagnetic correlation.

T c vanishes again upon overdoping for p's larger than a critical value, p c ≈ 0.27 hole/Cu, where the strength of the antiferromagnetic corre- lations also vanishes . A further notion, which is gener- ally assumed to be valid is that the overdoped materials with p > p c behave more or less as conventional metals described by Fermi liquid theory.

Moreover, the ZFC dc magnetization curve is in fact a FC curve due to a small residual field ≈2 Oe trapped in the superconducting magnet. Both data set yield a ≈30% screening volume; the slightly smaller diamagnetic signal of the dc data is attributed to the comparatively higher field of 100 Oe used, which leads to a larger flux penetration. As discussed in the past , the above shielding fraction is typical for single-phase superconducting cuprates that depends upon various effects including flux pin- ning, among others. In the present case, considering the ab- sence of impurities, this fraction should be then regarded as a lower limit for the Meissner fraction.

Each added Co atom, with an average coordination number of 5, pulls in 0.5 oxygen atoms . Additionally, the Co substitution induces a trans- verse distortion of its Cu(1) site . Co atoms tend to form either small clusters like dimers or even short chains along the (110) direction . As a result, these chains pin down the twin boundaries of the or- thorhombic structure (micro-twinning) that triggers an orthorhombic-tetragonal transition for y ≥ 0.025 .

For both types of con- stant energy scans reported in , the AF response at 39 meV in the superconducting state displays a mo- mentum width (FWHM) of 0.28 ± 0.06Å −1 .

The enhance-ment of the AF response around 41 meV (the magnetic resonance peak) is visible in the raw data and it is fur- ther confirmed by the differences shown on .b. The magnetic resonance peak is not sharp in energy and can be fitted by the usual ""ansatz"" of a single Gaussian line- shape: this yields an intrinsic energy width of ∼ 9 ± 1 meV (FWHM).

This fully agrees with NQR re- sults on sample with similar Co content which show that about half the Cu(2) carry magnetic moments . Such a phase segregation scenario has some analogies with the three phase model developed to explain the Cu-NQR data . However, the magnetic correlation lengths found here (ξ > 200Å) are much bigger than the dimensions of the nucleated regions where the Cu(2) become magnetic as considered in ref. . In addition, Kohno et al. have proposed a phenomenological description of AF-SC coexistent states due to disorder in strongly correlated systems. In their model, based on Ginsburg-Landau the- ory, a key assumption is that the SC state is in competi- tion with the AF phase with a first order phase bound- ary, which enables the AF state to nucleate where SC is suppressed. For a finite concentration of impurities, the first order AF-SC boundary of the clean case is re- placed by a finite region where the SC and AF moments coexist microscopically with spatially varying order pa- rameters. It has also been proposed that an AF state can locally appear around surfaces or impurities and can co-exist with d-wave superconductivity and in particular, the local formation of an AF order parameter can easily occur near a (110) surface. The AF order in the present case could have its origin in the magnetic polarisation produced by the Co 3+ or in the structural effects related to the micro-twinning along the (110) directions or more probably, to a combination of both these effects.","0"

In the case of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO), recent angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) studies have shown that in underdoped samples, the chemical potential µ is pinned at ∼0.4 eV above the top of the lower Hubbard band (more precisely, top of the Zhang-Rice singlet band) and spectral weight is transferred from the lower Hubbard band to near µ with hole doping. Also, it has been found from the photoemission measurements of core levels that the chemical potential does not move with hole doping in the underdoped region . These observations indicate a breakdown of the rigid-band picture and are sugges- tive of a dramatic reorganization of the electronic struc- ture upon hole doping. In fact, the suppression of the chemical potential shift has been attributed to the strong stripe fluctuations in LSCO because the charge stripes can be viewed as a kind of microscopic phase separation which will pin the chemical potential. More recently, it has been found that the chemical potential in the electron-doped superconductor Nd 2−x Ce x CuO 4 (NCCO) shows a monotonous shift without any sign of suppres- sion, indicating a more rigid-band-like behavior .

It has been demonstrated that if the shifts of the metal and oxygen core levels are the same, K∆Q and ∆V M are negligibly small . Core-hole screen- ing by conduction electrons can also be excluded from the main origin of the core-level shifts in transition-metal ox- ides . As mentioned above, in the region δ > 0.1, the Bi 4f, Sr 3d and O 1s core levels show similar behaviors and therefore we can safely conclude that the shifts are primarily caused by the chemical potential shift. In the region δ < 0.1, the doping dependences of the core lev- els are complicated, most likely due to charge transfer from the CuO 2 layers (CuO 2 -Ca 1−x R x -CuO 2 blocks) to the Bi-O layers with decreasing δ and the resulting de- crease of the Bi valence. Considering the crystal chem- istry of BSCCO, the SrO layer is supposed to have fixed charges and the Sr 3d level would be least influenced by the charge transfer, and we assume that the shift of the Sr 3d level most faithfully reflects the chemical potential shift in the entire hole concentration region. Indeed, the shift of the O 1s peak from the SrO layer as well as that from the CuO 2 layer deduced from the line-shape analy- sis show nearly the same behavior and is most probably caused by the chemical potential shift. shows the chemical potential shift ∆µ relative to δ = 0 thus deduced for the Er-and Pr-substituted BSCCO samples.

In the Monte Carlo simulations , the calculated ∆µ follows ∆µ ∝ −δ 2 . The measured ∆µ in BSCCO can be relatively well fitted to −δ 2 as shown in .

Further, the shift in BSCCO is faster than that in LSCO in the entire hole concentration region. These differences indicate that the change in the elec- tronic structure from the AFI to the SC with hole dop- ing is different at least quantitatively between the two systems. In LSCO, it has been found by an ARPES study that µ is located in states which are created within the band gap of the parent insulator La 2 CuO 4 . ARPES data of underdoped BSCCO, on the other hand, appear to show a gradual upwards shift of the lower Hubbard band [around k= (π, 0)] with hole doping , indicat- ing no pinning behavior. It is highly desired to perform a systematic ARPES study lightly-doped to underdoped BSCCO.

The hole doping in the CuO 2 planes, is controlled by appropriate variation of the Ce concentration. SC occurs for Ce contents of 0.4-0.8, with the highest T C =35 K for Ce=0.6. The as-prepared non-SC EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 (x=1) sample exhibits magnetic irreversibility below T irr =125 K and orders anti-ferromagnetically (AFM) at T M =165 K. The saturation moment at 5 K is M sat =0.89 µ B /Ru close to the expected 1 µ B for the low-spin state of Ru 5+ . Annealing under oxygen pressures, does not affect these parameters, whereas depletion of oxygen shifts both T irr and T M up to 169 and 215 K respectively. Systematic magnetic studies on Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ show that T M , T irr and M sat decrease with x, and the Ce dependent magnetic-SC phase diagram is presented. A simple model for the SC state is proposed. We interpret the magnetic behavior in the framework of our ac and dc magnetic studies, and argue that: (i) the system becomes AFM ordered at T M ; (b) at T irr < T M , W-FM is induced by the canting of the Ru moments, and (c), at lower temperatures the appropriate samples become SC at T C .  The magnetic features are not affected by the SC state, and the two states coexist.","1"

The Ru-2122 materials (for R=Eu) display a magnetic transition at T M = 125-180 K and bulk SC below T C = 32-50 K (T M >T c ) depending on oxygen concentration and sample preparation . SC survives because the Ru moments probably align in the basal planes, which are practically decoupled from the CuO 2 planes, so that there is no pair breaking. Specific heat studies show a sizeable typical jump at T C and the magnitude of the ∆C/T (0.08 mJ/gK 2 ) indicates clearly the presence of bulk SC . The specific heat anomaly is independent of the applied magnetic field. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy 3 , muon-spin rotation and magneto-optic experiments have demonstrated that all materials are microscopically uniform with no evidence for spatial phase separation of superconducting and magnetic regions. That is, both states coexist intrinsically on the microscopic scale.","1"
"2352","P066024503-CC","6","In the Ru-2122 system, the W-FM state, as well as irreversibility phenomena, arise as a result of an anti-symmetric exchange coupling of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) type 3 between neighboring Ru moments, induced by a local distortion that breaks the tetragonal symmetry of the RuO 6 octahedra. Due to this DM interaction, the field causes the adjacent spins to cant slightly out of their original direction and to align a component of the moments with the direction of the applied field. Below the irreversible temperature (T irr ,), which is defined as the merging temperature of the zero-field (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) curves, the Ru-Ru interactions begin to dominate, leading to reorientation of the Ru moments, which leads to a peak in the magnetization curves. The Ce concentration affects the hole carrier concentration as a result the SC properties and the T C values of R 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ system. The remaining unresolved question concerns the effect of Ce concentration on magnetic properties of this system.

Prescribed amounts of Eu 2 O 3, CeO 2, SrCO 3, Ru and CuO were mixed and pressed into pellets and preheated at 1000° C for about 1 day at atmospheric pressure. The product was cooled, reground and sintered at 1050°C for 50 h in a slightly pressurized oxygen atmosphere (∼1.1 atm) and then furnace cooled to ambient temperature (asp samples). All the asp materials reported were prepared at the same time and under the same conditions. Part of the asp EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 sample was re-heated for 24 h at 800° C under high oxygen pressure (60 atm.) and another part was quenched from 1050° C to room temperature, denoted as hop and quenched materials, respectively. Determination of the absolute oxygen content in the asp Ru-2122 material, as well as in the hop and quenched samples, is difficult because CeO 2 is not completely reducible to a stoichiometric oxide when heated to high temperatures. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements confirmed the purity of the compounds (~97%) and indicate within the instrumental accuracy, that all samples have the same lattice parameters a=3.846(1) Å and c=28.72(1) Å, in excellent agreement with Ref. . ZFC and FC dc magnetic measurements in the range of 5-300 K were performed in a commercial (Quantum Design) super-conducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer.

The detailed crystal structure and the atomic positions Ru-2122 were studied by synchrotron X-rays diffraction and neutron diffraction 13 experiments, which show that the RuO 6 octahedra are rotated ~ 14° around the c-axis and that this rotation is essentially the same for x=1 and x=0.6 as well as for Ru-1212.

This transition width is comparable to our previous resistivity data 3,6 and with Ref.","1"
"2358","P066024503-CC","12","Such a broadening is typical of under-doped Cu based high T c materials where inhomogeneity in the oxygen concentration causes a distribution in the T c values. In addition, the SC transition width may be due to the spontaneous vortex state discussed in detail in Ref. 4. In the next section we suggest an intuitive explanation as to why the M-2122 (M= Ru, Ta and Nb) materials are superconducting. Given the variety of crystal structures and the chemical methods used to introduce holes into the CuO 2 layers, it is well established that a ""generic' electronic phase diagram can be sketched for all compounds. The hole (or carrier) density (p) in the CuO 2 planes, or deviation of the formal Cu valence from Cu 2+ , is a primary parameter, which affects T C in most of the HTSC compounds. In the well-established phase diagram La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 , the stoichiometric parent La 2 CuO 4 is AFM and insulating. The magnetic interactions are well described by a simple Heisenberg model, with a large exchange interaction (J= 1500 K) value. In La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 the charge carrier concentration, can be varied by replacing Sr 2+ for La 3+ (or by removal or addition of oxygen in YBa 2 Cu 3 O z ) . The variation of T C as a function of hole doping exhibits a bell shape behavior, with a peak for the optimally doped material (x=0.15 for La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 ). The Eu, Ce and Ru ion valencies in Eu 1.5 Ce 0.5 RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ have been studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS) and X-ray-absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques . MS performed at 90 and 300 K on 151 Eu show a single narrow line with an isomer shift of 0.69(2) mm/s, indicating that the Eu ions are trivalent with a nonmagnetic J=0 ground state. XAS taken at L III edges of Ce shows also that Ce is tetravalent. XAS taken at the K edge of Ru, at room temperature indicates clearly that the Ru ions are pentavalent . It is also apparent, that bulk SC in the M-2122 system appears only for pentavalent M ions and both Nb-2122 and Ta-2122 materials are SC with T C 28-30 K 1 .","1"
"2359","P066024503-CC","13","We argue that the RCeMSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 (R=Eu or Gd and R/Ce=1) samples serve as the parent stoichiometric insulator compounds (similar to La 2 CuO 4 ). Since the valence of R 3+ , Ce 4+ , Ru 5+ Sr 2+ Cu 2+ and O 2are conclusive, a straightforward valence counting yields a fixed oxygen concentration of 10. Hole doping of the Cu-O planes, which results in metallic behavior and SC, can be optimized with appropriate variation of the R 3+ / Ce 4+ ratio (trivalent R 3+ ions are replaced for Ce 4+ ). SC occurs for Ce contents of 0.4-0.8, and the optimally doped sample is obtained for Ce=0.6. In fact, unlike the La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 system, this substitution does not appear to significantly alter the hole concentration (p) on the Cu-O planes. This is apparent in","0"
"2360","P066024503-CC","14","which shows that the change of x from 0.8 to 0.6, results in a small increase in T C . Indeed, if all the carriers were induced into the Cu-O planes, then for the under doped (x=0.8) to the optimally doped (x=0.6) samples, p should vary by 0.2 and result in a large shift in T C , as observed in La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 and in other HTSC materials. It is thus possible, that in all M-2122 compounds, the extra holes introduced by reducing the Ce content, the next section deals with its detailed magnetic behavior. (b) The effect of oxygen on the magnetic behavior of EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 is not SC and is only magnetically ordered .

"2361","P066024503-CC","15","The two curves merge at T irr =125 K. Note the ferromagnetic-like shape of the FC branches. T M (Ru) is not at T irr . The M/H(T) curves do not lend themselves to an easy determination of T M (Ru), and T M (Ru)=165 K, was obtained directly from the temperature dependence of the saturation moment (M sat ), discussed below. [An alternative way to determine T M (Ru) is to cool the material from above T M , under a small negative magnetic field (say -5 Oe), which aligns the Ru sublattice. At low temperatures, a small positive (5 Oe) is applied. Due to the high anisotropy, the Ru moments remain opposite the field direction up to T M . The measured negative M(T) curve becomes zero at T M ]. T irr is field dependent, and shifted to lower temperatures with the applied field. T irr =91, 64, 39, 28 and 14 K for H= 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Oe respectively. For higher external fields the irreversibility is washed out, and both ZFC and FC curves collapse to a single ferromagnetic-like behavior. It appears that the magnetic properties of Ru in EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 are all enhanced, as compared to the asp Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ samples with x<1. The effect of Ce concentration on the magnetic parameters of the Ru sublattice will be discussed below. Similar M/H(T) curves were performed to the oxygen annealed (hop) sample, and Fig. 3 shows that both T irr and T M (Ru) remain unchanged. This is in contrast to Eu 1.5 Ce 0.5 RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ where annealing under the same oxygen pressure affects T irr and T M (Ru) and shift them to higher temperatures 6 . As stated above, the oxygen concentration in EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 is fixed and does not change during the annealing process. On the other hand, during the quenching process, a small amount of oxygen is depleted and both T irr and T M (Ru) are shifted to 169 and 215 K respectively (Fig. 3). It reminiscent of the magnetic phase-diagram of YBa 2 Cu 3 O z (z<6.5), where the depletion of oxygen increases the magnetic transition of the CuO 2 planes. M(H) measurements at various temperatures for the asp, hop and quenched samples have been carried out, and the results obtained for the asp sample are exhibited in Figs. the W-FM contribution of the Ru sub lattice, and H is the linear paramagnetic contribution of Eu and Cu). The saturation moment obtained at 5 K is M sat = 0.89(1)µ B . Similar M(H) curves have been measured at various temperatures and Fig. 5 (inset) shows the decrease of M sat with temperature. M sat becomes zero at T M (Ru)=165(2). Similar M sat and T M (Ru) values were obtained for the hop material. However, for the quenched material, the saturation moment at 5 K remains unchanged, but T M is shifted to 215 (2) K. Thus, only the magnetic transitions are sensitive to the oxygen concentration. The measured M sat = 0.89µ B , is somewhat smaller than the fully saturated moment 1µ B expected for the low-spin state of Ru 5+ , i.e. gµ B S for g=2 and S=0.5. This means that a small canting on adjacent Ru spins occurs, and the saturation moments are not the full moments of the Ru 5+ ions. The exact nature of the local structural distortions causing DM exchange coupling in Ru-2122 (see above) is not presently known. At low applied fields, the M(H) curve exhibits a typical ferromagnetic-like hysteresis loop (Fig. 6) similar to that reported in Ref. 3. The positive virgin curve at low fields, indicates clearly that SC is totally suppressed, Two other characteristic parameters of the hysteresis loops are shown in Fig. 6, namely, the remanent moment, (M rem = 0.41µ B /Ru) and the coercive field (H C = -190 Oe at 5 K). This M rem is much larger than M rem =0.035 µ B obtained for EuSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 12 . The same M rem and H C values (at 5 K) were obtained for the hop and quenched materials. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of M rem (5 K) which disappears at T irr . The large M rem (0.41µ B at 5 K) in relation to the saturation moment (M sat = 0.89µ B ) is consistent with ferromagnetic-like order in EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 , although neutron diffraction measurements are required to precisely determine the nature of the magnetic order. M(H) curves measured at various temperatures yield the M rem (T) and H C (T) values which are plotted in Fig. 5 (inset). For both the asp and quenched samples M rem (T) also disappear at T irr , and H C (T) become zero around 80 K and 130 K respectively (Fig. 5). Above T M (Ru), the (T) curve at 10 kOe, for asp EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 has the typical paramagnetic shape and adheres closely to the Curie-Weiss (CW) law: χ =χ 0 +C/(T-θ), where χ 0 is the temperature independent part of χ, C is the Curie constant, and θ is the CW temperature. The net paramagnetic Ru contribution to (T), was obtained by subtracting (T) of EuCeNbSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 (the reference material) from the measured data. This procedure yields: χ 0 =0.0063 and C=0.57(1) emu/mol Oe and θ= 146(1) K, which corresponds to an effective moment P eff =2.13 µ B . θ obtained, is in fair agreement with T M , but P eff is greater than the expected value of the low-spin state of Ru 5+ and S=0.5 (P eff =1.73 µ B ). (c) The effect of Ce on the magnetic behavior of Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ δ δ δ As stated above, the compounds described here have been prepared simultaneously under the same conditions. Since the magnetic properties of the Ru-2122 system depend strongly on oxygen concentration 6 , the data presented here differ slightly from those reported in our previous publications. ZFC and FC magnetic as well as isothermal M(H) measurements, have been performed on all Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ (x=0.4-1) compounds. Generally speaking, the magnetic behavior of all materials is quite similar to these described in Figs 3-6 and for the sake of brevity, we display the data obtained for x=0.1 and x=0.5 . It is readily observed, that for x=1, the magnetic properties due to the Ru are all enhanced, as compared to the x=0.5. The latter sample is SC and its ZFC branch starts from negative moments. The inflection in the FC branch agrees well with T c determined from the ac curve . The absence of a complete Meissner effect in the Ru-2122 system is discussed in length elsewhere.","0"

M sat values at 5 K, increase gradually with x, M sat =0.43, 0.46, 0.60 0.67 and 0.86µ B for x=0.4, 0.6, 0.7 0.8 and 0.9 respectively. It is apparent that this trend is not affected by the SC state which is induced for x=0.8. Due to the presence of a tiny amount of SrRuO 3 in the x=0.4 sample (not detectable by XRD), its T M was not determined. In the paramagnetic range, the parameters extracted using the CW law, have been obtained by subtracting the paramagnetic moment of the relevant Nb-2122 compound, as described above.","0"

(d) The qualitative magnetic structure of Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ δ δ δ All magnetic parameters (such as T M , T irr and M sat ) are shifted to higher values with increasing Ce. Our general picture is that in Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ all compounds have a similar magnetic structure. We assume that the small difference between Eu 3+ and Ce 4+ ionic radii discussed above, decreases the mean Ru-Ru distance, and as a result the magnetic exchange interactions become stronger with Ce. While our data described here do not include any determination of the magnetic structural order of the Ru sublattice in Ru-2122, the results are compatible with a simple model which is, however, of use in understanding the qualitative features at low applied fields. Starting from high to low temperatures, the magnetic behavior is basically divided into 4 regions. (i) At elevated temperatures, the paramagnetic net Ru moment is well described by the CW law, and the extracted P eff =2.15 µ B and θ=134-146 K values, practically do not alter with Ce. (ii) At T M (depends on Ce content Fig. 8) which is deduced directly from the temperature dependence M sat , the Ru sub lattice becomes AFM ordered. (iii) At T irr < T M , which is Ce dependent ) and also varies with the external field, a weak ferromagnetism is induced, which originates from canting of the Ru moments. T irr is defined as the merging point of the low field ZFC and FC branches, or alternatively, at the temperature in which the remanent moment disappears. This canting arises from the DM anti-symmetric super-exchange interaction, which by symmetry, follows from the fact that the RuO 6 octahedra tilt away from the crystallographic c axis . At high magnetic field (H>3000 Oe) the irreversibility is washed out and the M(T) curves exhibit a ferromagnetic-like behavior.(iv) At lower temperatures SC is induced. shows that T C depends strongly on the R 3+ /Ce 4+ (as hole carriers) and on oxygen concentrations . Below T C , both SC and weak-ferromagnetic states coexist 3,10 and the two states are practically decoupled. This model is supported by our unpublished non-linear ac susceptibility measurements, which show non-linear signals up to T M , and also from Mossbauer studies on 57 Fe doped material 17 . However, the present interpretation, differs completely from the phase separation of AFM and FM nano-domain particle scenario, suggested in Ref 16. Neutron diffraction measurements are required to precisely determine the nature of the magnetic order in the Ru-2122 system. In conclusion, the magnetic insulator parent EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 (x=1), is used to describe the coexistence of both SC and weak-ferromagnetism states in Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ (x=0.4-1). For x=1 (δ=0), annealing under high oxygen pressure does not affect the magnetic properties, whereas T M is enhanced by oxygen depletion. Hole doping of the Cu-O planes, which results in SC, can be optimized with appropriate variation of the Eu 3+ / Ce 4+ ratio and the optimally doped material is obtained for Ce=0.6. The magnetic structure of all materials studied is practically the same, but the magnetic parameters, such as T M and M sat , decrease with decreasing Ce content. Two steps in the magnetic behavior are presented. At T M ranging from 125 K (for x=0.5) to165 K (for x=1) all materials become AFM ordered. At T irr (depends on Ce) a W-FM state is induced, originating from canting of Ru moments. This canting arises from the DM anti-symmetric super-exchange interaction and follows from the fact that the RuO 6 octahedra tilt away from the crystallographic c axis. A direct magnetic structure determination by neutron diffraction or 99 Ru Mossbauer spectroscopy studies are warranted to confirm our assumptions.","0"

Superconductivity is demonstrated by microwave, resistivity and Meissner-effect measurements. Both polycrystalline powders and thin-film samples were studied. A thin film showed a resistance transition with an onset temperature of 16 K and essen- tially zero resistance near 5 K. Bulk samples showed a well-defined Meissner effect and magnetic-field-dependent microwave absorp- tion beginning at 18 K. The onset of superconductivity at 18 K is the highest yet observed for a molecular superconductor.","1"

Since the average distance between CuO 2 planes is reduced due to the absence of the charge reservoir block, the interlayer coupling is expected to be very strong, which should strengthen the superconductivity. However, T c is only about 43 K, and neither the size of ionic radius, the magnetic moment, nor the concentration of Ln ions at Sr sites affects T c . Moreover, the oxygen is very stoichiometric; neither vacancies nor interstitial oxygen exists. So far, the study of superconductivity in these compounds has been hindered by the lack of high quality bulk samples. However, in the case of infinite-layer superconducting films, superconducting transition temperature is much lower than those of bulk samples. For an infinite-layer superconducting film of (Sr 1−x Nd x )CuO 2 , the T c is reduced by about one half.

Our finding for (Sr 0.9 ,La 0.1 )CuO 2 seems to be the next step. Two kinds of representative n-type cuprates show similar behaviors for the substitution effect on T c , Ni killing the superconductivity faster than Zn. How- ever the difference is that the substitution effect in (Sr 0.9 ,La 0.1 )CuO 2 is much closer to those in conventional superconductors with respect to the exact value of the T c reduction rate dT c /dx. Impurity substitution effects in hole-doped cuprates and electron-doped cuprates have been discussed in terms of the superconducting gap symmetry, d-wave and s- wave, respectively . Phase-sensitive Josephson tunneling or the presence of a half flux quantum at the center of the tricrystal ring could be a direct test of d-wave superconductivity, but would require high-quality thin films, which have not been feasible for infinite-layer superconductors due to difficulties in film growth. In ad- dition, the pairing symmetry of the (Nd,Ce) 2 CuO 4 com- pound remains to be controversial. Many experimental observations indicate that (Sr 0.9 ,La 0.1 )CuO 2 has properties which are the most similar to those of conventional superconductors. This compound was reported to have more 3-dimensional su- perconductivity with the c-axis coherence length, even near zero temperature, being larger than the c-axis lat-tice constant. The undoped antiferromagnetic insu- lator Ca 0.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 2 has been reported to have more 3-dimensional magnetic coupling and that material has been reported to have a stronger 3-dimensional character than other parent insulators of cuprate superconductors, such as YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 , La 2 CuO 4 , and Sr 2 CuO 2 Cl 2 . For example, an estimate of the ratio of the out-of-plane to the in-plane coupling constants for Ca 0.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 2 was two to three orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding values for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 and La 2 CuO 4 . A very recent observation of scanning tunneling spectra in (Sr 0.9 ,La 0.1 )CuO 2 support the existence of an s-wave gap with a superconducting gap ∆ ∼ 13 meV, as well as the absence of pseudogap. IV. SUMMARY We found that in electron-doped infinite-layer super- conductors Sr 0.9 La 0.1 Cu 1−x R x O 2 , substitution of the nonmagnetic Zn ion in the CuO 2 plane hardly suppress T c (dT c /dx ≤ 0.5 K/% for x ≤ 0.03) while substitution of the magnetic Ni ion kills the superconductivity at only x ∼ 0.02 (dT c /dx ≥ 20 K/%). This behavior is sim- ilar to that observed for conventional superconductors. This behavior is also consistent with many recent obser- vations, such as the existence of s-wave gap, the stronger 3-dimensionality in superconducting and antiferromag- netic properties.","0"

Let us begin this paper by re- viewing something rather old. La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 (LBCO) and La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) show the local minimum of T c around x ∼ 0.12 1,2 . It has been predicted that the disappearance in LBCO or suppression in LSCO of the superconductivity is correlated with the structural change : the structural phase transition from the mid- temperature orthorhombic phase (OMT, the space group Bmab) to the low-temperature tetragonal phase (TLT, the space group P4 2 /ncm) in LBCO and the precursor of the transition in LSCO around x = 0.12 . This prediction is verified by analysis of the crystal structure in Rare-earth doped LSCO system, which undergoes the structural phase transition to the TLT phase . In addition to the disappearance or the suppression of the superconductivity, the two related phenomena appear in these system. One is magnetic order , and the second is anomalous changes of transport properties, such as the Hall coefficient and the thermoelectric power . It is suggested that the suppression of the superconductivity around x = 0.12 will be related with not only the crystal structure but also changes in magnetic and electronic states.","0"
"2424","P066104528-CC","3","The recent development on this problem is followed from the ""stripe model"" . According to this model, the long-range modulated charge and spin ordering is stabilized in the TLT phase. Afterwards, magnetic superlattice peaks are observed by neutron diffraction in the orthorhombic superconducting phase La 1.88 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 single crystal, while no peaks associ- ated with the charge ordering have been observed . Notwithstanding no signal of the charge ordering by scattering technique, the magnetic order affects the character of the superconductivity in LSCO around x = 0.12 . Therefore, a change in electronic states must appear more or less in case of the orthorhombic phase. It is necessary for full-understanding of this problem to discuss changes in the electronic state and in the crystal structure by investigating the detailed behavior of the transport properties of so-called stripe phase in the TLT phase and of the magnetically ordered state in the OMT phase. More recently, Noda et al. reported the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient in the stripe phase La 2−x−y Nd y Sr x CuO 4 21 . However, the detailed behavior of the Hall coefficient at low temperature below 25 K is unknown yet. In this paper, we report the experimental results of the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient at low temperatures and under high magnetic fields in the TLT and in the OMT phase.","0"

In the orthorhombic LSCO, only the gradual decrease in R H is observed below 50 K which is far above T c =27 K, but no sign reversal is detected. These experimental results seem to be commonplace, since the anomalous change of R H is observed in the TLT phase but not in the OMT phase and R H in the TLT phase goes to zero in low temperatures as expected in the simplified stripe model . In 9 T, however, the sign reversal of R H in low temperatures is enhanced. In LYSCO, the temperature range where the sign is negative spreads and the absolute value at minimum point becomes larger, though the temperature where R H begins to fall is not changed in 9 T.

Gibb's phase rule (for a two-component system) is violated if a variable Mg vacancy content in MgB 2 and the expected impurity phase both appear under equilibrium conditions at constant T and P. Serquis et al. analyzed the Mg vacancy content and lattice strain in a series of MgB 2 samples using x-ray Rietveld analysis.

Single crystal x-ray diffraction of samples grown under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions also showed a 4% Mg vacancy concentration.

Bordet et al. suggested that variations in Mg vacancy concentration could explain large differences reported for the pressure dependence of T c . A number of authors have speculated that Mg deficiency could explain the depressed T c 's observed in thin films. Conversely, other authors have concluded that accidental impurity doping was a more likely explanation for differences among samples. Recently, Ribeiro et al. investigated the effect of B purity on transport properties.

Using their result, a thermal gradient of about 400 o C would be required to have MgB 4 at the hotter sample top and Mg at the cooler crucible bottom. This thermal gradient is not possible, thus the increasing MgB 4 content is most likely due to the lower Mg vapor pressure at the top surface of the sample due to reaction with residual oxygen in the furnace or Mg volatility. This conclusion is supported by the observation of black MgB 4 present on the top surface of the reaction product after the 8hr reaction time.","0"

This allows phase rules to be invoked in interpreting the data. A reaction time of two hours was used for the composition dependant studies.

No MgO was found in the diffraction analysis. This places an upper limit of about 2% on the amount of any oxygen contamination of the sample. Any Mg present at the bottom of the crucible was also transferred into the sample container for diffraction analysis. As expected, the dominate impurity in the Mg rich samples is Mg and in the Mg deficient samples is MgB 4 . However, for the reasons discussed above, there is no point around x=1 at which a single phase is found. The extrapolation of the Mg and MgB 4 concentrations to zero should show the single phase composition or single phase region of the phase diagram. The least squares fits of the impurity contents extrapolated to zero concentration give Mg 1.00 B 2 and Mg 1.01 B 2 for Mg deficient and Mg excess starting compositions, respectively. Based on only these data, the single phase composition could be on the slightly Mg rich side of the phase diagram or, conversely, a small region of variable nonstoichiometry could exist with up to 1% excess of Mg (or a deficiency of B).

The site occupancy is constant, within our experimental accuracy, over the entire phase range investigated. The refined value for the Mg site occupancy is not conclusive evidence that Mg vacancies actually exist. In the Rietveld refinement, Mg site deficiency could be mimicked by chemical substitution on either the Mg or B site (by elements with appropriately different scattering lengths) or by a failure of the Rietveld refinement code to correctly model the anharmonic thermal motion of the B atoms. The latter problem would be expected to yield artificially increased values for both the site occupancy and harmonic temperature factor of B, consistent with our observation of apparent Mg deficiency. Such systematic errors could explain the disagreement between the refined Mg-site occupancy ) and the slight Mg excess found in the chemical phase analysis for the single phase, or single phase region, of the phase diagram . However, the Mg excess required for the single phase composition found in the phase analysis can also be accounted for by a slight loss of Mg during the synthesis. This could occur due to volatilization and (or) reaction with oxygen (as was shown to occur in the time dependant investigation). Our overall conclusion is that a vacancy content of up to 1% at the Mg site cannot be ruled out. More importantly, the refined Mg site occupancy does not vary with starting composition; in particular there is no rapid change in site occupancy at or near x=1 that would indicate solid solution behavior over a small range of starting compositions. Thus, at this temperature, MgB 2 is a line compound. shows the lattice constants as a function of x for the various samples and shows the c/a ratio. The large scatter in the data points for the a-and c-axis lattice constants, much larger than the statistical errors of the profile fitting as measured by the size of the lattice points, is due to random instrumental errors, e.g. sample positioning. These errors are removed for lattice constant ratios, thus the c/a ratio show in has higher accuracy than the individual lattice constants. There is a rapid drop in c and c/a across the single phase region around x=1. The a-axis shows an almost linear dependence on Mg content. The c-axis changes by almost a factor of 3.5 more than the a-axis, thus the c/a ratio mimics the change in the c-axis. This rapid decrease in c/a at the nominal single phase composition could be interpreted as evidence for a Mg-vacancy solid solution region in the material, if one ignores the constant refined value for the Mg site occupancy.

Our hypothesis is that some of the Mg metal is distributed on the grain boundaries that separate individual crystallites, allowing stress relaxation on these boundaries. We note a report of Mg in grain boundaries of sintered MgB 2 samples observed by analytical electron microscopy, consistent with this hypothesis. In the intermediate regime, from Mg 0.9 B 2 to Mg 1.1 B 2 , the amount of impurity phase, whether Mg metal or MgB 4 , is small enough that the behavior is dominated by grain interaction stresses among the randomly oriented MgB 2 crystallites. Because of these stresses, upon cooling from the synthesis temperature, the MgB 2 crystallites are inhibited from realizing the full anisotropy of the intrinsic thermal expansion, which is twice as large along the c axis than along the a axis . Instead, the c-axis thermal expansion is slightly reduced and the a-axis thermal expansion is slightly increased.

In this regard, we note that chemical substitution may provide an alternative explanation for the 4% Mg vacancy concentration observed in single- crystal x-ray diffraction studies of MgB 2 crystals grown at high pressure from the Mg-B-N system. In particular, incorporation of N at the B site would raise the x-ray scattering cross section of that site, leading to an indication of Mg deficiency in a refinement that assumed only B on the B site. A more precise determination of the composition may be possible by exploiting the different scattering contrasts in a joint neutron and x-ray diffraction study or by pyctnometric measurements of the density of single crystals.

It is now generally agreed that the hole doped HTSC (HDHTSC) have a d-wave superconducting order parameter, show a normal state pseudogap for low hole doping and exhibit a non-Korringa relationship between the Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate and the Cu Knight shift. This non-Korringa behavior has been attributed to the Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate being dominated by coupling to antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The situation in the electron- doped HTSC (EDHTSC), based on R 2-x Ce x CuO 4 (R is a rare earth), is not so clear. There are conflicting reports concerning the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that a pseudogap exists when superconductivity is suppressed by high magnetic fields but only for temperatures less than ~25 K or there exists a pseudogap in the normal state for temperatures up to 300 K. The understanding of the spin dynamics is hampered by the magnetic rare earth atom, which is believed to dominate the spin-lattice relaxation.

Furthermore, the superconducting transition temperature, T c , is much higher (~40 K ) than that in the other EDHTSC, R 2-x Ce x CuO 4 , where superconductivity exists for lower temperatures of <25 K and the occurrence of superconductivity and the Meissner fraction depends upon aggressive annealing at high temperatures in a reducing atmosphere. The one disadvantage of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is that it must be made using a high pressure synthesis technique and incorrect synthesis can lead to site disorder, the partial formation of the 1D antiferromagnetic insulator, SrCuO 2 , as well as the antiferromagnetic insulator, La 2 CuO 4 .","1"

Thus, in conventional metals one usually finds a low temperature thermopower showing a linear temperature diffusion component and a cubic temperature phonon drag component, while at higher temperatures the drag contribution is inversely dependent on the temperature.

The 63 Cu NMR spectrum at 14.1 T contains a narrow region of 1.4 MHz in extent and a broad weaker region extending to ±6 MHz. It is clear that the broadening of the central peak is little affected by second order nuclear quadrupole broadening in contrast to the HDHTSC.

The weaker broad signal is likely to be due to the +1/2↔+3/2 and -1/2↔-3/2 satellite transitions and a distribution of nuclear quadrupole frequencies. We estimate, from the NMR spectra at different magnetic fields, that the average nuclear quadrupole frequency is less than 3 MHz. This is significantly smaller than that observed in the HDHTSC (16 MHz to 40 MHz ). However it is comparable to the upper estimate of the nuclear quadrupole frequency in superconducting samples of the EDHTSC, Nd 2-x Ce x CuO 4 (< 2 MHz ), and it is consistent with the estimates from two previous studies on Sr 1-x La x CuO 2 with x>=0.07 (<~3 MHz ).","0"

However, S(T) can be fitted to the thermopower model developed for the HDHTSC where the thermopower is modeled in terms of a diffusion term and a phonon drag term. Consequently, a previous interpretation of the thermopower data from Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 thin films in terms of phonon mediated pairing is inappropriate. The 63 Cu Knight shift from the EDHTSC, Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is much smaller than from the HDHTSC with the same T c, which we interpret in terms of a much smaller DOS at the Fermi level.

The Hao-Clem model is a variational calculation developed originally for the Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ system and it was shown to describe the magnetization curves, well for both Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ 9 and La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ system. In the La 1.90 Sr 0.10 CuO 4+δ studies, it also was found that the normal state back- ground magnetization follows a 2D Heisenberg model 10 for the Cu spins with values close to those measured previously by Nakano and coworkers. In addition, this x = 0.10 sample showed a vortex fluctuation contribution to the magnetization 12 close to T c . The presence of these fluctuations limits the temperature range of applicabil- ity of Hao-Clem because they introduce a new term in the free energy. We only use Hao-Clem in regions where these fluctuations do not contribute significantly. At low temperature irreversibility of the magnetization prevents equilibrium magnetization measurements and close to T c, fluctuations make Hao-Clem inapplicable. Even so, there is a window for each x-value where Hao-Clem works well and thermodynamic critical fields can be measured.","0"

Single crystals from three different sources, however, have given essentially the same result as the powders. Magnetically aligned samples were prepared by grinding appropriate amounts of La 2 O 3 , SrCO 3 and CuO in an agate mortar and pestle. Mixed and ground powders were pressed into pellets, placed in an alumina boat, and initially fired for 24h at 750 • C. This was followed by grinding, pelletizing, and firing several times at 850 • C and 970 • C for 48 and 72h respectively. After several cy- cles at these temperatures, the grinding, pelletizing and sintering was done at successively higher temperatures of 1000 • C, 1050 • C, and 1100 • C in a tube with oxygen flowing at 2.5cm 3 /min for 24h each time.

However, the zero thermopower value, S=0, was found when the Fermi level lies on the saddle point. In this case, the Fermi surface becomes electron-like on the OD side, which is not in agreement with photoemission measurements . The negative electron-like diffusion thermopower and positive hole-like Hall coefficient in OD region can be explained within a tight-binding band model of the CuO 2 square lattice involving VHS . The two-faced electron character in the perpendicular and parallel directions to the Fermi surface is in good agreement with the observed hole- like FS in the strongly OD region . However, the Sommerfeld expansion used in reference gives rise to a linear-T variation of S diff (T). The more accurate procedure, taking into account a rapid variation of the DOS in a few k B T (Fermi window) around Fermi level, leads to the deviation of the thermopower from this metallic behavior . The obtained curvature of S(T) (when VHS lies around 5 meV below Fermi level) is less pronounced and has a smaller slope α∼0.1 µV/K than in our case for the most overdoped sample (δ=0.18). One recent theoretical work takes into account the different contributions to the thermopower along the MY (0,π)→(π,π) direction where band dispersion is very narrow with a low Fermi velocity v f (hot states) and along the ΓY (0,0)→(π,π) direction with wide band dispersion and high v f (cold states) . The slope α, principally controlled by the density of states in the cold region, is still smaller (α∼0.08 µV/K) than our determined values for strongly OD states. The evaluated S(T) in the OD region shows also deviations from T-linear behavior, but even less pronounced than in the previous model.","0"

The increasing of susceptibility with doping, observed on samples with the same composition , indicates an enhancement of the DOS value at the Fermi level. This again emphasizes the growing narrow band properties, in good agreement with the increasing slope of the DOS seen in (b). In the absence of a detailed evolution of band dispersions in the OD region, our measurements suggest a rapid approaching of the Fermi level to the van Hove singularity with doping and the expected topological change from hole-like to electron-like Fermi surface for slightly higher hole number (p>0.28). We should note, however, that the possible difference between experimental results and the above theoretical calculations could also arise from the incommensurate superstructure in the BiO layer and the related umklapp scattering .","0"

Theoret- ically, the main problem has been finding an adi- abatic connection between the antiferromagnetic order and superconducting order in the quasi two- dimensional (2D) CuO 2 planes upon hole dop- ing. On the antiferromagnetic insulating side, the t-J model, 1 which is derived from the Hubbard model, 2 has been believed to capture the essen- tial physics of CuO 2 planes. As the system is doped with holes, Anderson proposed 3 that the Mott-Hubbard insulator becomes a 2D Luttinger liquid where the spin and charge of electrons are separated into spinons and holons. Later, a philo- sophically different SO(5) theory was proposed by which is a microscopic model with a five-component order parameter that embraces both the antiferromagnetic order corresponding to a charge zero, spin 1 particle-hole pair at half- filling (p = 0) and the superconducting order cor- responding to a charge ± 2e cooper pair spin sin- glet away from half-filling. Experimentally, be- sides antiferromagnetism and superconductivity, spin clusters, spin glass and a highly elusive hole concentration (p)-independent pseudogap in spin excitation and charge spectra are observed in the normal state. Based on the observed rich phys- ical phenomena, a generic electronic phase dia- gram has been generated as a function of tem- perature and hole concentration. Although it is widely recognized that studying this phase dia- gram holds the key to understand the cuprate physics, until now no theory has been able to account for the mere existence of such a phase diagram.","0"

This p s = 1/16 corresponds to a previously reported critical hole concentration (p c ) which dictates the doping ef- ficiency and signals a chemical potential jump of the doped holes. This p c = 1/16 is also the point where superconductivity first appears in the phase diagram. In we present the onset T c vs. p curves of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ for x = 0, 0.015, and 0.05. The T c is defined as the onset tem- perature of the Meissner effect.

While a single 30K transition is observed for x = 0 samples, a dramatic increase of T c from ∼ 15K to ∼ 30K is clearly seen for both x = 0.015 and 0.05 samples. In particular, for the x = 0.015 sample it is remarkable to observe an almost dis- continuous jump from T c ∼ 16K to 26K by a very small change of carrier concentration ∆p = 0.004 near p c . Since p c = 1/16 is a special carrier con- centration related to a possible electronic phase instability, far-infrared studies of the x = 0.015 sample at various p across p c provides a unique opportunity to investigate the specific role of this instability to the normal state charge dynamics and to the occurrence of the superconductivity in cuprates.","1"

We noted that the Meissner effect signal size of δ = 0.032 sam- ple is larger than that of δ = 0.024 sample. This result indicates that the superconducting state in the δ = 0.032 sample is not due to the forma- tion of oxygen-rich phase.

However, in this event the entire spectral weight is expected to move to the collective mode of the SDW because the dynamic mass of the SDW is the free elec- tron mass. That is, we do not expect to have the single particle excitation peak.

Therefore, the coexistence of a pinned CDW and metallic conductivity demands a channel for coherent charge transport. In order to defy all the scattering with the CuO 2 phonons, the free carriers must ""ride"" the density wave. In the case of a one-dimensional CDW, forma- tion of topological charged solitons (phase kinks) is a possibility. However, because of the topo- logical nature of the solitons, it requires that both soliton and antisoliton must hop to the neighboring CDW chains to transport charges. Therefore, the observed coherent charge trans- port will not take place through the soliton hop- ping mechanism. In the stripe model, each stripe in the CuO 2 plane is considered as a river of charge and conducting. Hence, no charge gap or pinned collective modes are expected.

We can now formally relate our low temperature results to the high temperature special carrier concentra- tion. It seems that this instability survives to low temperature and we suggest that all the doped holes in the CuO 2 plane are condensed to form a (4x4) square Wigner lattice with sides L = 4a (a = Cu-Cu distance). Then, the observed sharp Drude-like free-carrier conductivity in this insu- lating Wigner lattice ground state comes from the coherent charge transport of the excess holes ∆p = p c ∼ 0.0005 per copper which corresponds to ∼ 0.8% of the total carriers in δ = 0.024 sam- ple. In order to achieve such a coherent trans- port of charges, the free-carriers must reside in a state where the scattering with the phonons of the CuO 2 lattice can be avoided. That is, the free carriers need to ""ride"" the Wigner lattice. In a square lattice model, when an excess hole is intro- duced to the Wigner lattice, it will find an ener- getically lowest location on the lattice. Because of the on-site Coulomb repulsion at the lattice sites, the minimum energy location would be the center of the square lattice. At this location, the excess hole seats in a local harmonic potential with a zero point energy. This hole now may move be- cause it ""sees"" a periodic harmonic potential in the directions of the neighboring identical energy minima. This causes the zero point energy of the excess holes to be broadened into a band with the width of which is density dependent. This band is gapped by the Coulomb interaction energy at the minimum energy site. For charge carriers in the Coulomb band, the main energy dissipation chan- nel for electrons is through the scattering with acoustic phonons of the Wigner lattice. At high temperatures, there exists possible promotion of holes from the Wigner lattice site to an intersti- tial position and vice versa. A similar idea of an interstitial band has been discussed by de Wette for a three-dimensional electron Wigner lattice. In this band picture, we anticipate two absorp- tion peaks in addition to the transition across the single particle excitation gap: One due to the transition (ω 1 ) from the Coulomb band to the single particle excited state and the other in- volves the transition from the ground state to the Coulomb band (ω 2 ). However, the ω 2 transition from the ground state to the Coulomb band re- quires an energy across the gap less the Coulomb energy change in the lattice which is essentially the same as the static Coulomb energy difference between the occupied lattice site and the intersti- tial lattice site. We suggest that ω 2 is of the order of ∼ 0.012 eV (∼ 100 cm −1 ) as seen in the oxy- gen gas effusion experiments. This implies that the Coulomb energy difference between the occu- pied lattice site and the interstitial lattice site is ∼ 0.025 eV. Therefore, we identify the 90 cm −1 peak with ω 1 with a full width W c ∼ 200 cm −1 (0.025 eV) and the Coulomb band gap is ∼ 300 cm −1 . Note that ω 1 and ω 2 are quite close.","0"

Using the experimentally estimated oscillator strengths, we found m * ∼ 170 m e at 300 K, ∼ 80 m e at 150 K and ∼ 60 m e at 30 K. This implies that the density waves develop the long- range order at T > 150 K by drawing its strength from the single particle excitations. We shall see later in the oscillator strength vs. T plot that the crossover occurs at T 0 ∼ 200 K. However, we believe that m* is underestimated from the experimental data because the measured reflec- tivity for frequencies above 400 cm −1 is less than true reflectivity due to the ceramic nature of the sample. In addition, symmetric band is assumed to take into account of the spectral weight above 0.5 eV. Fitting for each peak was made using a symmetric Gaussian function as an approxima- tion without taking into account of asymmetry. The Debye frequency (ω D ) of the Wigner lat- tice can be estimated within the harmonic ap- proximation as ω D ≈ (e 2 /ǫ 0 m * L 3 ) 1/2 ∼ 42 cm −1 (∼ 7.8 x 10 12 s −1 ) which gives the Debye temper- ature (θ D ) of 60 K with ǫ 0 ∼ 10, the static di- electric constant of the underlying CuO 2 lattice, and m * ∼ 60m e . Therefore, we expect the linear T-dependence down to 0.2θ D ∼ 12 K 29 since the main energy dissipation channel for electrons is the scattering with the acoustic phonons of the Wigner lattice. Through the oscillator strength calculation, we found only ∼ 0.42 % of the doped carriers are contributing to the Drude-like con- ductivity at T = 300 K which is consistent with the value estimated from the plasma frequency. This is 50% of the available free carriers at p = 0.063 doping. At 300 K, the other 50% may occupy the single particle excited states of the Wigner lattice that might contribute to the inco- herent background conductivity. The deviation from the linear T-dependence of the resistivity in under-doped cuprates is due to additional scat- tering with the lattice defects and domain bound- aries whose fluctuation is dynamic as the Wigner lattice formation is not complete at finite temper- atures. σ 1 (ω) of δ = 0.032 sample, which undergoes the superconducting transition at T c ∼ 26 K, is dis- played in .

Since we know that the δ = 0.032 sample is right at the fast transition region from a T c ∼ 15K state to a T c ∼ 30K state. It is plausible that the observed σ 1 (ω) of δ = 0.032 sample comes from two different contributions; one comes from the T c = 16 K phase (LT c ) seen in δ = 0.024 sample and the other from the T c = 30 K phase (HT c ). Then, the two new features belong to HT c phase and have their origin in a different Wigner lattice ground state.

That is, the degree of commensuration has been decreased by a factor of two and the cor- responding Goldstone mode ω GH = 2ω GL . We suggest that the physical origin of the so-called p = 1/8 anomaly lies in the fact that at p = 1/8, the entire holes in the cuprate participate in form- ing the HT c phase Wigner lattice.

The interaction energy between two electrons can be calculated by considering the following Coulomb interaction matrix element between two holes, H 12 which takes the form Since the holes in the Coulomb band also oscil- lates in phase with the Wigner lattice at ω = ω G and 1/ǫ 1 ( q → 0, ω) ≈ 1 -ω 2 0 /( ω 2 G -ω 2 + ω 2 0 ) in the long wavelength limit with ω 2 0 ≡ 4πn W e 2 /m * , one immediately finds the range of ω where V = H 12 is attractive as ω G < ω < ω 2 0 + ω 2 G . Here we have ignored the contribution from the single particle excitation and the damping of ω G . No- tice that this interaction is not retarded. There- fore, the free carriers in the Coulomb band al- ready form pairs once the long range order of the Wigner lattice develops for temperatures be- low T ∼ ω 0 ∼ 215 K. Only when the pho- ton energy greater than ω 0 (or T > ∼ 215 K), these preformed pairs dissociates via the Coulomb repulsion. In fact, vortex-like excitations in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 systems at T as high as 150 K have been observed in the measurements of the Nernst effect. How does the superconducting order set in at T = T c ? There are evidences supporting that the phase stiffness of the superconducting order pa- rameter Ψ ∼ ∆e iφ plays a crucial role in high T c cuprates. Even though the pairing of the holes is achieved, the superconducting order will be ob- tained only after the long-range order in phase has been established. In conventional BCS su- perconductors, because of the phase stiffness en- ergy is much greater than the pair binding energy, the transition to the normal state is achieved by breaking the pair at T ≥ T c and the supercon- ducting transition and pairing take place at the same temperature.","0"

In the presence of the Coulomb interaction be- tween electrons, the dispersion relation for the collective excitations can be determined from the secular equation, 1 -V(q)X(q, ω) = 0 with bare Coulomb interaction V(q) = 4πe 2 /q 2 .

This mode shifts to the plasma frequency makes the observation of the phase collective mode impossible. However, for the case of the Wigner lattice ground state, we propose that one must consider the screened Coulomb interaction in the Wigner lattice ground state as instead. This modification leads to the phase col- lective mode solution ω φ 2 ≈ ω G 2 / (1 + γ) in q → 0 limit with γ ≡ n W m e / n F m * for the elec- trons pairs in the Wigner lattice with ǫ 1 (ω) ≈ 1 + 4πn W e 2 / m * (ω 2 G -ω 2 ).

At the same time, the strength increase in the Coulomb band suggests that more carri- ers occupy the Coulomb band following the de- velopment of the long-range order of the Wigner lattice. The corresponding free-carrier oscillator strength changes from ∼ 0.42 % at 300 K to ∼ 0.97 % at 150 K and to ∼ 1.18 % at 30 K in δ = 0.024 sample indicates that all the available free carriers are now occupying the Coulomb band and participating in the charge transport at T below 200 K. However, we do not observe the change in the free carrier plasma frequency because of the increasing static dielectric constant with de- creasing T. In δ = 0.032 sample, the free carrier strength is ∼ 0.44 % of the total carrier at 300 K and ∼ 0.71 % at 30 K. At the same time, as demonstrated above, at the crossover tempera- ture (T 0 ∼ 200 K) of the long-range order of the Wigner lattice, the free carriers in the Coulomb band start to form pairs. Subtle changes in the dρ/dT vs. T curves of both δ = 0.024 and δ = 0.032 samples at ∼ 200K has already been pointed out (see ). The resistivity de- creases faster and faster upon cooling below 200 K.

Although the relation between the stripe correla- tions and the mechanism of high-T c superconductivity is not fully understood yet, it has become clear 10,17 that the charge stripes determine the charge transport behav- ior, at least in the lightly hole doped region: charges can move more easily along the stripes than across the stripes. Given that the stripes indeed affect the ba- sic physical properties such as charge transport, it is de- sirable to build a comprehensive picture of the roles of stripes in the cuprates.

It is known that the antiferromagnetic (AF) insulating compound La 2 CuO 4 shows predominant phonon transport at low temperatures, which is mani- fested in a large phonon peak at 20 -25 K in the tem- perature dependence of both ab-plane and c-axis ther- mal conductivities (κ ab and κ c ); 18 such phonon peak dis- appears in Sr-doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) with x = 0.10 -0.20. The suppression of the phonon peak is normally caused by the defect scattering and the elec- tron scattering of phonons in doped single crystals; how- ever, it is also known that the phonon peak re-appears in both κ ab (T ) and κ c (T ) of overdoped La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 , 18 which cannot be explained in this scenario. Further- more, it was found that in rare earth (RE) and Sr co-doped La 2 CuO 4 , such as La 1.28 Nd 0.6 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 , the phonon thermal conductivity is much more enhanced in the non-superconducting LTT (low-temperature tetrag- onal) phase, compared to that in LSCO with the same Sr content. This cannot happen if the defect scattering and electron scattering of phonons are the only source of the peak suppression. Based on the fact that in RE-and Sr-doped La 2 CuO 4 systems the phononic thermal con- ductivity is always strongly suppressed in superconduct- ing samples, it was proposed that dynamical stripes cause a pronounced damping of phonon heat transport, while static stripes do not suppress the phonon trans- port so significantly. It is indeed possible that the static stripes are not effective in scattering phonons, if they only induce periodic local distortions in the crystal structure. Since the spin stripes in lightly doped LSCO (x = 0.01 -0.05) are reported to be static, one may naively expect that the phonon heat transport is not strongly suppressed in such lightly doped LSCO. However, there has been no measurement of the thermal conductivity of lightly doped LSCO single crystals.","0"

For undoped La 2 CuO 4 sam- ple, a sharp peak appears at low temperature, at ∼25 K in κ ab (T ) and at ∼20 K in κ c (T ), respectively. In the c direction, above the peak temperature, κ c de- creases with increasing T approximately following 1/T dependence, which is typical for phonon heat transport. This phonon peak originates from the competition be- tween the increase in the population of phonons and the decrease in their mean free path (due to the phonon- phonon umklapp scattering) with increasing tempera- ture. In contrast to the mainly phononic heat trans- port in the c direction, in the ab plane another large and broad peak develops at higher temperature (∼270 K), which has been attributed 18 to the magnon trans- port in a long-range-ordered AF state. The heat con- duction due to magnetic excitations has been observed in many low-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets, such as one-dimensional spin systems CuGeO 3 , 21,23,25 Sr 2 CuO 3 , 26 SrCuO 2 , 27 and (Sr,Ca) 14 Cu 24 O 41 , and also two-dimensional antiferromagnet K 2 V 3 O 8 . The ab- sence of this high-T peak in κ c (T ) is obviously due to the much weaker magnetic correlations in the c direction compared to that in the CuO 2 plane. All these behav- iors in undoped La 2 CuO 4 are consistent with the previ- ously reported data. It is worthwhile to note that the phononic peak value of κ c (27 W/Km) is considerably larger than that of κ ab (16 W/Km). One possible reason for this difference is that the phonon heat transport is intrinsically easier along the c axis, which is not so easy to conceive in view of the layered crystal structure of La 2 CuO 4 . Another, more likely possibility is that there exists phonon-magnon scattering in the ab plane that causes additional damping of the phonon peak.

First, it is important to notice that the low-T phonon peak in κ ab is suppressed slightly more quickly by Zn doping than by Sr doping. In the impurity-scattering scenario, it is difficult to con- ceive that the phonons are scattered more strongly in LCZO than in LSCO, because the atomic mass differ- ence between Cu and Zn is much smaller than that be- tween La and Sr. In addition, the contribution of the phonon-carrier scattering, which exists only in LSCO, would cause the phonon peak in LSCO to be suppressed more quickly than in LCZO. Thus, the difference between the Sr-doping dependence and the Zn-doping dependence in κ ab (T ) at low temperature, which is opposite to the naturally expected trend, suggests that there are addi- tional scatterers of phonons in the Zn doped samples. It is most likely that the additional scatterers in LCZO are of magnetic origin; magnons, which cause the high- temperature peak in LCZO, are an obvious candidate, and the magnetic disordering around Zn atoms may also cause some scattering of phonons through magnetoelastic coupling. It is useful to note that, as we mentioned in section III A, magnons are likely to be already responsi- ble for the relatively small phonon peak in κ ab (compared to that in κ c ) in pure La 2 CuO 4.","0"

Apart from the impurity scattering, two different scat- tering processes of phonons are possibly responsible for the suppression of the c-axis phonon heat transport. The first possibility is the magnon-phonon scattering. This may partly play a role (particularly in samples where the long-range Néel order is established) in the c-axis phonon heat transport, although their role is expected to be mi- nor because of the essentially two-dimensional nature of the magnons in the LCO system, which means that the magnons cannot effectively change the wave vector of the c-axis phonons. The second possibility is the scattering of phonons caused by the static stripes that exist only in LSCO. In the following, we elaborate on this possibility.","0"
"2619","P067104503-CC","16","It is known that static spin stripes are formed at low temperatures in lightly doped LSCO. If the charges also form static stripes together with the spins, they cer- tainly cause local lattice distortions. Even if the charges do not conform to the static stripe potentials set by the spins, the spin stripes themselves may well cause local lattice distortions due to the magnetoelastic coupling; 33 this direct coupling between the spin stripes and the local lattice distortions is in fact very likely, because recently Lavrov et al. found that the spin-lattice coupling is very strong in lightly doped LSCO. It should be noted that the local lattice distortions due to static stripes are not expected to scatter phonons when the stripes induce only static and periodic modulation of the lattice (which is in fact a kind of superlattice); however, possible disordering of stripes in the c direction can introduce rather strong scattering of phonons in this direction. In fact, because of the weak magnetic correlations along the c axis, the stripes in neighboring CuO 2 planes are only weakly cor- related or even uncorrelated, which is best evidenced by the very short magnetic correlation length ξ c in the stripe phase (usually smaller than the distance between neigh- boring CuO 2 planes) in the lightly doped LSCO. We can further discuss the possible role of static stripes in the suppression of the phonon peak in κ ab of lightly doped LSCO. Although the stripes are much better or- dered in the ab plane than in the c direction, 6,7 there are two reasons that phonons in the ab plane are possi- bly scattered by the stripes. First, the static spin stripes were reported to be established at about 30 K to 17 K for x = 0.01 to 0.04 by the neutron measurements. These temperatures are very close to the position of the phonon peak . Near the stripe freezing tem- perature, local lattice distortions are expected to be well developed and yet are slowly fluctuating (or disordered), which would tend to scatter phonons. Second, there is no evidence until today that well periodically-ordered static charge stripes are formed in lightly doped LSCO; instead, our charge transport data strongly suggest that the charge stripes exist in a liquid (or nematic) state. 14 Such disordered state of charge stripes would tend to scatter phonons. Thus, it is possible that the static stripes also contribute to the scattering of phonons in the in-plane heat transport in LSCO, although their effect appears to be much weaker than that in the c direction.","0"
"2620","P067104503-CC","17","We have measured the ab-plane and the c-axis thermal conductivities of lightly doped LSCO and LCZO single crystals. It is found that the low-temperature phonon peak is significantly suppressed upon Sr or Zn doping even at very low doping levels, and that the doping de- pendence show clear differences between the Sr and Zn dopants, and between κ ab and κ c . The experimental ob- servations can be summarized as follows:  (i) The phonon peak in κ c decreases much more quickly with Sr doping than with Zn doping. (ii) On the other hand, the phonon peak in κ ab is suppressed slightly more quickly with Zn doping than with Sr doping. (iii) At high temperature, the magnon peak in κ ab (T ) decreases much more quickly with Sr doping than with Zn doping; in fact, the magnon peak completely disappears in LSCO with x = 0.01, while it is still observable in LCZO with y = 0.04. (iv) Rare- earth (Nd or Eu) doping for LSCO (x = 0.12) enhances the phonon heat transport in both κ ab and κ c , and this is manifested in the re-appearance of the low temper- ature phonon peak, whose height is similar to that of rare-earth-free LSCO with x = 0.04.","0"
"2621","P067104503-CC","18","Based on the peculiar doping dependences of the low- temperature phonon peak, we can deduce the following conclusions for the phonon heat transport at low tem- peratures: (i) In the in-plane direction, disordered static stripes are probably working as scatterers of phonon (in addition to the Sr impurities and the holes) in LSCO, while in LCZO magnetic scatterings cause strong damp- ing of the phonon transport, which overcompensates the absence of the stripe scattering. (ii) In the c-axis heat transport, besides the possible contribution of the magnon-phonon scattering, strong disorder of the stripe arrangement along the c-axis is mainly responsible for the scattering of phonons. The latter scattering mechanism naturally explains the strong damping of the phonon peak in LSCO, while allowing much slower suppression of the phonon peak in LCZO where there is no stripe. Therefore, the effect of static spin stripes, which are formed in the lightly doped LSCO, appears to be most dramatically observed in the c-axis phonon heat trans- port.","0"

"2624","P064144524-CC","2","Since the discovery of the anomalous suppression of superconductivity in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8, the so-called 1/8 anomaly has been a subject of con- siderable research attention. In recent years, the 1/8 anomaly has been found not only in a series of La-214 high-T c superconductors but also in the Bi-2212 and Y-123 ones, which means that the 1/8 anomaly is common to high-T c superconductors in- cluding the CuO 2 plane in their crystal structures. In La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8, the structural phase tran- sition from the orthorhombic mid-temperature (OMT, space group: Bmab) to tetragonal low-temperature (TLT, space group: P4 2 /ncm) phase occurs at ∼ 70 K. Moreover, at low temperatures below the struc- tural phase transition temperature, T d2 , the transport properties exhibit various anomalous behaviors, such as an increase in the electrical resistivity and decreases in the thermoelectric power and the Hall coefficient with decreasing temperature. Therefore, the intimate con- nection between the crystal structure, the electronic state and the suppression of superconductivity has at- tracted notice. Several years ago, a static stripe order of holes and spins in the CuO 2 plane was discov- ered from the elastic neutron-scattering experiment in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 with x = 0.12. The static stripe order is formed as the TLT phase appears. There- fore, they have proposed that the dynamical stripe cor- relations, observed in a wide range of hole concentration in the La-214 superconductors, are pinned by the TLT structure, leading to the appearance of the static stripe order and the suppression of superconductivity.","0"
"2625","P064144524-CC","3","In La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8, such a static stripe order has not yet been found in the neutron scattering experiment because of the difficulty in the preparation of a large-sized single crystal of good quality. However, it is thought that the static stripe order exists also in this system, taking account of the appearance of the TLT phase and transport anomalies below T d2 in the polycrystalline sample which are analogous to those ob- served in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 . Moreover, the observation of a magnetic order of Cu spins in the muon- spin-rotation (µSR) measurements provides a strong cir- cumstantial evidence in favor of spin stripe ordering in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8. Another inter- est in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 is that the effect of the Nd spin in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 on the formation of the static stripe order can be examined. It is because Sakita et al. have pointed out that the behavior of the susceptibility of La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 is quite different from that of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 even above T d2 , which suggests that the Nd moment may have a great influence on the formation of the static stripe order. Accordingly, the prepara- tion of the high-quality single crystals of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8 and the detailed study on the possible stripe order are of much importance. Several attempts to grow single crystals of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 by the traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) method have been reported so far. However, no single crystal of good quality with x ∼ 1/8 has been grown in flowing O 2 -gas of low pressures below ∼ 2 bars.

As for the sign reversal of R H , it is often observed in the superconducting fluctuation regime, though it has not yet been understood clearly. It is an empirical fact that the sign reversal of R H has a strong magnetic-field depen- dence in the superconducting fluctuation regime. That is, the magnitude of the sign reversal of R H decreases with increasing magnetic field, accompanied by the broaden- ing of the superconducting transition curve in resistivity. displays the temperature dependence of R H in various magnetic fields, measured using another batch of the single-crystal La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 0.11.

Therefore, it is dif- ficult that the observed reversal in the sign of R H in the single-crystal La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 0.11 is attributed to the superconducting fluctuation.

The extremely strong suppression of su- perconductivity on non-magnetic impurities 3,4 gave first hints on unconventional superconductivity. That triplet pairing might be favored in Sr 2 RuO 4 was pointed out in early discussions . And indeed, at present there exists sound experimental evidence that the supercon- ducting order parameter is of p-wave symmetry: NMR Knight shift 8 , muon spin rotation 9 and small angle scat- tering from the flux lattice 10 support the idea that the su- perconducting state breaks time-reversal symmetry, not compatible with either s-wave or d-wave states. Fur- thermore, power-law dependencies of the heat capacity, C ∝ T 2 (Ref. , and of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, 1/T 1 ∝ T 3 (Ref. , are fingerprints of unconven- tional superconductivity.","1"

However, quite astonishingly there is not much experimental ev- idence for ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the pure compound.

In addition, strongly anisotropic spin fluctuations have been observed in O-NMR experiments with significant AFM char- acter. However, similar NMR results by Imai et al. were interpreted to result from orbital dependent ferro- magnetic correlations. The fact that the presence of FM and AFM spin fluctuations yields a strong competition between d-and p-wave superconductivity 20 or that spin- triplet superconductivity may even arise from AFM spin fluctuations , has been pointed out theoretically.

On decreasing temperature ρ ab decreases, passes through a minimum and exhibits a semiconducting characteristic for T < 40 K. This minimum could signal the onset of localization of charge carriers within ab-plane, Kondo- type scattering of charge carriers on localized moments or a partial gapping of the Fermi surface due to the for- mation of a spin-density wave. We will see later that at 5 K the optical conductivity reveals a metallic Drude- type of behavior. In addition we carefully analyzed the resistivity upturn for x = 0.2 and T < 50 K in terms of a Kondo-like increase or hopping conductivity of localized charge carriers. Both models do not provide a reason- able description of the low-temperature upturn.

It is worth to mention that the data can be well fitted in the complete range up to room temperature employing this additional linear term χ cor T without hav- ing significant influence on the results for the parameters χ Pauli , µ ef f , and Θ.

T m is in agreement with the phase diagram published by Minakata and Maeno 26 , which shows a saturation of T m for Ti concentration x > 0.12. The fact that for x = 0.1 and 0.2 the char- acteristic temperatures T m are almost the same could in- dicate slight deviations of the effective Ti concentration from the nominal composition. One is tempted to assume spin-glass like ordering of statistically substituted local 3d 1 states embedded in a Fermi-liquid of the band states. However, the FC and ZFC cycles were performed at relatively high fields of 10 kOe. At such high fields spin-glass effects often are suppressed . The FC and ZFC splitting can also in- dicate the formation of FM clusters or even true long- range ferromagnetism were the FC and ZFC splitting result from domain-wall effects in strongly anisotropic materials. Having the time dependence of magnetiza- tion in mind, which has been observed by Minakata and Maeno , it seems most plausible to assume short-range FM correlations only. We also would like to stress that magnetization for fields within the ab-plane is not af- fected at all and for low temperatures the zero-field curve with H c is well below M with H a, b.

The resis- tivity along c reveals a semiconducting behavior down to the lowest temperatures and the resistivity within the RuO 2 -planes signals the onset of localization effects close to 50 K. From the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization we conclude that the crystals exhibit an anisotropic Curie-Weiss behavior at temperatures be- low 100 K. Moreover magnetic ordering along c with a moment of order 0.01 µ B /f.u. evolves at T < 15 K. At the moment it is unclear if long-range or short- range magnetism is established below T m . However it is clear that strong AFM exchange dominates the in-plane properties while FM coupling between the planes estab-lishes FM correlations along c. Antiferromagnetic or-der within the planes corresponds to spin arrangements observed in La 2 CuO 4 and La 2 NiO 4 and also were de- tected in Ca 2 RuO 4 (Ref. . We also speculate that even at elevated temperatures the Ti-doped Ruthenates behave like two-dimensional magnets similar to what has been observed in Sr-doped La 2 CuO 4 (Ref. ). High- temperature susceptibility measurements, even in the pure compound are highly warranted. From the heat capacity experiments we find that the Sommerfeld co- efficient significantly becomes suppressed on Ti-doping reaching values of 27 mJ mol −1 K −2 for x = 0.1 and 23 mJ mol −1 K −2 for x = 0.2, which still are extremely high values for a bad metal close to localization with a low density of charge carriers. Carrying out the heat ca- pacity in a broader temperature range, we find that just below the magnetic ordering transition the susceptibility becomes considerably enhanced and at low temperatures possibly soft magnetic excitations dominate the heat ca- pacity. However, at the magnetic ordering temperature, as observed in the susceptibility experiments, no heat ca- pacity anomalies indicative for long-range magnetic order were detected. This can be interpreted as an additional evidence that only short-range order exists below T m .

"2679","P068214517-CC","1","Neutron and x-ray powder diffraction have been used to investigate the crystal structures of a sample of the newly-discovered superconducting sodium cobaltate deuterate compound with composition Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 •1.25(2)D 2 O and its anhydrous parent compound Na 0.61(1) CoO 2 . The anhydrous parent compound Na 0.61(1) CoO 2 has two partially occupied Na sites sandwiched, in the same plane, between CoO 2 layers. When Na is removed to make the superconducting composition, the Na site that experiences the strongest Na-Co repulsion is emptied while the occupancy of the other Na site is reduced to about one third. The deuterate superconducting compound is formed by coordinating four D 2 O molecules (two above and two below) to each remaining Na ion in a way that gives Na-O distances nearly equal to those in the parent compound. One deuteron of the D 2 O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO 2 plane and the oxygen atom and the second deuteron of each D 2 O molecule lie approximately in a plane between the Na layer and the CoO 2 layers. This coordination of Na by four D 2 O molecules leads in a straightforward way to ordering of the Na ions and D 2 O molecules consistent with the observation of additional shorter-range scattering features in the diffraction data. The sample studied here, which has T c =4.5 K, has a refined composition of Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 •1.25(2)D 2 O, in agreement with the expected 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O. These results show that the optimal superconducting composition should be viewed as a specific hydrated compound, not a solid solution of Na and D 2 O (H 2 O) in Na x CoO 2 •yD 2 O. The hydrated superconducting compound may be stable over a limited range of Na and D 2 O concentration, but studies of T c and other physical properties vs. Na or D 2 O composition should be viewed with caution until it is verified that the compound remains in the same phase over the composition range of the study.","1"
"2680","P068214517-CC","2","The recent discovery of superconductivity at 4.5 K in hydrated sodium cobaltate with a reported composition of Na 0.3 CoO 2 •1.4H 2 O [1] has generated renewed interest in the compositional chemistry and crystal structure of these materials. In recent years, the related anhydrous compound, Na x CoO 2 , has been studied because of its interesting transport properties. Wang et al. have argued that spin entropy arising from the two-dimensional triangular Co lattice is the explanation for the enhanced thermopower. More recently, the same authors have reported an anomalous Hall effect for Na x CoO 2 . They observe that Na x CoO 2 exhibits ""strange metal physics as observed in the cuprates."" Na x CoO 2 is made superconducting by removing part of the Na, which changes the oxidation state of Co, and intercalating water to dramatically increase the separation between the CoO 2 layers. Bulk superconductivity with T c >2 K has been reported to exist over a very narrow range of Na compositions, approximately 1/4≤x≤1/3, in the hydrated compound Na x CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O with the maximum T c (4.5 K) at x≈0.3. This dome-like behavior of T c is reminiscent of the layered cuprates, suggesting that this new layered compound may be the first non-copper example of the same physics. The importance of the two- dimensional nature of the structure is emphasized by the fact that a lower hydrate, Na 0.3 CoO 2 •0.6H 2 O, with the same Co formal oxidation state but substantially less separation between the CoO 2 layers is not superconducting. Prior to the recent interest in transport properties and superconductivity, compounds of this family were studied because of their fast-ion conducting properties. The Na ions are in two partially occupied crystallographic sites, both of which lie in a plane between layers of edge- sharing CoO 6 octahedra. The ability to change the Na (or other cation) content and to intercalate water has been investigated for isostructural compounds such as Na 2/3 (Co x Ni 1/3-x Mn 2/3 )O 2 ,and Li 0.12 K 0.35 MnO 2.14 •0.45H 2 O. However, the structural details of the water intercalation and, in particular, the crystal structure of the Na x CoO 2 •yH 2 O, have never been reported. Clearly, an understanding of the crystal structure is fundamental to interpreting the physical behavior.","1"
"2681","P068214517-CC","3","In this paper, we report the crystal structures of the starting anhydrous compound, Na 0.61 CoO 2 and the deuterated superconducting composition, Na 0.31 CoO 2 •1.25D 2 O. We show that, when the Na concentration is reduced, Na is selectively removed from one of the two inequivalent Na sites. Then, after D 2 O is incorporated, the D 2 O molecules occupy sites between the CoO 2 layers and the Na ions in such a way that the coordination of Na to the oxygen ions of the D 2 O molecules is similar to its previous coordination to oxygen ions in the CoO 2 layers in Na 0.61 CoO 2, except that the Na to D 2 O ratio is four, resulting in two D 2 O molecules above the Na ion and two below. One deuteron of each D 2 O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO 2 layer. The constraint of minimizing Na-D and D-D repulsions leads in a straightforward way to two-dimensional ordering of Na ions and D 2 O molecules. In the supercell structure, the second deuteron of each D 2 O molecule is hydrogen bonded to the oxygen atom of a neighboring D 2 O molecule to form hydrogen bonded zigzag D-O•D-O•D-O. chains. The diffraction data are consistent with this ordering in the plane and also show that ordering along the c axis, with a shorter length scale, is present. A possible explanation is that both Na ions and D 2 O molecules are ordered in the plane, but D 2 O ordering has a much shorter coherence length than Na ordering along the c axis. The refined composition of the sample studied here, Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 •1.25(2)D 2 O manifests the ideal 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O. The findings reported here shed important new light on studies of T c vs. composition which show a dome- like behavior of T c and a recent theory [10] that predicts that the highest T c is achieved at a composition between two ordered structures, where Co charge ordering is disrupted. This work shows that the maximum T c is achieved in an ordered structure, but with a composition slightly off the ideal ordering composition of Na 1/3 .","0"
"2682","P068214517-CC","4","A powder sample of the anhydrous compound with composition Na 0.61(1) CoO 2 was made by repeated heating and grinding of a mixture of Na 2 CO 3 and Co 3 O 4 in air at 850° C. An initial powder stoichiometry of Na 0.7 CoO 2 resulted in a sample of composition Na 0.61(1) CoO 2 due to a slight loss of Na during the heating cycles. (All compositions stated in the paper are those determined by Rietveld refinement using neutron powder diffraction data.)  The chemical oxidative deintercalation of Na from this material is generally done using Br 2 or I 2 in acetonitrile. For the neutron diffraction experiments, a fully deuterated sample was desired in order to avoid the large neutron incoherent scattering from hydrogen, which adds background to the diffraction data. In order to eliminate any possible hydrogen incorporation during the oxidative deintercalation, either from the acetonitrile or residual H 2 O in the acetonitrile, we used Br 2 in D 2 O as the oxidizing medium. About 10 wt% of Na 0.61 CoO 2 powder in D 2 O with a 100 to 200% excess of Br 2 was shaken overnight in an air-tight pyrex tube. The resulting powder was then separated by either filtration or centrifuging from the Br 2 solution with as little exposure to the atmosphere as possible. After washing with D 2 O to remove excess Br 2 and NaBr the resulting material was kept in a container with 100% relative humidity of D 2 O. This ""as-oxidized"" deuterated material contained free D 2 O, as evidenced by the appearance of peaks from ice in a neutron powder diffraction pattern taken at low temperature. In order to remove only the free D 2 O and none of the lattice D 2 O, knowledge of the vapor pressure of D 2 O in equilibrium with the higher deuterate phase is required. Approximately 2g of the material was placed in a vacuum system and pumped to remove air. The D 2 O pressure over the hydrate was measured using a capacitance manometer as the D 2 O was volumetrically removed by cooling a calibrated glass bulb attached to the vacuum system to liquid nitrogen temperature. To allow the sample to come to equilibrium at each partial pressure of D 2 O, this cryopumping was done in small steps -typically a few minutes of pumping followed by equilibration times of up to several hours. All measurements were done at 23.0 ± 0.2° C. Fig . shows the D 2 O pressure as a function of removed D 2 O. The long plateau at 2.3-2.4 kPa pressure indicates that the sample is a mixture of free D 2 O and the higher deuterate phase (plus, perhaps, some D 2 O adsorbed on the walls of the vacuum system). In this particular experiment, ~1.6 cc of free D 2 O was removed before reaching the point where little additional free D 2 O remained and the D 2 O pressure dropped sharply with further pumping. The plateau at about 1 kPa indicates the transition to a two-phase deuterate mixture; i.e., a mixture of the higher deuterate phase and the lower deuterate phase reported to have the composition Na 0.3 CoO 2 •0.6D 2 O. A single phase of the higher deuterate with a minimum amount of free D 2 O can be made by equilibrating at a D 2 O pressure just above 1 kPa. The sample used for the diffraction measurements was equilibrated at 1.2 kPa D 2 O pressure overnight.","0"

Once the sample is sealed in the can with helium, there is not enough free volume to allow a significant change in the D 2 O content of the sample. The diffraction pattern showed only the higher deuterate phase; none of the lower deuterate phase [6] (which is easily identified by its shorter c axis) was present, indicating no loss of D 2 O during sample loading. Additionally, no D 2 O ice peaks were seen at low temperature, indicating that no free D 2 O existed in this sample. To minimize handling of the sample, AC susceptibility measurements were not done until after the neutron diffraction measurements (described below). The AC susceptibility data are shown in Fig . . A superconducting transition with an onset at 4.5 K is seen. This equals the highest onset temperature seen in this material, confirming that the sample is at an optimal superconducting composition. The width of the transition is similar to that seen for optimally- doped samples in other studies,confirming the quality of the sample. This post-diffraction measurement of T c confirms that the sample remained at the superconducting composition during the neutron diffraction measurements.","1"

"2687","P068214517-CC","9","The refined structural parameters and selected bond lengths at various temperatures for Na 0.61 CoO 2 are given in Table . The structure is shown in Fig . . The CoO 2 layers are formed from edge-sharing CoO 6 octahedra, where the Co-O bond length is 1.908 Å (at room temperature). The oxygen atoms lie in two planes, above and below the plane of Co atoms. Na ions lie in two partially occupied sites in a plane halfway between the CoO 2 layers. The two Na sites differ in their coordination to the oxygen atoms in the CoO 2 layers, as shown in Fig . . The Na1 site is coordinated to six oxygen atoms that are bonded to six different Co atoms (three above and three below). The Na2 site is also coordinated to six oxygen atoms (three above and three below), but the sets of three oxygen atoms (above and below Na) are bonded to the same Co atoms. The average Na-O bond lengths are identical (by symmetry) for the two Na sites (2.379 Å at 12 K). It has previously been proposed [14] that slightly weaker bonding of the Na2 site results from Na-Co Coulomb repulsion, which is greater for this site when both first-and second-nearest neighbor Na-Co repulsions are considered. This leads to a smaller occupancy for the Na2 site compared to the Na1 site. The Na ions show displacements from their ideal sites at both room temperature and low temperature. This probably results from repulsion of randomly- located neighboring Na ions, locally violating the hexagonal symmetry. In Rietveld refinement, such displacements can be modeled with anisotropic temperature factors or by assigning the Na ions to displaced, partially occupied sites. The latter model has been used for the Na1 site in the refinements reported in Table . For the Na2 site, the displacement was not large enough to statistically justify a displaced-site model. Because this detail of the structural model does not give any additional insight into the compound, all figures show only the average, high-symmetry, Na sites and average Na-O bond lengths (i.e., bond lengths to the ideal, high-symmetry site). The tables, however, list the Na1-O bond lengths resulting from the use of a displaced-site model for Na1.","0"
"2688","P068214517-CC","10","Rietveld refinement of the Na 0.31 CoO 2 •1.25D 2 O structure was approached by first using the same model as for the anhydrous compound, with different lattice parameters, and not including any D 2 O in the model. These refinements immediately showed that when Na is removed, it comes selectively from the more weakly bonded Na2 site, leaving that site empty within the accuracy of the refinement. In the final refinements, the occupancy of the Na2 site tended to go slightly negative (~ one esd) so it was set to zero. To achieve the x≈0.3 composition, part of the Na is also removed from the Na1 site (which was initially only partially occupied). In the deuterate compound, the displacement of the Na1 ion off its ideal site is even larger than for the anhydrous compound. Thus, in the refinement model, Na1 has been assigned to a partially occupied [6h(2x,x,1/4)] displaced site.","0"
"2689","P068214517-CC","11","To locate the D 2 O molecules, Fourier difference maps were plotted. These maps showed scattering density suggesting that the oxygen atoms of the D 2 O molecules were located in layers between the CoO 2 layers and Na layers. Additionally, the maps showed two possible deuterium sites: one approximately in the same plane as the oxygen atoms and one closer to the CoO 2 layers. Fourier maps from room-temperature and low-temperature data were not dramatically different. Rietveld refinements were then attempted by adding D 2 O molecules in general positions [24l(x,y,z)] with rigid-body constraints being used to maintain the expected molecule geometry; i.e., a D-O distance of 0.99Å and a D-O-D angle of 109°. This constraint is thought to be justified based on the configurations seen for water molecules in a wide range of hydrated compounds and ices. In this model, the refinement gives the best-fit position for the oxygen atom of the D 2 O molecule and the orientation of the molecule. The resulting refined structural parameters and selected bond lengths for the deuterate superconducting compound are given in Table . This refinement model gives a composition of Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 •1.25(2)D 2 O (based on the 12 K data where correlations between temperature factors and site occupancies are the smallest). The refined 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O (within one esd) suggests that the synthesis method used here, including the careful adjustment of the D 2 O content to the conditions for the most stable phase, has produced a compound with four D 2 O molecules coordinated to each Na ion. While sixfold coordination is common for Na ions, fourfold coordination is observed in many oxides and hydrated compounds, including Na 2 O. The refined average Na-O distance (2.31 Å) is also consistent with that expected for a four-coordinated Na hydrate and is remarkably similar to the Na-O distance for Na ions in water (2.4 Å), where the average coordination is 4.9.(Note that when static displacement of the Na ions is considered, the resulting inequivalent Na-O distances vary from 2.18 to 2.42 Å.) The refined composition also falls within the range of values reported for the composition of the optimized superconducting compound.","0"
"2690","P068214517-CC","12","Refinement of this structural model in the fundamental hexagonal unit cell leads to partially- occupied symmetry-equivalent sites for D 2 O that cannot be simultaneously occupied in the actual structure because of impossibly close O-O distances, incorrect orientations of D 2 O with respect to Na (i.e., orientations in which D, rather than O, is oriented toward the Na ion), and energetically unfavorable D-D repulsions. A plausible picture for the actual structure can be readily constructed by considering logical rules for chemical bonding and coordination. All symmetry-equivalent D 2 O molecules have the same coordination to oxygen atoms in the CoO 2 plane. Hence, the actual structure can most easily be visualized by considering only one layer of D 2 O molecules and the associated Na ions. Fig . shows all symmetry-equivalent Na and D 2 O sites in one of these layers. If all such sites were occupied (including the D 2 O layers above and below Na), the composition would be NaCoO 2 •12D 2 O. However, it is straightforward to see that all of these sites cannot be simultaneously occupied. Three bonding/coordination rules can be applied to construct plausible structures from Fig . . First, to minimize D-Na repulsion, D 2 O molecules strongly prefer to be oriented with the deuteron ""pointing"" away from, not toward, an occupied Na site. Second, impossibly close oxygen-oxygen distances cannot occur. Third, each Na ion should be coordinated by four D 2 O molecules (two above and two below) in agreement with the refined composition and consistent with known Na oxide and hydrate compounds. The application of these rules leads in a straightforward way to the ordered structure shown in Fig . . (The interested reader can sequentially mark Na and D 2 O sites in Fig . following the three rules above and see how this solution is obtained.)  Both the Na ions and the D 2 O molecules are ordered into a two-dimensional supercell.

Note that there are three equivalent choices for the orientation of D 2 O molecules around each Na ion, leading to three equivalent directions for these chains. One would not expect the orthorhombic supercell to have lattice parameters that so accurately match the fundamental hexagonal cell unless the three equivalent choices for forming ordered layers occur with equal populations. Thus, if there is ordering (i.e., translational symmetry of a particular stacking sequence) along the c axis, the c axis must also be tripled. Hence, the smallest supercell that can manifest the Na and D 2 O ordering while preserving the hexagonal symmetry of the fundamental cell is orthorhombic with dimensions 3a x √3a x 3c.","0"
"2692","P068214517-CC","14","This orthorhombic 3a x √3a x 3c supercell can describe all of the major features of the scattering from shorter-range ordering seen in neutron and x-ray powder diffraction data, as shown in Fig. . The broad scattering feature extending from ~2.8 to 2.5 Å in the neutron diffraction data can be explained equivalently as a (30l) rod of scattering with its intensity strongly modulated along l or as scattering from a series of (30l) peaks [i.e., (300), (301), (302), (303), etc.] whose peak broadening increases with l, causing them to overlap . Maxima in the intensity are observed around the (303) and (309) peaks. The scattering from this 30l zone is characteristic of short-range ordering in which the coherence length along the c axis is shorter than in the basal plane. Since this scattering feature is observed much more strongly in neutron diffraction than in x-ray diffraction, one might conclude that it comes from short-range ordering of D 2 O molecules (because D has a comparatively large scattering cross section for neutrons). In the x-ray diffraction data, the (30.12) peak in this series, seen at 2.45 Å, is stronger than for neutron diffraction and is resolved from the nearby peaks from the fundamental hexagonal cell by the high resolution . The width of this supercell peak defines a coherence length of about 500 Å, which is longer than the out-of-plane coherence length implied by the neutron diffraction data for the (30l) series . Thus, taken together, the neutron and x-ray diffraction data suggest that there may be two different length scales for supercell ordering along the c axis. A possible explanation is that Na site occupancies and/or displacements (and perhaps corresponding distortions of the CoO 2 layers) are ordered over a ~500 Å length scale while D 2 O orientations are ordered over a shorter length scale. The supercell peak at 1.629 Å, which is very strong in neutron diffraction and is also seen in x-ray diffraction, can be indexed as a (030) peak . The width of this peak defines an in-plane coherence length of about 1000 Å, which is assumed to apply to both Na and D 2 O in-plane ordering. The supercell peak at ~1.41 Å (seen in the difference plot in can be indexed as the (060)/(330) peak and may have additional scattering from (06l)/(33l) peaks extending to smaller d spacings as for the (30l) series. Many other weaker features can also be indexed in the same supercell, but, because the supercell is so large, the assignments are not unique. A full interpretation of the scattering from ordering on shorter length scales will certainly come in the future from studies of single crystals, which are now reported to have been grown. For that reason, and given the complexity resulting from the very large supercell involved, a more complete analysis of the scattering from shorter- range ordering has not been pursued using the present data.","0"

"2695","P068214517-CC","17","The results presented here show that the highest onset T c (=4.5 K) reported in Na x CoO 2 •yD 2 O is achieved in an ordered deuterate structure in which each Na ion is coordinated to four D 2 O molecules and both Na ions and D 2 O molecules are ordered into a superlattice. This ordered structure has the ideal composition Na x CoO 2 •4xD 2 O with x=1/3 when all Na and D 2 O sites are occupied. The refined composition, Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 •1.25(2)D 2 O, suggests that the maximum T c is achieved at a composition slightly off the ideal composition, in agreement with other reports for the composition at maximum T c . In the sample studied here, which was made in a way that places the composition at a plateau in partial pressure of D 2 O in equilibrium with the sample, the ideal 1:4 Na to D 2 O ratio is maintained, even though the sample is slightly deficient in both Na and D 2 O compared to the ideal model. Other reports indicate that a higher water content can be achieved for an Na content of x≈0.3. It is perhaps possible that additional water could be accommodated using the space made available by Na vacancies for the x≈0.3 composition (see Fig . ) . One can visualize a hydrogen-bonded network of D 2 O molecules occupying the available space in a way consistent with the pattern of symmetry equivalent positions shown in Fig . . Alternatively, additional D 2 O could perhaps be accommodated in the Na plane, as in the structure of the lower deuterate phase, Na 0.3 CoO 2 •0.6D 2 O. Thus, reports of water contents higher than 4/3 are not necessarily inconsistent with the model presented here, especially in the case where the Na content is below 1/3. However, the incorporation of two water molecules per formula unit, as reported by Jin et al. seems unlikely in light of the structure. Perhaps reports of water concentrations higher than 4/3 should be viewed with suspicion until it is shown that all of the water is actually in the lattice. Surface adsorbed water could easily cause errors in bulk measurements of water content. The data presented here for the partial pressure of D 2 O in equilibrium with the hydrated material (Fig . ) argue that the water content does not depart far from the ideal 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O molecules. Even if extra water can be accommodated in the space made available by Na vacancies, as the ideal Na content of 1/3 is approached the ability to accommodate extra water would be expected to decrease, Additionally, for Na contents greater than 1/3, the compound must either generate ""Na interstitial"" defects in the Na ordering, where the extra Na ions could not achieve the fourfold coordination to D 2 O molecules, or phase separate. The data of Schaak et al. for T c vs. Na concentration are consistent with phase separation for Na contents above x=1/3. T c remains constant at ~2 K, while the superconducting fraction decreases, for increasing Na contents above 1/3.","1"
"2696","P068214517-CC","18","It is important to speculate about what happens for Na concentrations below x≈0.3. Baskaran has presented a theory based on the idea that the highest T c in this system occurs between the compositions Na 1/3 and Na 1/4 that would be expected to give ordered phases. One hypothesis of his theory is that ordering of Na ions would promote charge ordering of the Co atoms, which, in turn, would suppress superconductivity. Thus, the ordered phases at the ideal compositions x=1/3 and 1/4 would be unfavorable for superconductivity. In agreement with these ideas, the maximum T c is achieved at a Na concentration below x=1/3. However, the present results show that the optimal superconducting composition displays ordering, over an in-plane coherence length of ~1000 Å, the same as for the ideal x=1/3 composition. The increase of T c upon decreasing the Na content from x=1/3 could simply be a doping effect, as proposed by Schaak et al. To better understand this behavior, it is important to understand what happens when the Na concentration is further reduced toward the composition x=1/4, which corresponds to a different ordered structure in Baskaran's model. Fig . shows a possible ordered structure with this Na concentration. At this Na concentration, each Na ion can achieve sixfold coordination to D 2 O molecules. This is also the most common coordination for Na oxide and hydrate structures. The present data give no evidence for the occurrence of this ordered compound. However, if it does form at the Na composition x=1/4, the data of Schaak et al. for T c vs. composition may have a different interpretation. The drop in T c from 4.5 K to 2 K upon decreasing the Na concentration from 0.30 to 0.26 may result from a transition from the Na 1/3 to the Na 1/4 phase. If this is the case, the conclusion that the dome-like behavior of T c mimics the behavior seen in the layered cuprates [5] may be premature. Clearly, a careful structural study of a composition near x=1/4 must be pursued.","1"
"2697","P068214517-CC","19","In conclusion, we have shown that the highest reported T c (=4.5 K) in the Na x CoO 2 •yD 2 O system is achieved in a hydrate phase with well-defined composition and ordering of both Na ions and D 2 O molecules. The deuteration of Na leads to the formation of 2D 2 O-Na-2D 2 O ""pillars"" extending between the CoO 2 planes. This interesting ""pillar"" structure is further stabilized by hydrogen bonding within the planes of the D 2 O molecules to form zigzag D-O•D-O•D-O. chains. These structural results are in contrast to initial reports that implied that the material could be viewed a solid solution that could intercalate both Na and D 2 O in varying amounts. The ideal composition of the superconducting phase is Na x CoO 2 •4xD 2 O (x≈1/3). The sample studied here has a refined Na composition of x=0.31(3) and a perfect 1:4 Na to D 2 O ratio (within one esd) consistent with the ideal structure, but with vacancy defects on both the Na and D 2 O sites; i.e., entire 2D 2 O-Na-2D 2 O ""pillar"" sites are vacant. . This hydrated phase would be expected to exist only within rather narrow composition limits. For x≥1/3, fourfold coordination of Na by D 2 O molecules cannot be achieved. As x approaches 1/4, a different ordered phase, involving sixfold coordination of the Na, could be formed. Thus, measurements of physical properties, such as T c, vs. composition should be viewed with caution until it is confirmed that all samples in a particular study are in the same phase.","1"

In the β-pyrochlore RbOs 2 O 6 , A is the monovalent cation Rb, and B is the transition metal cation Os octahe- drally coordinated by O. It is derived from the parent compound by replacing the O ′ atoms by Rb atoms and leaving the 16d site empty (AB 2 O 6 ≡ 2 B 2 O 6 A ′ , where represents a vacancy). The Os atoms are coordinated by 6 O atoms and these OsO 6 octahedra share corners. They have edge-lengths of 2.67 and 2.72Å respectively, and the Os -O bonding distance is 1.91Å. The electron donating Rb atoms are coordinated by O with a Rb -O distance of 3.13Å. From X-ray measurements, we refine the 48f oxygen x parameter to 0.315(1). This results in O -Os -O angles in the octahedra of 88.85 • and 91.15 • . The B site may accommodate an ion carrying a localized magnetic moment, which in- teracts antiferromagnetically with its nearest neighbors. Since the B sublattice consists of interconnected tetrahedra, we have to account for the 3-dimensional geometrical frustration of the magnetic interactions, possibly leading to an unconventional groundstate. The inset of Fig. 1 shows an Os atom and its relationship to its surrounding. Every Os atom forms the shared corner of two Os tetrahedra in a network. The exchange pathways to the nearest neighbors, leading by one of the coordinating oxygen atoms, are shown by dashed lines.

To our knowledge, the B -O -B angle in RbOs 2 O 6 is surpassed only by one other pyrochlore, the bulk superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7.

This might be interpreted as a sign of an unconventional superconducting state with part of the Fermi surface ungapped. Alternatively, if part of the sample does not undergo a superconducting transition, then the measured curve is the sum of the superconducting and normal contributions. Indeed, such an analysis appears to yield consistent results, suggesting a conventional BCS-like superconducting state. Following the second interpretation, we proceed to further analyze C p below T c . Starting with the 12 T data as the normal state reference, we subtract 23.4 % of it (shown in the inset of Fig. ) from the 0 T set.

Down to 1 K, the specific heat in the superconducting state decreases in close quantitative agreement with conventional superconducting behavior. Below that, the subtraction of the two components provides unreliable results, since the difference becomes exceedingly small. Furthermore, impurities play an essential role at such low temperatures, and it is thus difficult to draw conclusions from the observed deviation.

Werthamer et al. have worked out a theory for H c2 which includes both spin and orbital paramagnetic effects as well as nonmagnetic and spin-orbit scattering . In RbOs 2 O 6 , the upper critical field does not, however, behave as predicted by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula in the dirty limit, as can be seen in Fig .

"2731","PHC1910237","2","The family of copper oxide superconductors is broadly based on the structural interleaving of CuO 2 planes with a variety of metal-oxygen layers. These layers act as separators, in effect defining the CuO 2 planes, and also often as charge reservoirs to control the hole or electron concentration. In the past two years the discovery of new cuprate superconductors has become more difficult, as simple combinations of elements and standard processing techniques have become exhausted in the search. Complex chemis- try, high oxygen pressures or high hydrostatic pres- sures have been employed recently to discover new materials . Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity at 28 K in Sr 2 Nd 1.5 Ce 0.5 NbCu 2 -O 10-δ (and the Ta analog), a previously reported compound with a single Nb(Ta)O 6 octahedral layer between the apices of pyramidal (CuO 5 ) ∞ planes. The bases of the pyramids are separated by a fluorite layer (). The Nb(Ta)O 6 octahedral layer is a new kind of intermediary layer for high-T c copper oxides, and the Nb and Ta charges of +5 are the highest yet on cations to be accommodated in such a layer. The (Nb, Ta-O) octahedral layers join (Tl-O) and (Pb, Cu-O) octahedral layers, (PbO-Cu-PbO) and (Bi-O) distorted pyramids, Cu-O sticks and chains, and possibly GaO 4 tetrahedra , as building blocks for new materials. The oc- tahedra in the new layer share corners, not edges as in (Tl-O) and (Pb, Cu-O) octahedral intermediary layers. The compound is a good bulk superconductor only for a narrow range of compositions and con- ditions of oxygen pressure, temperature, reaction time and cooling rate, striking a delicate balance among solid solubility, cation ordering, and oxygen content in the determination of its properties.","1"
"2732","PHC1910237","3","Efforts to determine the composition and optimal processing conditions for the superconducting phase were concentrated in the Nb based material. Starting materials were SrCO 3 , freshly dried Nd 2 O 3 , Ce 2 (C 2 O 4 ) 3 ·9H 2 O, Nb 2 O 5 (Ta 2 O 5 ) and CuO, mixed to yield Sr 2 Nd 2-x Ce x NbCu 2 O 10 for 0.4 x 0.7, ∆x=0.05, based on the earlier reported composition of the phase and the expected optimal con- centration for superconductivity, x 0.6 (which cor- responds to a nominal hole concentration of 0.2/Cu). The phase had been reported to be semiconducting in this composition range, although some resistive Ta based samples showed a peak in ρ(T) near 60 K which was attributed either to a magnetic transition or filamentary superconductivity . Our initial mixtures were heated at 200°/min to 1000°C in flowing O 2 and then heated at that temperature in O 2 for 70-90 h with 2 intermediate mechanical grind- ings. Powders were then pressed into pellets and sub- jected to a variety of treatments . The pro- cessing procedures were designed in the attempt to separate the effects of phase purity, cation order/dis- order, and oxygen stoichiometry in the attainment of superconducting material. Although small amounts of superconductivity were observed for many pro- cessing procedures, only under a narrow set of con- ditions was bulk superconductivity obtained in es- sentially single phase material, allowing identification of the Sr 2 Nd 2-x Ce x NbCu 2 O 10 type phase as a bulk superconductor. Optimal Ce concentrations were found to be between x=0.5 and 0.6. The best pro- cessing involved long treatment times (60 h or more) at temperatures of 1100-1125°C in an oxygen or 25 atmosphere oxygen ambient with cooling in the furnace to 500°C before removal. The 25° temper- ature window between 1100 and 1125°C, long treat- ment times, and cooling rate are all critical to the at- tainment of good quality material.","0"
"2733","PHC1910237","4","Although the phase assemblages are different in detail at the different processing temperatures, the Sr 2 Nd 1-x Ce x NbCu 2 O 10 type phase is present at the 90% or greater level for 0.5 x 0.7 in all cases. This suggests that the long time/high temperature treat- ment is necessary either to promote cation ordering, (for instance among Nb and Cu; or Sr, Ce and Nd) or that the superconductivity occurs in bulk material only in the narrow composition range near Ce=0.5-0.6 and that nearly perfect single phase material is necessary to observe it. The best phase purity was observed in the 1100 and 1125 treatments at 25 atm O 2 pressure. At 1125°C and 25 atm for instance, there was less than 5% impurity phase in the com- position range 0.5 x 0.7. It would be very unusual for small differences in phase purity or Ce content to have such a profound effect on the occurrence of superconductivity in this kind of system suggesting that the processing procedure is very critical. Cation ordering, probably between Nb and Cu, is likely to be the key result of the long anneals.","0"
"2734","PHC1910237","5","Samples which were quenched from 800°C or higher were not bulk superconductors suggesting that oxygen uptake below 800°C on cooling could be crit-ical to the occurrence of superconductivity but not excluding the possibility of order/disorder effects. The disappearance of superconductivity in all good materials, however, was always accompanied by a small weight loss. Treatment of good superconduct- ing Sr 2 Nd 1.5 Ce 0.5 NbCu 2 O 10-δ (prepared at 1125°C, 25 atm O 2 ) for 4 h at 600°C in N 2 resulted in a weight loss of 0.25% (and single phase material) corre- sponding to an oxygen loss of approximately 0.13 per formula unit, or 0.13 holes per copper, and the loss of superconductivity. This indicated, along with the introduction of superconductivity in poor samples by re-treatment in O 2 , that the oxygen content of the phase is a critical parameter. Determination of the absolute oxygen content of the material is difficult because Nb 2 O 5 and CeO 2 are only partially reduca- ble (not to stoichiometric oxides) on heating in the TGA to 1000° in H 2 , our standard method for ox- ygen content determination. Finely powdered ma- terial can, however, be reduced in a 5% H 2 -95% N 2 mixture at 500°C, a temperature where CeO 2 and Nb 2 O 5 will not lose any oxygen on heating. Reduc- tion of Sr 2 Nd 1.5 Ce 0.5 NbCu 2 O 10-δ prepared at 1125°C and 25 atm O 2 pressure indicated that δ=0.05 , yielding an approximate doping of 0.2 holes/copper; near the optimal expected value. The weight loss data are shown in . Note that samples annealed at 25 atm O 2 pressure and cooled by turning off the fur- nace are better superconductors than those cooled more slowly (entries 16 and 17 in table 1), suggest- ing that over-oxygenation may be possible for Ce 0.5.","0"

In-plane tensile strain, induced by lat- tice mismatch through thin-film growth, increases the superconducting transition temperature T c to 41.8 K; this enhancement was attributed to a decrease in the E 2g phonon frequency .

For the Ca-substituted system, a possible supercon- ductivity was also reported in the weak-ferromagnetic compounds RuCa 2 RCu 2 O 8 (R = Pr-Gd). The metallic weak-ferromagnetic (WFM) order is originated from the long range order of Ru moments in the RuO 6 octahedra due to strong Ru-4d xy,yz,zx -O-2p x,y,z hybridization in this strongly-correlated electron sys- tem. The Curie temperature T C ∼ 130 K observed from magnetization measurement in the prototype compound RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 is probably a canted G-type antiferromagnetic order with Ru 5+ moment µ canted along the tetragonal basal plane resulting a small net spontaneous magnetic moment µ s ≪ µ(Ru 5+ ) too small to be detected in neutron diffraction. The occurrence of high-T c superconductivity with maximum resistivity onset T c (onset) ∼ 60 K in RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 is related with the quasi-two-dimensional CuO 2 bi- layers separated by a rare earth layer in the Ru-1212 structure. Broad resistivity transition width ∆T c = T c (onset) -T c (zero) ∼ 15-20 K observed is most likely originated from the coexistence and the inter- play between superconductivity and weak-ferromagnetic order. The diamagnetic T c is observed anomalously at lower temperature near T c (zero) instead of at T c (onset), and a reasonable large Meissner signal was reported using stationary sample magnetometer with diamagnetic T c ∼ 30 K in ≤ 1 G applied field at zero-field-cooled (ZFC) mode. Lower T c (onset) ∼ 40 K and 12 K were observed for RuSr 2 EuCu 2 O 8 and RuSr 2 SmCu 2 O 8 , respectively. No superconductivity can be detected in RuSr 2 RCu 2 O 8 (R = Pr, Nd). 3,16 Superconducting RuSr 2 YCu 2 O 8 phase is stable only under the high pressure.

In contrast, 5d pyrochlore oxides often show a metallic conductivity due to direct overlap of 5d orbitals .

Band calculation by Brennan and Burdett shows that its conductivity mainly comes from Ag5s orbital, and that its Fermi surface has a quasi-three-dimensional character because both the silver chain and Kagome lat- tice contribute to the density of states at the Fermi level. Interestingly, the resistivity behaves as ρ = AT 2 + ρ 0 in an unusually wide range of temperature, down to below 4 K and up to room temperature . This means that unknown strong scattering mechanism dominates over the usual electron-phonon scattering. Superconductiv- ity of Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6 was recently suggested by the present authors .

All the mea- surements reported here were performed with a 4 He-3 He dilution refrigerator (Cryoconcept, Model DR-JT-S-100-10), covering the measurement temperatures as low as 16 mK. The resistivity was measured using a conven- tional four-probe method with an AC current of 10.4 µA rms at 163 Hz with a hexagonal-stick single crystal which fits in 0.14 × 0.21 × 1.15 mm 3 . We used pure gallium to attach electrical wires of copper to the sample crystals. We note here that one must keep the temperature of the electrodes well below the melting point of gallium (29 • C) all the time after soldering in order to avoid the electri- cal contacts getting worse. We avoided using gold wires because gallium easily dissolves gold. The AC suscepti- bility was measured by a mutual inductance method. We fabricated a very small and highly-sensitive cell by wind- ing a 50-µm-diameter copper wire on a 0.5-mm-diameter polyimide tube (The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., PIT-S). The excitation field H AC was 8.7 mOe rms at 887 Hz, which is much lower than the H c of Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6. To re- duce the influences of remnant magnetic fields such as the earth's field and the residual field in the equipment, these measurements were performed in a magnetic shield. We used a cylinder of permalloy (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., E989-28), which has an extremely high permeabil- ity. Inside the permalloy tube, we also placed a lead cylinder with a closed bottom, to expel the remaining magnetic flux. The DC magnetic field for the measure- ments was applied with a small solenoidal coil of Nb-Ti superconducting wire placed inside the shield.

The other is the very large positive peaks of χ ′ AC just before the superconducting to normal tran- sitions. These peaks are ascribable to the ""differential paramagnetic effect"" (DPE) , which represents that the field derivative of the magnetization ∂M/∂H is positive near the transition and also the magnetic process in this region is reversible. In a type-I superconductor with a fi- nite size, the intermediate state takes place and the DPE should be observed. On the other hand, type-II supercon- ductors should show no or rather small DPE because of the irreversibity of magnetic process due to flux pinning.

We also define the normal to superconducting transition fields as supercooling fields H sc . This tran- sition should be from the normal to the full Meissner states since we observed no DPE. We can fit a relation H c (T ) = H c0 [1 − (T /T c0 ) α ] to all the H c data down to 16 mK using H c0 and α as fitting parameters, while T c0 = 52.4 mK is determined from the temperature sweep data in zero field.

In particular, transport properties of the normal state present a number of un- easy paradoxes for the Fermi-liquid (FL) picture. Whilst it has been argued that conventional electron-phonon (e- ph) scattering might still account for the T -linear resis- tivity in optimally doped cuprates, it is generally as- sumed that proximity to a Mott insulator, and thus the unusual strength of on-site electronic repulsion, is the fundamental reason behind the more unusual aspects of HTC physics. This general assumption is backed up by a host of experimental observations which indicate that the anomalous behavior becomes even more pronounced with decreasing the density of carriers, that is, by moving towards the underdoped side. At sufficiently high carrier concentrations however, it has often been assumed that HTC eventually evolve into a conventional FL as the elec- tron correlations become weaker and the system becomes more three-dimensional (3D).","0"

Indeed, supporting evidence for a FL ground state has only sur- faced very recently with the experimental verification of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in OD Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ (Tl2201) (T c ∼ 15K) . By suppressing superconduc- tivity in a large magnetic field, Proust et al. observed the precise WF ratio κ ab /σ ab T = L 0 , where κ ab and σ ab are the in-plane thermal and electrical conductivities and the Lorenz number L 0 = 2.44 × 10 −8 WΩ/K −2 . Sur- prisingly however, and at odds with a conventional FL picture, the WF relation was found to co-exist with a large linear resistivity term extending down to 0K. This dichotomy raises the question whether the field-induced 'normal state' in OD HTC, i.e. beyond H c2 , is the same as the ground state that would exist in the absence of a magnetic field, as it does in more conventional super- conductors. Moreover, a clear understanding of the ex- perimental situation in OD cuprates has often been com-pounded by their tendency to undergo phase separation.","1"

The fact though that κ/T (A1) and κ/T (A2) are shifted relative to one another (except at the very lowest temperatures) suggests the latter, and sim- ply by scaling κ c (T ) by a constant factor (f = 1.6) and subtracting it from κ ab (T ), we find, as shown in the inset to , that the resultant κ el /T is indeed constant for both crystals and equal to 1.07 and 0.50 mW/cm.

"2837","P068100502-CC","11","The absence of superconductivity in La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 , coupled with the emergence of a T 2 resistivity at low T , gives us a unique opportunity to compare experimen- tal manifestations of e-e correlations in La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 to other strongly correlated systems. Electronic cor- relations in a FL are known to lead to an enhance- ment in the quasi-particle effective mass. This effect can be detected through the resistivity (AT 2 ), specific heat (γ 0 T ) and magnetic susceptibility (χ p ). Empirical rela- tionships that correlate these physical parameters have been found in a wide range of strongly-correlated metals; namely, the Kadowaki-Woods (KW) ratio (A/γ 2 0 = a 0 = 10 −5 µΩcm/(mJ/Kmol) 2 ) and the Wilson ratio ) χ p /γ 0 , with R w ∼ 1 for a free electron gas and ∼ 2 for strongly-correlated fermions ).","0"

This observation reveals a new aspect of the physics of the cuprates and is the central result of this Letter. Whilst various explanations for the magni- tude of the KW ratio in heavy fermion systems have been proposed, including a strong frequency dependence of the quasi-particle self-energy and proximity to an anti- ferromagnetic instability , none have so far predicted deviations from a 0 as large as those found in the HTC. It is noted, however, that the effect of a strong momen- tum dependence in the scattering amplitude, thought to be a key feature of HTC , has yet to be taken into account and efforts to include such an effect could prove highly illuminating. As one moves across the HTC phase diagram towards the Mott insulator at half-filling, one expects e-e scat- tering to become even more intense. Thus, the grad- ual evolution from quadratic to linear resistivity in HTC must somehow reflect the growing strength of e-e inter- actions as one approaches the Mott insulator from the metallic side. As an indication of how rapidly the e-e scattering intensity might grow, we note here that ρ ab of La 1.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 4 is ≈ 2 -3 times larger than that of La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 at 300K, even though the Luttinger sum rule dictates that their carrier densities differ by only a few percent. Moreover, given the relatively minor changes observed in the phonon spectra as a function of doping, one does not expect the strength of the e-ph in- teraction to change forcibly across the phase diagram. Thus, since e-ph scattering appears to give a negligi- ble contribution to ρ ab (T ) in La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 , it seems highly unlikely now that e-ph scattering can in any way account for the linear resistivity that appears (in a nar- row composition range) around optimal doping. In the light of these results, we conclude that chronic (Umk- lapp) e-e scattering processes must dominate the normal state transport behavior of the cuprates across the entire accessible doping range. Such a scenario is consistent with the large increase in the quasi-particle lifetime be- low T c observed in thermal and electrical conductivity measurements.","0"

As shown in the upper inset to , χ(T ) displays significant anisotropy with respect to the field orientation (believed to arise from anisotropic g-values ) and a strong enhancement at low T . Assuming a constant Pauli susceptibility χ p and an isotropic Curie-Weiss term (with Θ C ∼ 7.5K), we obtain an average χ p ∼ 1.75× 10 −4 emu/mol and hence, R W ∼ 2.0, consistent with values for other strongly correlated metals . If however, all the enhancement in χ(T ) is assumed to be intrinsic, i.e. due to an enhanced χ p (T ), we obtain R W ∼ 3.5. We note here that whilst a large enhancement in χ p (T ) at low-T would imply a similar enhancement in γ(T ), such behavior would be difficult to discern from our C(T ) data due to the dominant phonon contribution.","0"

"2868","P069014507-CC","24","A well-known fact in R-123 phase superconductors is that the superconductors with higher oxygen content have smaller lattice parameters a and c. This phenomenon was also observed in the Y Sr 2 Cu 2.7 F e 0.3 O 7+δ superconductor and in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ superconductor ob- tained by high oxygen pressure synthesis. In these superconductors, the diffraction peaks of (006) and (200) shift systematically to higher angle degree with the increase of oxygen content, which is similar to our results. All our HP-samples have smaller lattice parameters a and c than the corresponding AM-samples, and the lattice unit cell of HP-samples displays an obvious shrinkage. Since the relative shrinkage is not more bigger than other samples an- nealed under high oxygen pressure, and also for that F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ sample can be made superconducting without high pressure synthesis, thereby this shrinkage can be attributed to the increase of oxygen content, but not the pressure effect caused by the high pressure synthesis procedure. Then it can be deduced that in all F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 (Ba 1−x Sr x ) 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ samples the oxygen content increased after high pressure synthesis, which is validated by the oxygen content measurement in F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ system where 7+δ increased from 7.20(2) in AM-sample to 7.35(2) in HP-sample. The increased oxygen content provided the required charge which made the semiconducting-like AM-samples changed to supercon- ducting HP-samples. The diffusion of F e atom into CuO 2 planes in R-123 systems is believed to be very unfavorable for superconductivity because of its magnetic moment, and with the increase of F e concentration, this diffusion is inevitable in samples synthesized by common solid-state reaction . J. Shimoyama et al. used a complex annealing procedure which is believed to suppress the incorporation of F e to the CuO 2 planes in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ system, and finally made it superconducting with T c ∼ 60K. Using neutron powder diffraction studies, T. Mochiku et al. investigated the site-mixing between F e and Cu atoms in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ samples synthesized through different procedures, and proved that simply increasing the oxygen content could not produce superconductivity and the ordered distribution of F e and Cu atoms between Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites is also one of the key points to the origin of superconductivity. In our heavily F e-doped R-1212 systems, high pressure synthesis procedure is believed to promote the transfer of F e atoms from Cu(2) site to Cu(1) site, and to make almost all the F e atoms to occupy the Cu(1) chain site. This redistribution of F e atoms is a needed requirement to ensure the occurrence of superconductivity, while the increase of oxygen content provides the needed amount of charge.","1"

Although the theoretical calculations of Tc values are not so accurate, the observed T c value seems to be too high to be accounted for by ordinary electron-phonon coupling mechanisms.

First of all, the superconducting properties are closely related to magnetism, indicating that magnetic interaction may be involved in the superconductivity.

Contrary to the widely observed behavior for underdoped cuprates at lower Zn contents (where the pseudogap energy increases almost linearly with decreasing p in the same way as for the Zn-free compounds), this apparent pseudogap temperature at high Zn content showed very little or no p-dependence. It also increases systematically with increasing Zn concentration in the CuO 2 planes. This anomalous behavior appears quite abruptly, e.g., samples with y ≤ 0.05 exhibit the usual T * (p) behavior.

Pure Y123 with full oxygen loading (δ=0), is only slightly OD, further overdoping is achieved by substituting Y 3+ by Ca 2+ . The advantages of using Zn are: (i) It mainly substitutes the in-plane Cu(2) sites, thus the effects of planar impurity can be studied and (ii) the doping level remains nearly the same when Cu(2) is substituted by Zn enabling one to look at the effects of disorder at almost the same hole concentration .

There is a systematic shift of p opt towards higher values (from p opt = 0.16 for the impurity-free case) and an increase in Z with increasing Zn content. These findings have important consequences. Increasing Z(y) implies the shrinkage of the p-range over which the compound is superconducting upon Zn substitution, and the shift of p opt (y) towards higher values implies that the superconducting dome is displaced asymmetrically towards the overdoped side. This latter feature, we believe, is indicative of a fundamental difference between the underdoped and the overdoped regions, namely the existence of the pseudogap in the underdoped region and its absence in the overdoped region . From Fig.it is also seen that SC is at its strongest at p ~ 0.186, as this remains the last point of SC at a critical Zn concentration (defined as the highest possible Zn concentration for which SC just survives considering all the possible doping states).

Even at fairly high hole concentration, (p ~ 0.180) ρ(T) is non-metallic over the whole experimental temperature range from 300K, indicating significant carrier localization induced by Zn in the CuO 2 plane and also due to some extrinsic effects like the degree of porosity of the sintered sample. The most striking feature of the ρ(T,p) data is the downturn in resistivity at around 230 ± 5K, almost independent of planar hole concentration p. This downturn is somewhat masked for samples with higher oxygen deficiency (smaller p) due to the stronger non-metallic behavior over the whole temperature range. These downturns in the ρ(T) data are similar to those observed in samples with a PG (see Figs.3). But in this sample it is unusual because (i) the PG-like feature is observed in resistivity for a heavily overdoped sample (T c = 12K, whereas T cmax ~ 27.9K for y = 0.06) and (ii) T * does not seem to change with p. The former indicates the possibility of disorder giving rise to this PG-like phenomenon, whereas the latter shows that in such a case, this feature is almost independent of planar hole content, p. In Fig.2b we have shown the p-independent T * for another heavily disordered compound (S2) from the ρ(T) measurements. Although the nominal composition for S2 from a different batch was also y = 0.06 and x = 0.20, from the value of T cmax (= 32K) we think the actual Zn concentration in the CuO 2 plane is a little lower, probably ~ 5.5%. T * for this sample is ~ 205 ± 5K. Several ρ(T) measurements were done for these samples after each oxygen annealing and measurements were also repeated after time intervals of several months. Each time we have observed the characteristic downturn in ρ(T) at the same temperature. It is worth mentioning that for a given value of p, ρ(T,p) of S1 appears to be more non-metallic than S2.","1"

The density of S2 (5.93 gm/cc) was larger than that of S1 (5.61 gm/cc). This is also supported from the values of T cmax of the samples that are well explained by the small difference in the actual levels of Zn in the CuO 2 planes. Extrinsic properties, like the quality of the conductivity at grain boundaries, can have a large effect on ρ(T) without having a noticeable effect on T c.","0"

"2915","P071184510-CC","15","Data with more than 5%Zn is rare, and when available, ρ(T) measurements were often not done over a wide enough range of hole concentrations. We have found one source of published data where ρ(T) was measured over a wide range of p-values for samples with y = 0.07. In that paper measurements were performed on high-quality c-axis oriented thin films of YBa 2 (Cu 1- y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ . We show the in-plane resistivity, ρ ab (T) , for Cu 0.93 Zn 0.07 ) 3 O 7-δ in Fig.2c. A p- independent T * is seen again at 250 ± 5K. From the reported 28 values of oxygen deficiencies for this film, we estimate the hole concentrations to be in the range p = 0.17 to 0.11 (within ± 0.01). At this point it is important to notice that resistivity of this crystalline thin film is not affected by the presence of significant grain boundary resistance. This illustrates the role played by Zn as the principal source of disorder giving rise to the appearance of this PG-like feature in these samples. It also appears that T * in these heavily disordered samples is determined by the amount of Zn in the CuO 2 plane. For example, we have T * = 205 ± 5K, 230 ± 5K, and 250 ± 5K for samples with ~ 5.5%Zn, 6%Zn, and 7%Zn respectively. However, ρ(T) of 4%Zn substituted samples shows the usual T * (p) behavior as was found for the Zn-free samples (see Fig.3b). This indicates that the presence of a disorder induced PG temperature is a non-linear function of Zn concentration and, at least in the ρ(T) measurements, it reveals itself only in the highly disordered state.

Once again quite different features are seen for these two samples compared with other sintered Y 1-x Ca x Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ samples with y ≤ 0.05 (see Fig.5). First, the magnitude of the low-field ACS signal at low-T is largely reduced for the y > 0.05 samples and shows a strong p-dependence, namely the ACS signal reduces rapidly with the decrease of hole content in the UD side. Both these features are absent for other samples for up to 5%Zn concentration (see Figs.5a and 5b). Second, the field dependent ACS signals as a function of temperature show the same qualitative features for both the sintered pellet and powder for S1 (see Figs.4c and 4d), showing the absence of any coupling T c and also the absence of any intergrain contribution to the shielding current. The reduction in the normalized ACS signal in powdered sample simply implies that grain size is further reduced due to grinding. The rapid reduction of the low-field ACS signal with increasing underdoping in S1 and S2 suggests that the superconducting volume fraction decreases rapidly with decreasing hole concentration. Whereas for a less disordered sample (Fig.5d), the field dependent ACS clearly shows the intergrain shielding component and the grain-coupling temperature (T coupling ) 29 .","0"
"2917","P071184510-CC","17","Zn is believed to destroy superconductivity and superfluid density on a local scale (of the order of in-plane superconducting coherence length, ξ ab ) . This seems to agree with ACS data for up to 5%Zn substitution where the low-field bulk ACS signal showed little variation with Zn and the entire volume of the sample contributes to the ACS signal at low-temperature. It is possible that for heavily Zn-substituted samples the effect is not local any more and some kind of phase segregation (between superconducting and non- superconducting regions) over a macroscopic length scale takes place. Alternatively, the superfluid density in these highly disordered samples can be extremely low . At temperatures near T c , the temperature derivative of the ACS signal for the powdered samples can be used to estimate the zero- temperature superfluid density, n s0 . The temperature derivative of the ACS signal can be used to represent the quantity , where N is a constant depending on the shape of the grains, and a denotes the average grain size. In our calculations we have assumed N and a to be the same for all samples under consideration. This is a reasonable approximation because these compounds had nearly identical density and grinding of the pellets was done in exactly the same manner. We have calculated the fractional suppression in n s0 as a function of Zn content for 3%Zn and 6%Zn substituted samples with p = 0.20 ± 0.005 (therefore, similarly heat treated). The results are as follows, for the 6%Zn sample is reduced to just 7% of its value for the Zn-free case at the same hole content. Whereas, n s0 /T c for the 3%Zn sample is reduced to 48% of its value for the Zn-free case. The above findings agree quite well with those obtained by Panagopoulos et al. from their London penetration depth measurements on magnetically aligned powders (grains).","0"

Details of magneto-transport measurements can be found elsewhere . The field broadening of the resistive transition is shown in 6b for the 3%Zn substituted sintered and 2%Zn substituted thin film samples respectively. The difference between the values of T c-onset at 0 Tesla and 12 Tesla is ~ (4.5 ± 1)K (see Fig.6a) but the difference in T c defined at the zero resistivity under these two applied fields is ~ (18 ± 1)K for the sintered sample. For the thin film with magnetic field parallel to the c-axis, these values are ~ (6 ± 1)K and ~ (20 ± 1)K respectively. Such field broadening of the resistive transition is a general property for cuprates and one possible explanation is in terms of the unconventional vortex dynamics for these compounds 33 . Interestingly, the field broadening for the y = 0.06 sintered sample (S1) is insignificant even though the resistive transition itself is quite broad. For example, the difference between the values of T c-onset at 0 Tesla and 12 Tesla is (9.5 ± 1)K and the difference in T c defined at the zero resistivity under these two applied fields is ~ (11 ± 1) (Fig.6c), indicating almost complete absence of field broadening. It is worth mentioning that such behavior is observed for conventional low-T c superconductors where the physics of flux pinning is dominated by quite different SC state parameters, e.g., ξ is large and far less anisotropic, and T c itself is much lower. One possible reason for this small field broadening for the highly disordered sample could be due to the presence of unusually strong pinning in this compound. In fact, the ACS and the ρ(T) measurements on S1 and S2 lend support for this assumption. The bulk of this 6%Zn sample contains significant parts which are poorly conducting and can act as a source of strong vortex pinning similar to the intrinsic pinning observed in high-T c cuprates when flux-flow in the poorly conducting c-direction is greatly blocked by the poorly conducting charge reservoir layers.","0"

"2920","P071184510-CC","20","The observed PG-like features for highly disordered Y 1-x. Ca x Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ is surprising considering the widely held belief that the energy scale of the PG is determined by p, and T * (p) either falls below or merges with the T c (p) line in the OD side. In a previous magnetic susceptibility study, Cooper and Loram 34 observed a PG-like feature in fully oxygenated sintered 7%Zn-Y123, where superconductivity was almost completely suppressed with Zn. Vobornik et al. also observed a pseudogap in ARPES experiments for disordered optimally doped Bi-2212 single crystals 35 . For Bi-2212, in-plane disorder was introduced by electron irradiation and T c was reduced from 90K to 62K. ρ ab (T) was also measured but no high-T downturn in resistivity for this 62K optimally doped Bi-2212 was found 35 . In the light of present results, a possible reason might be that the sample was not ""sufficiently"" disordered, since we also did not see any anomalous effect in our 3%, 4%, and 5%Zn samples (where T c was suppressed by ~ 30K, ~ 40K, and ~ 46K respectively, near the optimum doping). Notice that all the previous observations of disorder induced PG were for samples that are slightly OD and optimally doped respectively . Here we have reported this effect over a fairly wide doping range from p = 0.205 to 0.11. It is fair to say that there are two main effects of Zn substitution for Cu(2) in cuprates : (i) Zn tends to localize carriers in the CuO 2 plane (depending on temperature and Zn content) and (ii) it gives rise to ""Curie- like magnetic moments"" possibly on the four neighboring Cu sites (in the presence of short-range antiferromagnetically correlated background). Recent 63 Cu NMR and inelastic neutron scattering studies suggest that Zn enhances the AF correlation in Y123. There is growing evidence that an AF background with short-range order does not exist in overdoped cuprates with p > 0.19 . The situation in highly disordered samples could be different, especially if there is phase segregation, and only a very weak form of superconductivity is present. Under these circumstances Zn induced enhancement of short-range AF correlation might be a possibility for highly disordered Y 1-x Ca 1-x Ba 2 (Cu 1- y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ irrespective of the hole content. It is very interesting to note that both the effects of Zn substitution (enhancement of short-range AF correlation or/and carrier localization in the CuO 2 plane) can be directly linked to the existence of the pseudogap. AF fluctuation has been held widely responsible for (or at least partly contributing to) the formation of the PG by various theoretical and experimental studies . In another scenario, using the t-J model, strong Coulomb repulsion has been taken as responsible for both pseudogap and superconducting pairing . In the VHS scenario leads to localization of carriers and thus weakens the electrostatic screening, which, in turn effectively increases the Coulomb interaction. As Zn plays a similar role on carrier transport in the CuO 2 planes, it can give rise to a pseudogap in the VHS scenario. It is hard to reconcile any precursor-pairing picture with this anomalous T * (p). On the other hand, scenarios in which the PG originates from correlations that are not related and compete with superconductivity, can possibly offer an explanation. In the competing correlations scenario T * (p) and T c (p) are detrimental to each other and the growth of one is accompanied by the decrease of the other (at least in the pure compounds). Kohno et al. 45 have in fact shown in their theoretical analysis that disorder can indeed strengthen one competing phase (AF) significantly over the other (e.g., superconductivity). The abrupt appearance of this anomalous PG-like feature in resistivity as a function of disorder content is indicative of some sort of threshold mechanism in action, consistent with some recent theoretical studies 5,46 . For example, in the study by Monthoux 5 it was shown that as quasiparticle life-time becomes shorter (with increasing scattering by spin fluctuations), it starts to ""feel"" long-range magnetic order even when only short-range correlations are present. The quasiparticle mean-free path relative to the correlation length of the short-range AF order determines the size of the pseudogap. As the quasiparticle life-time decreases with Zn, it is possible that at a certain level of Zn in the CuO 2 plane the scattering rate becomes high enough to dominate over the more gradual p-dependent scattering. Using the Hubbard model, it was shown that a high scattering rate leads to the removal of low-energy spectral weight . In this scenario the local Coulomb repulsion, U, is the important parameter. Heavy Zn substitution increases the scattering rate, localizes quasiparticles and effectively enhances U/t (where t is the nearest-neighbor hopping energy) globally. Once U > 8t, the pseudogap becomes insensitive to U and therefore, should not show significant p- dependence . Roughly speaking, the mean distance between Zn impurities, l i , in the CuO 2 plane is given by ~ r/√z pl , where z pl = 3y/2 and r ~ 3.9Å is the distance between Cu atoms in the plane. For y = 0.06, l i ~ 13Å, close to the value of the in-plane superconducting coherence length, This should imply that once the distance between Zn atoms becomes comparable with the superconducting coherence length, abrupt changes in the various normal and superconducting state properties take place.","1"
"2921","P071184510-CC","21","Another strong possibility is that this apparently anomalous PG is completely different and independent from its conventional counterpart. The systematic behavior of T c (p,y) (see Fig.1), irrespective of Zn content, supports this assumption. In this situation a conventional T * (p) should still exist for highly disordered samples. Here a much stronger resistive feature due to the anomalous PG could obscure the features associated with the conventional T * (p) which can be detected from the ρ(T,p) for less disordered compounds.","0"

The ACS data of these heavily disordered compounds shows the superfluid density to be extremely low.

"2932","P072094504-CC","2","Shortly after the discovery of the superconductivity in MgB 2 at 39 K, several investigations of the pressure de- pendence of the superconducting critical temperature T c were carried out. Indeed, the magnitude and sign of dT c /dp may indicate a way to rise T c at ambient pressure, and moreover, help to understand the superconducting pairing mechanism. So far, all these studies show that T c decreases with increasing pressure, with a rate depend- ing on the method and the pressure medium used. The first hydrostatic measurement of T c (p) up to 0.7 GPa, re- veals that T c decreases reversibly under hydrostatic pres- sure at the rate dT c /dp = − 1.11(2) K/GPa. The be- havior of T c (p) with pressure in MgB 2 was attributed to the pressure induced lattice stiffening (increase of the phonon frequency), 5,6 rather than to the decrease in the electronic density of states N(E F ), that is only moder- ately affected by pressure. Comparison with theoreti- cal calculations supported the view that MgB 2 is a BCS superconductor with moderately strong electron-phonon coupling. Apart from T c , an other relevant superconducting pa- rameter is the magnetic field penetration depth λ. In fact the so-called superfluid density λ −2 is related to the Fermi velocity and to the density of charge carri- ers, and its temperature dependence gives information on the symmetry and on the magnitude of the supercon- ducting gap. A study of pressure effects on λ −2 (0) can give important informations on how the electronic de- grees of freedom are affected by lattice modifications and on the nature of the electron-phonon coupling. Indeed, in cuprates high temperature superconductors (HTS), a huge pressure effect on λ −2 (0) was found, in particu- lar in YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 (Y124). Part of this effect was at- tributed to the strong renormalization of the Fermi ve- locity, and therefore to the effective mass, due to the non- adiabatic coupling of the electrons to the lattice. This result is in agreement with the substantial oxygen iso- tope effect found in cuprates and can be in- terpreted in the framework of non-adiabatic theory of superconductivity. 14 In this paper we report measurements of the mag- netic penetration depth under pressure in polycrystalline MgB 2 . The temperature dependence of λ −2 (T ) was ex- tracted from the Meissner fraction f measured in a low magnetic field. A small pressure (p) effect on λ −2 (0) was found [ ∆λ −2 λ −2 = 1.5(9)%], for pressure ranging from 0.15 to 1.13 GPa. Theoretical calculations of the pressure ef- fect on λ(0) confirm the smallness of this effect [ ∆λ −2 λ −2 ≃ 1.4%]. These results contrast with the huge effect (∼ 40 %) on λ −2 (0) found in the non-adiabatic cuprate super- conductor Y124 in the same range of pressure 8 .","1"

The hydrostatic pressure was produced in a copper-beryllium piston cylinder clamp, especially de- signed for magnetization measurements under pressure (see Ref ). The sample was put in a teflon cylin- der and the pressure cell was then filled with Fluorinert FC77 as pressure transmitting medium. The Meissner fraction was calculated from low field magnetization mea- surements (field cooling) performed with a commercial Superconducting Quantum Interference Device. In the approximation of spherical grains with average radius R, the Meissner fraction can be related to the magnetic pen- etration depth via the Shoenberg formula: 16 (1) Any change in χ/χ 0 due to pressure can be attributed mainly to a change of λ(T ), rather than to a change of R, which is practically pressure independent. The sam- ple was measured at low pressure p L = 0.15 GPa and at the highest pressure available p H = 1.13 GPa. The pres- sure values were determined from a preliminary calibra- tion measurement, where the same sample was measured in the pressure cell together with a small piece of lead. The pressure was detected by measuring the T c shift of lead (T c (0kbar)=7.2K). We found dT c /dp = − 1.24(5) K/GPa, in good agreement with previous results. The real zero-pressure measurement could not be performed in the pressure cell, since, in order to seal the cell, at least a small pressure had to be applied.

The val- ues of λ −2 were then calculated using the Shoenberg for- mula (Eq. (1). The p Z and p L data were normalized at low temperature to the absolute value of λ −2 mea- sured with the muon spin rotation technique (µSR) on the same sample at zero pressure. We define the shift of λ −2 between two different pres- sures p L (lower) and p H (higher) at a temperature T as: The temperature dependences of λ −2 for p L and p H , are shown in , together with the p Z data measured in the quartz tube. The λ −2 (T ) curves for p Z and p L overlap perfectly for temperatures not too close to T c , where a small pressure shift is present. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain reliable data below 7K be- cause of a large background signal due to lead impurities in the pressure cell. Therefore, while for the p Z measure- ment in the quartz tube we show the data down to 2 K, for the p L and the p H measurements we show the data only down to 7 K (see lower panel of ). Due to the pressure effect on T c, the curves for p L and p H are clearly distinct at high temperature, but they merge at low tem- perature.

This result shows that only a very small pressure effect on λ −2 is present. The pressure results are summarized in To determine the pressure effect on the zero tempera- ture λ −2 (0), a fit to the experimental data is needed.

As we show below, an improved estimate which takes into ac- count MgB 2 band structure effects does not change much the free electron gas result. Let us consider the zero tem- perature expression of the penetration depth: 25 where the integral runs over the Fermi surface S n F of the n-th band (n = σ, π) and v n (s) is the correspond- ing surface bare electron velocity vector. Let us use the model of Ref. where the π bands are modeled by a half-torus Fermi surface of area S 1 and Fermi velocity v 1 , while the σ bands are approximated by a cylindrical Fermi surface of area S 2 and Fermi velocity v 2 . Equation (5) then reduces simply to λ −2 (0) = λ −2 where w = λ −2 is the parameter introduced in Eq.(3).

"2948","P072104504-CC","3","The magnetic field penetration depth λ is one of the fundamental lengths of a superconductor. The temper- ature dependence λ(T ) reflects the quasiparticle density of states available for thermal excitations and therefore probes the superconducting gap structure. The shape of λ(T ) and the zero-temperature value λ(0) provide infor- mation about the superconducting mechanism and set a length scale for the screening of an external magnetic field. In addition, the field dependence of λ at low tem- peratures may reflect the anisotropy of the superconduct- ing energy gap. In this paper, we report on magnetic field penetration depth measurements down to 30 mK in RbOs 2 O 6 by means of the transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF-µSR) technique (see e.g. ). The temper- ature dependence of λ −2 saturates at low temperatures and becomes constant below T ≃ 0.2T c . This behav- ior agrees with what is expected for weak-coupled s-wave BCS superconductors. Measurements of the magnetic field dependence of λ by means of TF-µSR and mag- netization reveal that at low temperatures λ is almost field independent. This result suggests that the super- conducting energy gap in RbOs 2 O 6 is isotropic.

"2954","P072104504-CC","9","To obtain the second moment of the asymmetric field distribution in the superconducting state we used the procedure similar to Refs. . All the µSR spectra taken at T < 0.85T c where the three lines are resolved were analyzed by fitting a three component expression to the P (t) data: The first term with small σ b < 0.3 MHz and B b close to the applied field corresponds to the background muons stopping in parts of the cryostat and in the nonsupercon- ducting parts of the sample. The sum corresponds to the asymmetric field distribution inside the superconductor. At 0.85T c < T < T c the two broad lines [see e.g 2)] responsible for superconducting state merge each other and the analysis is statistically correct for one supercon- ducting signal. At T > T c the analysis is simplified to the background term only with σ b = σ nm ∼ 0.1 MHz resulting from the nuclear moments of the sample. The superconductinq term in Eq. () is equivalent to the field distribution: For this distribution the mean field and the second mo- ment are 22,23 and The extracted second moment of the magnetic field dis- tribution of the vortex lattice can be expressed in fre- quency units where σ nm is the additional broadening due to the nu- clear moments measured at T > T c.

In cuprates, for example, this behavior can be ex- plained by the different type of symmetry of the wave function at the surface and in the bulk ( see e.g. ). In MgB 2 the field dependence of λ is explained by the fast suppression of the π band by the magnetic field (see e.g. ).

"2960","P072104504-CC","15","To calculate the absolute value of λ(0) from σ sc (0) one needs to know the zero temperature value of the second critical field H c2 (0) [see Eq. ]. For this reason H c2 (T ) was extracted from the M F C (T ) curves measured in con- stant magnetic fields ranging from 0.5 mT to 6 T (see Fig. ). For each particular field H the corresponding T c (H) was taken as the temperature where H = H c2 (T = T c ) (see inset in Fig. ). H c2 depends almost linearly on T with some sign of saturation below 2.5 K. Note that a lin- ear H c2 (T ) behavior was also observed in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 and recently in RbOs 2 O 6 , and in KOs 2 O 6 4 pyrochlore superconductors. In the conventional BCS picture, H c2 is linear in T near T c0 [T c0 = T c (H = 0)] and saturates by approaching 0 K. The absolute value of H c2 (0) can be obtained by using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula proposed for a weak-coupling super- conductor: H c2 (0) = 0.693(−dH c2 /dT )| T =Tc0 . The linear fit in the vicinity of T c0 yields dµ 0 H c2 /dT = −1.37(4) T/K and T c0 = 6.32(19) K. The correspond- ing value of µ 0 H WHH c2 (0) was found to be 6.00T.

By analyzing λ(H) in different su- perconducting materials, it was concluded that in super- conductors associated with an anisotropic energy gap λ increases almost linearly with the field. This effect was explained by the Doppler shift of the quasiparticles mo- mentum in the gap nodes. It was also shown that in unconventional superconductors the slope (h = H/H c2 ) lies in a range of 1 to 6, while it is close to zero for superconductors with the isotropic energy gap.","0"

The solid line is the theoretical σ sc (H) dependence obtained by means of Eq.

The λ vs. H dependence, reconstructed by means of Eq. and using the values of M eq (H) at T = 1.75 K is shown in . Because it is not possible to calculate the absolute value of λ from Eq. , data in are scaled to the µSR value of λ(1.75 K) at µ 0 H =1 T. It is seen that between 0.6 T and 4.8 T the λ vs H depen- dence is almost flat.

It is worth noting that for conventional bulk superconductors the ratio 2∆ 0 /k B T c is field inde- pendent, while in thin films and in granular materials the dependence is quite strong. For the thin films of Sn, Pb and In 37,38 it was experimentally observed that at the low temperatures the magnetic field dependence of the BCS ratio follows the empirical relation: where 2∆ 0 (0)/k B T c (0) is the BCS ratio at zero field.

III B). The field dependence of the energy gap may be explained if one assumes that the elec- trons moving close to the surface contribute less to the pairing energy. This may result to the decrease of the energy gap with increasing the magnetic field. To summarize, the ratio 2∆ 0 /k B T c is found in the range of 3.09-3.98 close to the weak-coupling BCS value 3.52.

There have also been several recent studies of the effects of hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure on superconductivity in La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 [14] and La 1.64 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.16 CuO 4 [15] or La 1.65 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.15 CuO 4 (the latter materials also have the LTT structure at low temperatures). These studies did not, however, include direct determinations of the structures of these materials under pressure.","0"

These values are similar to those reported for other lanthanum cuprates [11]. The results of our high-pressure x-ray diffraction experiments are summarized in top), which presents the (T, P) structural phase diagram of La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . The phase diagram exhibits several structural phases (LTO1, LTO2, and LTT) as a function of temperature at ambient and low pressures, but with increasing pressure first the LTT phase is eliminated, and above 4.0 GPa only the HTT phase is observed. In the La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 system it is known [2-4] that the LTT and the LTO2 phases strongly suppress superconductivity, leading to anomalously low ambient pressure T c values. According to the structural phase diagram in Figure 6 (top), as the applied pressure is increased from ambient to above 4.0 GPa, the LTT and LTO2 phases vanish and the T c should increase by as much as an order of magnitude. In (bottom) we show the results of two consecutive high-pressure measurement series on La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 to pressures as high as 19 GPa. To experimental accuracy, T c (P) is identical for both experiments and is seen to be reversible in pressure over the entire pressure range. For the second experiment (unprimed numbers) it is interesting to note that, as the pressure is released below 6 GPa, the superconducting transition broadens markedly. This may signal that the sample has entered a multiphase region as the HTT phase converts to the LTO2 and LTT phases.","0"
"2996","P071104513-CC","17","As the pressure is increased to 5.0 GPa, T c is seen to increase at the rapid rate of approximately +4.1 K/GPa, presumably due to the suppression of the LTT and LTO2 phases with pressure. In La 1.875 Ba 0.125 CuO 4 , dT c /dP = +10(±2) K/GPa [11-13], more than twice the value we measure in La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . We expect that dT c /dP will scale inversely with the ambient pressure CuO 6 tilt angle, and this angle is smaller in La 1.875 Ba 0.125 CuO 4 than in La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 [3]. At pressures greater than 5.0 GPa, where La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 is in the HTT phase, T c is seen to decrease nearly linearly with pressure at the rate dT c /dP = -0.78(8) K/GPa. For comparison, in optimally doped La 1.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 4 T c is found to decrease with pressure above 4.0 GPa at the somewhat higher rate dT c /dP = -1.2 K/GPa [21], but the maximum T c is nearly twice as high for La 1.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 4 as for La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . It is plausible that the decrease of T c with pressure in the HTT phase is primarily due to the negative dT c /dP associated with c-axis compression [11, 14, 15]. The maximum value of T c (P) for La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 is approximately 22 K at 5 GPa for the HTT phase, whereas for a La 1.88 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 polycrystalline sample T c ≈ 30 K for the LTO1 phase at ambient pressure [2]. The lower maximum T c for La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 may be an effect of the increased disorder 10 associated with Nd substitution, although a similar maximum value of T c has also been observed [11-13] for La 1.875 Ba 0.125 CuO 4 under hydrostatic pressure. Another possibility is the presence of residual charge order in La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 in the HTT phase (see discussion below).","1"
"2997","P071104513-CC","18","The pressure dependence of T c to 1.0 GPa has recently been determined [14] resistively on a La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 crystal with the same nominal stoichiometry as our sample. The results of that study were interpreted to show that a hydrostatic pressure of 0.2 GPa is sufficient to stabilize the HTT phase in La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . Our structural and T c measurements, however, consistently find that a much higher pressure of 4.2 GPa is required to stabilize the HTT structure in this material. One plausible origin for this large discrepancy is the much greater sensitivity of resistivity measurements to the T c values in minority regions such as crystallographic twin boundaries, which may contain LTO2, LTO1 or HTT phases [23] with higher T c values than the bulk phase. A second possibility is that the pressure in that study was not fully hydrostatic, yielding an exceptionally rapid increase of T c . A similar rapid rise of T c has been reported for LTT La 1.64 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.16 CuO 4 under uniaxial pressure applied parallel to the (110) axis [15]: a pressure of only 0.3 GPa increased T c from T c = 10 K to ~17 K. A linear extrapolation of the data in reference [15] suggests that a uniaxial pressure of ~0.5 GPa along the (110) direction would increase T c to 22 K, the value we observe under a hydrostatic pressure of 5.0 GPa. If the uniaxial pressure suppresses the LTT phase in favor of the HTT phase, then the data in reference [15] suggest that a uniaxial pressure of only 0.5 GPa in the (110) direction is sufficient to accomplish this structural transformation! Structural 11 measurements under uniaxial compression using single crystal x-ray or neutron diffraction are necessary to test this possibility.","1"
"2998","P071104513-CC","19","The maximum T c of 22 K is found in the HTT phase of La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . This conclusion is consistent with results for La 1.88 Ba 0.12 CuO 4 [4, 11], as well as with other observations that suggest the highest superconducting transition temperatures occur when the Cu-O planes in lanthanum cuprates are flat, that is there are no tilt distortions [24]. Within the stripe scenario, the HTT structure has no pinning potential in the Cu-O planes to lead to charge ordering and consequent suppression of superconductivity. In addition, there is no Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction in the HTT phase, and the interlayer magnetic exchange is fully frustrated. Thus the HTT structure should provide the most homogeneous and magnetically isotropic environment of the four tilt structures listed in Table I. Very recent experimental work using scanning tunneling microscopy has highlighted the presence of charge ordering with (4a x 4a) or (4.5a x 4.5a) periodicities in the underdoped cuprates Na x Ca 2-x CuO 2 Cl 2 [6] and Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ, respectively.","1"

If so, this would provide indirect evidence for residual charge order in the HTT phase of La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . This type of data has been presented [13] for La 2- x Ba x CuO 4 , and does show a local minimum of T c at x = 1/8. Unfortunately, high-pressure structural data were not presented in that work, nor were the superconducting T c s measured to pressures high enough to observe a clear maximum value of T c (as we see for La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 in ). Thus we believe it is not safe to conclude at this time that there is a local minimum of T c in the HTT phase of La 2-x Ba x CuO 4 , or any other lanthanum cuprates, when x = 1/8. Clarifying this issue is, however, an important goal for future high-pressure experiments. In addition, it would be very interesting to directly observe, by neutron or x-ray scattering, the charge-ordered state in these materials as a function of pressure. Such measurements will be difficult, however, because the charge- order superlattice peaks are weak in the LTT phase , and must be detected in the presence of the background scattering from the diamond anvil or other type of pressure cell. It is also well-known that La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 at ambient pressure shows a local minimum of T c at x = 1/8 , suggesting that some charge and spin order exists in the LTO1 phase of this material as well. In fact, incommensurate elastic magnetic peaks have been reported in neutron-scattering measurements for La 1.88 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 , although no direct evidence yet exists for charge order. In total, these results reinforce the unique nature of the electronic state at x = 1/8 in the lanthanum cuprates, and the strong coupling of this state to the structural distortions, although we still lack a complete understanding of these phenomena.","1"

"3012","P068132504-CC","2","The recent discovery of superconductivity in two-dimensional CoO 2 layers in the com- pound Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O has attracted attention because of its possible similarity to the high-T c superconductivity in CuO 2 -planes of the cuprate systems but with a different spin state associated with Co. The compound appears to be the first superconducting layered metal oxide involving 3d-transition metals other than copper. The de-intercalation of Na + ions accompanied by an intercalation of water molecules results in a combined doping and c-axis expansion effect effectively reducing the interlayer coupling between the CoO 2 planes and enhancing the two-dimensional character of the structure. Magnetic susceptibility mea- surements have shown a diamagnetic drop below 5 K ascribed to the onset of superconduc- tivity although the estimated volume fraction is only of the order of 10% of the value for perfect diamagnetism. The high-field dependence of the susceptibility resembles that of the high-T c copper oxides, with little change of the onset but an appreciable broadening of the superconducting transition under increasing magnetic field. Because of these similarities and the fact that the removal of water suppresses the superconductivity it was suggested that the large separation of the CoO 2 layers and the reduced interaction between them is essential for stabilizing the superconducting state. The major difference to the square CuO 2 planes of the cuprates is the triangular symmetry of the Co-lattice that may lead to possible frustration effects in the magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetically interacting cobalt spins. Theoretical treatments therefore employ the t-J model on a planar triangular lattice. Different magnetic and superconducting orders, e.g. d-wave superconductivity, 2 a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking d x 2 −y 2 + id xy ground state, and spin triplet superconductivity 4 have been proposed. To distinguish between different theoretical proposals and to facilitate our basic understanding of superconductivity in Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O far more experimental work needs to be conducted. In particular, the dependence of the superconducting state on the interlayer coupling is of interest. The CoO 2 interlayer coupling should be tuned reversibly by changing the distance between the planes (c-axis lattice parameter) without affecting the chemical composition, i.e. the content of sodium and water. This can be achieved by applying hydrostatic pressure. Because of the strong lattice anisotropy and the weak bonding between the layers (the water molecules are electrically neutral although polarized) it is expected that the compression of the c-axis increases the interlayer coupling and has a major effect on the superconductivity.","1"

These data are marked by filled squares in Fig. . This again shows that the sample is stable and the superconducting properties are reversible under hydrostatic pressure. The T c (p) as estimated from the onset of the diamagnetic signal (see inset of Fig. ) is displayed in Fig. . For low pressure the change of T c is relatively small. With increasing pressure the T c decreases faster resulting in a non linear dependence T c (p) as shown in Fig. The solid line is a fit of the data to a parabolic pressure dependence, T c (p) = 4.68 − 0.0047 p − 0.183 p 2 (T c in K and p in GPa). At the highest pressure of this experiment (1.53 GPa) the superconducting transition dropped to 4.2 K. Extrapolating the parabolic dependence to T c =0 yields a critical pressure of p c ≃ 5 GPa. The recovery of the T c after pressure release is indicated by the filled square in Fig. 2 (in contrast to the open circles denoting data estimated within the increasing pressure cycle). It should be noted that in the present experiments the pressure medium was frozen at the superconducting transition temperature. This may result in deviations from pure hydrostatic conditions and small pressure gradients throughout the sample space could be expected. Any pressure medium, even He gas at elevated pressure, will solidify at these low temperatures. In order to check on possible pressure gradients we have evaluated the width of the diamagnetic drop of the ac susceptibility in passing the superconducting transition of the lead manometer. The cooling speed was electronically controlled as low as 0.01 K/min. The width of the lead transition (as measured between the 90% and 10% drop of the susceptibility) was even at the highest pressure still below 0.01 K and only slightly larger than the zero pressure value of 0.008 K. If the small difference is attributed to a pressure gradient across the volume of the lead sample the inhomogeneity is less than 0.005 GPa at the maximum pressure of 1.6 GPa. With the Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O samples linear dimension being about 10 times the size of the lead the possible pressure gradients are still small and should not affect the results significantly.","1"
"3017","P068132504-CC","7","A negative pressure coefficient of T c is frequently observed in low-as well as high-T c compounds. In low-T c (i.e. BCS-like, phonon-mediated) superconductivity the negative pressure shift of T c can be explained by a decrease of the electron-phonon coupling constant, λ. λ is proportional to the electronic density of states (DOS) and to the inverse of the average square of the phonon frequency. The application of pressure usually results in an increase of the phonon frequency (phonon ""hardening"" effect) and, in many instances, in a decrease of the DOS. Both effects lead to a decrease of T c , as was recently discussed, for example, in MgB 2 . The high-T c cuprate superconductors exhibit both positive as well as negative pressure coefficients, depending on the compound and the doping state. For some hole-doped copper oxides a negative dT c /dp was reported in the overdoped regime and partially attributed to a pressure-induced charge transfer but it was also shown that this charge transfer is not the only factor affecting the pressure shift of T c (for an extensive discussion see Ref. ). Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O is, however, an electron-doped system. This has to be taken into account if the present data are compared with the high-T c cuprates. For electron-doped cuprates, e.g Sm 1.88 Ce 0.12 CuO 4−y , the pressure coefficient of T c was found to be negative for a large number of systems with different chemical composition and (electron) doping. Thereby, a universal relation between the relative pressure coefficient, dlnT c /dp, and T c was proposed. According to this relation the pressure coefficient for a sample with T c =4.7 K should be of the order of -0.1 to -0.15 GPa −1 . The T c -p relation shown in Fig. is nonlinear, however, estimating the average pressure change of T c yields a value of dlnT c /dp=-0.07 GPa −1 and calculating the slope of T c (p) at the high pressure end of the graph we get dlnT c /dp=-0.1 GPa −1 . These values are in fair agreement with the typical pressure coefficient of an electron- doped high-T c superconductor with a similar ambient pressure T c.","1"
"3018","P068132504-CC","8","In the discussion of the pressure effects the lattice anisotropy has to be considered since even hydrostatic pressure may result in different compression ratios along the main crys- tallographic directions. In optimally doped YBCO, for example, the dT c /dp varies in sign and magnitude for compression along a-, b-, and c-axis resulting in a very small over- all pressure shift of T c under hydrostatic pressure conditions. The lattice anisotropy in Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O is significant due to the huge expansion of the c-axis after intercalation of water and the compression is expected to be anisotropic as well. High pressure x-ray inves- tigations can distinguish the compression of a-and c-axis and are therefore highly desirable. For the current discussion we assume that the two-dimensionality and the expansion of the c-axis by intercalation of water in Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O is the key to understand the supercon- ductivity (this is at least assumed in all previous publications). Then it is naturally to expect that a pressure induced decrease of the c-axis length results in a suppression of the superconducting state. However, the effects of in-plane compression are not clear and need to be investigated separately. Uniaxial pressure experiments using single crystals of Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O (not currently available) can help to separate the different contributions. A pressure induced charge transfer to the CoO 2 -layers (as discussed for the cuprate super- conductors) is unlikely as long as the intercalated water molecules remain neutral and the valence of the Na-ions is +1. The non-linear decrease of T c observed in our investigation is equally unusual and interesting. It may suggest the possible existence of large dispersion in the energy spectrum of the compound near its Fermi surface.","0"

The Gd ESR spectrum of samples with ≈ 1% substitution was obtained with a broadband microwave technique that measures power absorption bolometrically from 0.5 GHz to 21 GHz. This ESR spectrum is determined by the crystal field that lifts the level degeneracy of the spin 7/2 Gd 3+ ion and details of this spectrum provide information concerning oxygen ordering in the samples. The magnetic penetration depth is obtained by relating the number of Gd ions exposed to the microwave magnetic field to the frequency-integrated inten- sity of the observed ESR transitions.

"3024","P069184513-CC","2","The magnetic penetration depth λ figures prominently in many aspects of superconductivity. It is the length scale over which an external magnetic field is screened by a superconductor in the Meissner state, it sets the size of vortices in the mixed state, and it is a controlling factor in many other properties such as microwave and far infrared absorption. The fundamental importance of the penetra- tion depth is that it provides a rather direct measure of the superfluid phase stiffness ρ s ∝ 1/λ , or what is of- ten referred to as superfluid density n s /m * = 1/µ 0 e 2 λ 2 , which can be a tensor quantity due to effects such as an anisotropic effective mass m * . In the cuprates, the de- pendence of λ on temperature T and hole-doping have provided major pieces of the cuprate puzzle. Microwave measurements of ∆λ(T ) at low T revealed a linear de- pendence providing some of the first key evidence of the presence of line nodes in the superconducting gap in the cuprates 1 and the temperature dependence of λ(T ) near T c suggested that the transition is governed by 3DXY critical fluctuations. Evidence that the low temperature value of the phase stiffness ρ s (T → 0) depends linearly on T c , has been obtained from muon spin relaxation mea- surements of λ(T ). Accurate and precise measurements of the absolute value of λ(T → 0) are particularly important for un- derstanding superconductivity in the cuprates, and are critical for broad studies of doping dependence. Having an absolute value of λ is also crucial in the interpretation of other experiments that involve superfluid screening, with examples including the microwave conductivity, the lower critical field H C1 , and the conversion of measure- ments of ∆λ(T ) to the temperature dependent superfluid density ∝ 1/λ 2 (T ). However, the absolute value of λ has proven to be particularly difficult to measure. A wide va-riety of techniques exist for doing so, but each has impor- tant drawbacks that must be acknowledged. One class of techniques takes place in the mixed state, probing the length scale over which fields decay away from a magnetic vortex. Muon spin relaxation (µSR) falls into this class and suffers from the difficulty that the screening length scale obtained from a mixed state measurement in rela- tively high fields can differ from the penetration depth in the Meissner state because of non-linear and non-local effects. Vortex state measurements are also unable to di- rectly resolve the anisotropy in λ in orthorhombic materi- als because the screening currents circulate around a vor- tex. A second class of techniques measures magnetic flux exclusion from a sample in the Meissner state, essentially by measuring the magnetic susceptibility at DC, radio or microwave frequencies. These can precisely determine the temperature dependence ∆λ(T ) = λ(T ) − λ(T o ) rela- tive to a base temperature T o . However, a measurement of the absolute value amounts to a comparison between the physical volume of the sample and a susceptibility de- termination of the volume that is field-free, the difference being the small volume at the surface that is penetrated by the field. Such a measurement is most sensitive if the ratio of surface area to volume is large, which can be achieved by working with powders. However, difficulties in aligning powders and modelling the shape and size dis- tribution of grains introduce substantial uncertainties in the absolute value of λ. For a macroscopic, high quality crystal of a cuprate superconductor, it is nearly impos- sible to measure sample dimensions precisely enough to achieve an absolute measurement of λ this way, except in geometries dominated by the very large values of λ for screening currents running in theĉ-direction.","0"
"3025","P069184513-CC","3","A very direct measurement of the penetration depth has been achieved by measuring the transmission of low frequency fields through very thin films using mutual inductance techniques. While this is a very sensitive method, its chief drawbacks are the need to work with films and the difficulty of measuring anisotropy. Tech- niques that can resolve the anisotropy include far infrared and optical measurements that determine the inductive response of the superfluid at high frequencies. Such measurements are difficult because of their need for spec- tra over a very wide frequency range in order to per- form Kramers-Krönig transforms and are also suscepti- ble to error because the measured response can also in- clude screening by uncondensed carriers in addition to the superfluid. However, this approach can be used to determine the anisotropy of λ simply by polarizing the light and measuring optical properties along all of the principal axes. Such infrared determinations of the ab- solute value of λ at low temperature have been com- bined with microwave measurements of ∆λ(T ) to pro- duce the anisotropic 1/λ 2 (T ) in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y at y=0.60 and 0.95, 14 but it would be far preferable to have a more direct microwave measurement that gives the absolute value of λ, measured on the same sample as that used to determine the temperature dependence.","0"

We use this technique here to measure the absolute value of λ for all three princi- pal axes in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y . The key to the method is to embed a randomly distributed low concentration of mag- netic moments in the superconductor in such a way that they will act as local field probes and yet will minimally affect the transport properties. The magnetic moments will serve as a non-interacting spin system whose electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum is a sum of one-particle ESR transitions. The energy levels of a single spin are determined by its crystallographic environment, i.e. the charge distribution around the magnetic ion, and the re- sulting susceptibility is that of a single spin multiplied by the number of spins that participate in the ESR process. If the moments are evenly distributed in the sample, the number of spins that participate in the process is pro- portional to the fraction of the sample's volume that is exposed to the field, i.e. the volume within a penetra- tion depth of the surface. In order to count the number of spins exposed, we measure the zero field ESR absorp- tion spectrum with a microwave frequency magnetic field applied perpendicular to the principal spin axis acting as a small perturbation.","0"

The energy cost for cross-substitution of the Gd on the Ba site is pro- hibitive and such cation substitution occurs only for the lighter and larger members of the rare earth series. The ESR spectrum is determined completely by the crystal field environment of the Gd 3+ ion and therefore know- ing that there is only one site for substitution means that changes in the ESR spectrum from sample-to-sample can only be due to changes of the oxygen order in the CuO chains. Another important feature of substitution on the Y site is that the Gd impurities are expected to be weak (Born) limit quasiparticle scattering centers as was found to be the case for Ca 2+ substitution on the same site.  Born scatterers have little effect on the superfluid den- sity in the low temperature limit.

Fortunately, the broadband spectroscopy apparatus provides a means of accessing the ESR spectrum in much greater detail. Figure shows a measurement of R app s (ω) from 0.5 GHz to 21 GHz at 1.3 Kelvin for a Gd 0.01 Y 0.99 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6.99 sample. The quasiparticle ab- sorption spectrum is known to be a slowly varying, mono- tonically increasing function of frequency, and the sharp ESR absorption lines (∆f < 0.5 GHz) are superposed. We have shown previously that the low temperature mi- crowave conductivity σ 1 (ω, T ) extracted from measure- ments of R s (ω, T ) can be interpreted as that of weak- limit quasiparticle scattering from impurities, and here we attribute the small changes in the spectrum of Fig. to a slight increase in scattering due to the increased den- sity of out-of-plane defects in the Gd doped samples. In order to separate the ESR contribution from the quasi- particle conductivity, we fit to the smooth background away from the ESR peaks using a second order polyno- mial, shown as a solid line in Fig. . After subtract- ing the polynomial, the remaining quantity is equal to 1 2 µ o ωλχ ′′ (ω) (from Eq. 4). In the subsequent section, we discuss the calculation of the quantity χ ′′ (ω) from the effective spin Hamiltonian. With the theoretical curve for the susceptibility of one Gd spin in hand, we are able to fit to the experimentally determined quantity with an overall multiplicative fit parameter λ. YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y single crystals grow naturally as platelets having broad ab-plane crystal faces and thin c-axis dimensions. All of our microwave measurements involve a uniform radio frequency magnetic field H rf ap- plied parallel to the broad face of the crystal in order to minimize the effects of demagnetization, as shown schematically in Fig. . It is also known that the crys- talĉ-axis is the principal spin axis of the Gd ions, so that the ESR response is maximized in this configura- tion. The number of Gd spins that are exposed to the microwave field is governed by the effective penetration depth λ eff and, for our geometry, will always contain contributions from λ a or λ b and λ c . In the cuprates, the two-dimensionality of the CuO 2 planes results in a large anisotropy in the penetration depth: λ c ≫ λ a , λ b for all doping levels. In practice, this means that despite working with thin crystals having the in-plane dimension ℓ a,b > ∼ 10ℓ c , theĉ-axis contribution to λ eff can be large. In some cases it was also necessary to account for a small fraction t of the crystal which remained twinned (14% at most), introducing the third component of λ into the measurement. Since λ is small compared to any crystal dimension, it suffices to use a simple linearized relation for λ eff , where ℓ p is the in-plane crystal dimension parallel to the flow of diamagnetic screening currents (the geometry is that of Fig. ). Each component of λ can be isolated by combining measurements performed on the same crys- tal but with its geometry altered in a controlled manner as attained by rotating and cleaving the crystal.

"3038","P069184513-CC","16","In this section, the way in which the magnetic penetra- tion depth is obtained from our measurements of the ESR absorption spectrum is explained. This amounts to the treatment of a dilute random array of Gd 3+ ions, each having an electron spin of S = 7/2, that contribute to the measured quantity 1 2 µ 0 λχ ′′ (ω). We point out that in this work the small splitting due to the Gd isotopes with non-zero nuclear spin can be ignored. The spectrum is a result of the energy level configuration determined by the splitting of the degenerate Gd spin levels by the crystalline field. Because the spin system is dilute, it can be described by a non-interacting single-spin effec- tive crystal field (CF) Hamiltonian. The application of a microwave field, oriented perpendicular to the principal spin axis of the system, is a time dependent perturbation that induces transitions between the spin levels. When the frequency of the applied field is tuned to the splitting between two levels, a maximum in the ESR absorption is observed. The intensity of the transition is found through the application of Fermi's golden rule for the two levels that define the transition, m i and m j , which allows the transition's contribution to the susceptibility to be writ- ten as In this expression, the eigenstates m i and m j correspond to the energies E i and E j . The level occupation number is N i = N 0 Z −1 exp(−βE i ), where N 0 is the number of spins per unit volume, Z is the partition function and β = 1/k B T is the inverse temperature. The time depen- dent perturbation induced by the microwave field, H rf , is proportional to the S x or S y operator and the matrix el- ement between the two states is µ ij = gµ B m j |S x/y |m i , where g is the Landé factor and µ B is the Bohr magneton.","0"
"3039","P069184513-CC","17","In real materials the ESR transitions are broadened by various relaxation processes such as spin-spin interac- tions, lattice disorder and spin-lattice interactions. This broadening, however, does not change the overall inten- sity of the ESR line, but merely replaces the delta func- tion by some line shape function (in our case it is close to Lorentzian) whose integrated intensity is unity. In the initial stages of this work we examined optimally doped (y=0.93) crystals having three different concentrations of Gd ions; x≃ 0.5%, x≃ 1%, and x≃ 3%. From these measurements, we were able to conclude that the width of the Lorentzian-shaped ESR peaks (δf = 0.35 GHz for x= 1%) scaled approximately linearly with the nominal Gd concentration x, but with a substantial x=0 inter- cept of about 0.30 GHz. Although we did not perform the detailed EPMA analysis to measure x of the nomi- nally 0.5% and 3% samples, it seems clear that at x= 1% there is a dominant contribution to the broadening that is concentration independent. Since a dilute spin-spin interaction is expected to provide a relaxation rate that is linearly proportional to the concentration, 25 our re- sults suggest that some other process is responsible for much of the line broadening.

The Gd atom has the electron configu- ration of [Xe]4f 7 5d 1 6s 2 and ionization number of three in Gd x Y 1−x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6+y. This implies that the outer shell of the ion remains exactly half filled (seven f elec- trons in fourteen states) and the system behaves like a 7/2 spin with no mixing with other S + L multiplets due to Hund's rule. The construction of an effective Hamiltonian for a spin system is based on the expan- sion of the crystal field around the magnetic ion in terms of Stevens operators. These are the operator analogues of the spherical harmonics and are functions ofŜ,Ŝ z andŜ ± , given, for example, by Abragam and Bleaney. Due to the lattice symmetries and the finite spin of the magnetic ion, the expansion reduces to a finite sum of operators H = p,q B p q O p q where the B p q are numerical coefficients called the crystal field parameters. The high- est order of Stevens operator O p q allowed for a spin of 7/2 in a crystal field is 6 since the matrix elements of the Stevens operators between two spin states are zero unless p ≤ 2S. The order is restricted to even values by the required time reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the ab-plane anisotropy is so small that for most purposes one can assume π/2 rotation symmetry about theĉ-axis; orthorhombicity is most significant in the overdoped samples.

The spin 7/2 system discussed herein has four dou- bly degenerate energy levels with four eigenstates that are roughly the ±S z eigenstates of the S z operator. The three allowed ESR transitions correspond to S z → S z ±1. Small off-diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian, such as the O 2 q and O 4 q , induce small level mixing that allow the oth- erwise forbidden transitions corresponding to ±5/2 → ±1/2, ±7/2 → ±1/2 and ±7/2 → ±3/2 to occur, al- beit with relatively low intensities. The resulting energy levels for different CF Hamiltonians are shown in Fig. . Due to the oxygen ordering in chains, which we discuss in detail in the next section, most samples have more than one inequivalent site for the Gd ions. Therefore, two or three sets of CF parameters are needed to fit the spectrum. Following Jánossy et al., we label the spectra corresponding to a particular site by a band index using the notation shown in Fig. .","0"

As a final step, a multiplica-tive factor representing the effective number of spins that have participated in the ESR process is then used to scale the overall amplitude of the model spectrum to match the measured data.

However, the chains are far from the Gd sites and this effect can be treated as a perturbation, leading to line broaden- ing or line splitting. Here we will consider line split- ting associated with distinct Gd environments and sim- ply handle the line width as a parameter in a Lorentzian fit. Different types of Gd sites are encountered because hole doping in this system is controlled by manipulating the oxygen content and ordering of the CuO y chains in Gd x Y 1−x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6+y . The oxygen content is set by an- nealing in controlled oxygen partial pressure at high tem- peratures and then the oxygen ions tend to organize into lengths of CuO chain fragments which are able to pro- mote holes to the CuO 2 planes. The strong tendency to form chain fragments means that there are 7 prob- able Gd environments corresponding to anything from 0 to 4 nearest neighbor chains. These different crystal- lographic environments have been identified in ESR ex- periments on magnetically aligned Gd x Y 1−x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6+y powders and are illustrated in .","0"

In the case of full oxygen doping, the CuO chains are nearly completely full with every Gd ion having four nearest neighbor chains. This results in the simplest of the spectra observed in the five crystals studied. It involves one primary set of CF parameters, denoted the G-band by Jánossey et al., and generates three dominant ESR transitions. A secondary contribu- tion of much lower intensity is also present in these mea- surements, resulting from a configuration where one of the four chains is missing oxygen, denoted the F-band. In the overdoped sample, the largest transition (7/2 → 5/2) of this latter band is barely discernable, but as the oxygen concentration is reduced to optimal doping, the intensity of the F-band builds, as seen in .","0"
"3047","P069184513-CC","25","At lower doping, the next best-ordered phase occurs near y ≈ 0.5, where the chains form an ortho-II struc- ture of alternating full and empty chains. Other ordered phases are: ortho-III with FFE (full, full, empty) chains and ortho-VIII with FFEFFEFE chains. In each of these phases there is more than one possible chain configura- tion around the Gd ions. Having detailed spectra at each doping allows us to identify the different bands and fit each spectrum with a set of crystal field parameters for each band. The fitted χ ′′ spectra are shown in Fig. . In each spectrum, the relative intensities of the different bands is a measure of the relative number of Gd ions in each configuration. This information can be used as a measure of the amount of oxygen in the sample: where n is the number of full nearest neighbor CuO chains in the band and I n is the observed relative inten- sity of the line associated with a particular band. The oxygen content is given by 6 + y. The ESR measured oxygen content versus the chemically measured content is presented in Fig. . Note that the ESR points consis- tently underestimate the amount of oxygen in the crys- tals. This is likely due to the inefficiency of isolated oxy- gens in empty chains in promoting a hole into the CuO 2 planes. The above oxygen content analysis assumes max- imal length of chains, i.e. all chains are either full or missing with no isolated oxygens or vacancies. Since the Gd ions are likely to be sensing the presence of chains through their influence on the charge distribution on the much nearer CuO 2 planes, an isolated oxygen ion hardly affects the crystal field environment since it does not pro- mote a hole into the planes. Thus a Gd ion near an iso- lated oxygen in an otherwise empty chain will experience the crystal field of an empty chain. This will lead to an underestimate of the oxygen content, but will not affect the overall counting of Gd ions. It is also interesting to note that the ESR analysis pro- vides a good measure of the chain disorder. For exam- ple, perfect three dimensional ortho-II ordering should produce only one band, corresponding to two full chains, the D-band. However, our ortho-II spectrum displays two additional bands (the B-and F-bands) resulting from imperfections in the ortho-II ordering. These de- viations can be interpreted as ortho-II phase boundaries. Our ortho-III and ortho-VIII spectra are consistent with long range ortho-III and ortho-VIII order along the ab plane but random stacking along theĉ-direction.","0"

The error estimates account for uncertainties arising from measurements of the sample dimensions, calibration of the microwave ab- sorption experiment and the estimation of the ESR fit parameters.

We have shown that our crystal field parameters agree very well with those obtained by previous authors using the completely differ- ent method of high field ESR on powdered samples. Our results also support the conclusions of the same work which found that isolated oxygens in vacant chains do not influence the CF configuration around the magnetic ion and therefore cannot be distinguished from a vacant chain via ESR spectroscopy. This is in accord with the fact that isolated oxygens do not promote holes from the copper-oxygen planes. The principal result of this work is a set of new values for the penetration depth in all three crystal- lographic directions for three oxygen-ordered phases of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y which are summarized in Table . Theĉ- axis penetration depth is large and increases very rapidly with decreasing doping, as observed previously in in- frared measurements of λ c by Homes et al. The in-plane measurements are in accord with the results of Sonier et al. who performed µSR measurements on mosaics of high-purity, detwinned single crystals at two other oxy- gen dopings. The muon measurements are unable to di- rectly determine anisotropies, but they compare well with the geometric mean of the ab-plane values reported here. A sample of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.60 with T c = 59 K was found to have λ ab = 170 nm, 30 very close to the geometric mean √ λ a λ b = 168±26 nm of the T c = 56 K sample studied here. An optimally doped sample of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.95 with T c = 93 K had λ ab = 112 nm, 4 which lies between the means of the T c = 75 K sample (125±12 nm) and the overdoped T c = 89 K sample (91±6 nm) studied here. The agreement reflects the particular care taken in these µSR measurements to cover a wide range of applied mag- netic fields in order to ascertain the low field limiting values and thus minimize the non-linear, non-local, and other effects that can arise in the vortex state. It must also be noted that the µSR measurements hinge on a detailed model of the vortex lattice that provides a fit to the field distribution detected by the muons.","1"

The origin of this discrepancy is not clear, but might be due to assumptions made in the analysis of the powder data or problems with the sur- faces of grains embedded in epoxy. Our absolute values of λ a and λ b are also smaller than those obtained by far infrared measurements near optimal doping 11 (λ a =160 nm, λ b =100nm). However, the infrared measurements did point out the importance of the in-plane anisotropy in these materials, an anisotropy that becomes very large in the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.99 sample studied here. This anisotropy has been attributed to the presence of a nearly one- dimensional Fermi sheet derived mainly from the bands associated with the CuO chains.

However, the basic picture of chain- driven anisotropy is supported by our new microwave measurements, which also show substantial anisotropy in the ortho-II ordered sample, but rather less in the ortho-III sample, a sensible trend since the ortho-III ordering is much poorer, leading to more fragmented chains. Much of the work on the doping-dependence of λ ab has relied on muon spin relaxation measurements on poly- crystalline samples. In these measurements, the field in- homogeneity in the vortex state gives rise to dephasing of the precessing spins of implanted muons. A Gaussian fit is often used to extract a relaxation rate σ which is deemed proportional to 1/λ 2 . As long as the material is nearly two dimensional, the constant of proportionality can be calculated to be σ = 7.09×10 4 λ −2 , with σ in µs −1 and λ in nm. In the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y system, this very simple treatment of muon data gives values of λ ab that are typically 20% or more larger than the single crystal data reported here.

The data do not support a case for scaling of Tc ∝ 1/λ 2 a in this doping range above Tc = 56 K. superfluid phase stiffness proportional to T c on the under- doped side of the cuprate phase diagram, is not supported by the new data presented here, at least for T c ≥ 56 K. The measurements on YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.993 , which is slightly past optimal doping, are certainly up in the ""plateau"" regime for this material and would not be expected to follow T c ∝ 1/λ 2 . However, even for the lower two dop- ings with T c = 56 K and T c = 75 K theâ-axis phase stiffness, which avoids contributions associated with the CuO chains, is still far from a relationship of the form T c ∝ 1/λ 2 a . The plot instead suggests a sublinear depen- dence of T c on 1/λ 2 a , since T c must fall to zero when 1/λ 2 does. Further data at low doping will be needed to clarify the relationship over the entire doping range. Interest- ingly, the latest muon spin relaxation studies by Tallon et al. also suggest a sublinear relationship, although the values of λ in that study are significantly larger than the single crystal data presented here. In the past, T c ∝ 1/λ 2 has been seen as evidence that phase fluctuations play a central role in setting T c on the underdoped side of the cuprate phase diagram. Indeed, the relatively low values of phase stiffness in the cuprates, plus the ob- servation of critical fluctuations near the superconduct- ing transistion, do indicate that phase fluctuations play a role in determining T c . However, the deviation from a linear relationship seen in Fig. suggests that other factors must also contribute to the critical temper- ature. The obvious candidate is thermal excitation of nodal quasiparticles, which give rise to the linear temperature dependence of λ(T ) and rapidly deplete the superfluid density as temperature rises. However, the central puzzle regarding the correlation between super- fluid density and T c still remains in such a scenario. As the doping decreases, the zero temperature value of the superfluid density becomes much smaller, so that it be- comes easy for quasiparticle excitations, in addition to fluctuations, to drive the material normal at a lower T c. The mystery still lies in understanding why the superfluid density becomes so small with decreasing hole doping.","0"

RCoO 3 (R=Y and various rare earth elements) and other related systems with the perovskite structure are examples of such systems. In such systems, the electron occupation of the lower t 2g and higher e g bands of Co ions changes in a rather significant way when the temperature T is changed or other structural parameters are changed. Due to the existence of the strong Hund coupling between these electrons in different bands, the double exchange type coupling becomes effective with increasing number of electrons excited to the e g band.

"3073","P070052502-CC","5","A powder sample of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O was synthesized from Na 0.75 CoO 2 as described in ref. and confirmed to be the single phase by X-ray diffraction measurements. The lattice parameters a and c are 2.8245 and 19.7101 Å, respectively. The uniform magnetic susceptibility χ was measured using a SQUID magnetometer with magnetic fields H= 5 Oe and 1 T. The data for H= 5 Oe are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of T, where the onset of the superconductivity is found at T ~4.5 K. The magnitudes of diamagnetic signals taken at T =2.0 K under the conditions of zero-field cooling and field cooling correspond to the volume fractions of ~24% and ~6%, respectively. These values are rather large for the powder sample with two-dimensional nature and therefore exclude the possibility that the superconductivity is filamentary. The T 1 of Co nuclei was measured by detecting nuclear magnetization after applying an inversion pulse in the frequency region around 3ν Q (the 5/2→7/2 transition), ν Q being the electrical quadrupolar frequency (~4.2 MHz at 4.23 K). This value of ν Q is consistent with the one estimated from the 59 Co NMR spectra of this sample. The nuclear magnetization m measured as a function of time t elapsed after the inversion pulse, was analyzed under the assumption that there exist two components with shorter and longer relaxation times, T 1short and T 1long , respectively. The following theoretical equation with the number fraction c of nuclear spins which have a shorter relaxation time T 1short , was used. A typical example of the fittings to the observed m-t curves is shown in the inset of Fig. . The c values are found to be ~(0.96-0.98). T 1long is of the order of 1 s and the origin of this longer relaxation time may be due to the existence of a small amount of impurity phase(s). Because T 1short is smaller than T 1long /10 even in the lowest temperature region, both kinds of T 1 can be reliably estimated. Hereafter, T 1 denotes the relaxation time T 1short corresponding to the main phase.","1"

In the normal state, the relation 1/T 1 T ≅ 13 s -1 K -1 holds approximately down to T c . This nearly T-independent behavior of 1/T 1 T is expected for conventional metallic systems and should be contrasted with the rather significant T-dependent behavior of the uniform susceptibility χ observed for the same sample as was used in the NQR measurements (see the data of χ shown in Fig. ). This difference of the T-dependences between 1/T 1 T and χ of the sample Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O indicates that the T-dependent part of χ is not intrinsic to Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O. In the superconducting state, 1/T 1 T increases just below T c and then decreases with decreasing T. The maximum is at ~0.8T c . It is obvious that the small but clear coherence peak exists just below T c . It indicates that a finite energy gap exists throughout the Fermi surface, which stands in clear contrast to the point node gap observed in high-T c copper oxides.","0"

To get a clue for answering these questions, we compare the results with those of superconductors with magnetic impurities. La 3 Al is considered to have a superconducting gap with s-wave symmetry. For La 3-x Gd x Al obtained by doping of magnetic Gd atoms, T c decreases to 0.6T c (x=0) for x=0.02. For the sample, the 1/T 1 -T curve of 27 Al exhibits the coherence peak just below T c . 1/T 1 gradually decreases as T decreases, where it has been considered that due to effects of the Gd magnetic moments, the nuclear spin relaxation rate does not exhib it an exponential-type decay at low temperatures. The similarity of the behaviors of 1/T 1 of the present system to those observed for La 3-x Gd x Al seems to indicate that the present system has an s-wave type energy gap and that exponential-type dependence of 1/T 1 on 1/T cannot be observed because of the effects of a very small amount of magnetic moments which may exist in the sample.

In Fig. 5, the relaxation rate of Na 0.75 CoO 2 is shown in the form of 1/T 1 T -T, together with that of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O, where the relation 1/ 59 T 1 T ≅ a+b/T (a ~3/K/s and b ~21/s) holds for Na 0.75 CoO 2 . As for the Knight shift, the isotropic part K iso of Na x CoO 2 (x=0.5 ~0.75) exhibits very weak T-dependence and does not follow the T dependence of χ, while the anisotropic part follows the T dependence of χ. 9) As was discussed in detail in ref. 9, these results indicate that the electron system of Na 0.75 CoO 2 is essentially itinerant and the b/T term can be considered to be the contribution from the Co sites around the localized Co moments, which are probably induced by lattice imperfections within the CoO 2 layers. The susceptibility corresponding to these itinerant electrons is deduced by subtracting the Curie term as shown by the chain line in Fig. 3. For Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O, the susceptibility of the itinerant electrons is similarly deduced and shown by the broken line in Fig. 3. The ratios of the susceptibilities of these itinerant electron systems of Na 0.75 CoO 2 and Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O and the T-independent parts of 1/ 59 T 1 T are both about 1 : 4. Since 1/T 1 T depends on the square of the density of states N(ε F ) at the Fermi level, the equal ratios obtained for the susceptibilities and for 1/ 59 T 1 T cannot be explained if the effects of electron correlation are not considered. The results should be considered to indicate that the metallic state of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O is closer to a ferromagnetic phase than that of Na 0.75 CoO 2 . (As was reported in ref. 10, Na x CoO 2 itself is located in the proximity of a ferromagnetic phase.)  The present results indicate that the superconductivity of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O appears near a ferromagnetic phase and has s-wave symmetry. We find, in 1/T 1 T of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O, a component proportional to 1/T (see Figs. ). It may be a contribution from localized moments in the sample as in the case of Na 0.75 CoO 2 . Although the magnitude of the component is smaller than that observed for Na 0.75 CoO 2, the rate of decrease of 1/T 1 T with decreasing T becomes larger in the temperature region well below T c , when the component proportional to 1/T is subtracted from the observed values.","0"
"3079","P070052502-CC","11","The experimental findings stated above present a rather severe restriction on the mechanism of the superconductivity. The existence of the coherence peak or the possible s-wave symmetry is, naively speaking, considered to be against the mechanisms predicting the d-wave or p-wave symmetry of the order parameter, though fully gapped order parameters are predicted even for the d-wave symmetry (x 2 -y 2 +ixy). The superconductivity predicted by Sano and Ono, who have studied strongly correlated electrons in two energetically separated bands and considered the Hund coupling between the electrons in these different bands, may be a candidate for the relevant mechanism. The present result that Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O is located near a ferromagnetic phase also suggests the relevance of this mechanism, because their calculations predict the occurrence of superconductivity in the proximate region to a ferromagnetic phase.

"3088","P071100502-CC","2","One of the most important unresolved problems in high-transition temperature (high-T c ) superconductors is the determination of the microscopic state when charge carriers, either holes or electrons, are introduced to the CuO 2 planes of their insulating long-range antiferromagnetically ordered parent compounds . One school of thought suggests that the doped charge carriers segregate into inhomogeneous patterns, such as stripes, to allow the antiferromagnetic (AF) regions to survive . In this picture, the observed quasi two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate spin density wave (SDW) in hole-doped high-T c superconductors, such as La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 (3) and La 2 CuO 4+δ (4), is due to remnants of the AF insulating phase that compete with superconductivity (SC) . Alternatively, carrier doping into the CuO 2 planes may evolve the system through a quantum phase transition (QPT) between competing ordered and disordered phases . While much is unknown about these competing phases and their relationship to SC, the presence of such a QPT has been reported in both hole-doped and electron- doped (12) materials.","0"

Specifically, we find that when SC first appears in PLCCO with increasing doping, a quasi-2D commensurate SDW modulation is also induced, and both coexist with the three-dimensional (3D) AF state. The Néel temperature (T N ) of both the 2D and 3D AF phases decreases linearly with increasing T c and vanishes when optimal SC is achieved . Combined with earlier reports , our discovery establishes that the quasi-2D SDW modulation and its associated electronic inhomogeneity are general features of charge-carrier-doped copper oxides. Such microscopic heterogeneity naturally results from the competition of different order parameters near a QPT. Traditionally, the transition from AF to SC in copper oxides is achieved by chemical doping, which also introduces additional complications such as structural and/or chemical disorder that may mask the nature of the transition . We choose to study this transition in electron-doped PLCCO because, as-grown, these materials are nonsuperconducting (NSC) AF insulators and SC can be achieved by only annealing the samples with minor oxygen modification that changes the charge carrier density . While recent neutron scattering experiments on superconducting Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 4 (NCCO) show a drastic suppression of the static 3D AF order, how SC is established is unknown in part because the magnetic nature of the Nd 3+ in NCCO complicates the interpretation of the data .

However, the drastic decrease in 3D transition to long range magnetic order (T N decreasing from 186 K for NSC to 40 K for T c = 21 K sample) combined with relatively sharp magnetic transition [as in hole-doped La 2 CuO 4 demonstrates that this is not the case. The relatively broad SC transition is then a consequence of an intrinsic electronic inhomogeneity occurring on a length scale longer than the (short) SC coherence length. While neutrons are a bulk probe and cannot determine how SC coexists with the AF phases at zero-field, magnetic field experiments show that the AF phase competes directly with SC .

On the other hand, the parallel shift of the superconducting transition curve is observed for x = 0.11 and 0.12 and for x = 0.10 above 9 T. The parallel shift has also been observed in LNSCO with x = 0.15 (Ref. ) and LSCO with x = 0.12 (Ref. ) where the static stripe order of charges and/or spins is formed at low temperatures. These suggest that both the superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation and the static stripe order are realized in one sample. Here, it is an important is- sue whether the superconducting region and the static stripe-ordered one coexist microscopically or are sepa- rated macroscopically. From the neutron scattering mea- surements in La 1.875 Ba 0.125−x Sr x CuO 4 , the static stripe order has been suggested to compete with the supercon- ductivity. Moreover, from the muon-spin-relaxation measurements in La 2−x Sr x Cu 1−y Zn y O 4 around x = 1/8, it has been suggested that the superconductivity is de- stroyed in a region where frequencies of the dynamical stripe fluctuations are lower than ∼ 10 11 Hz.

"3120","P071104516-CC","15","Next, we discuss the relation between the change of the normal-state behavior of ρ ab in magnetic fields and the field-induced stripe order. Considering the results of the elastic neutron scattering measurements mentioned in Sec. I, the negligibly small increase of ρ ab below T d2 with increasing field for x = 0.11 and 0.12 seems to indicate that the stripe order is nearly perfectly stabilized in zero field and is insensitive to the applied field. As for x = 0.10, the marked increase of ρ ab below T d2 with increasing field reminds us some possible origins. The first is the normal-state magnetoresistance. However, this is not applicable, because the normal-state magnetoresistance is usually as small as an order of 1 % at 15 T, as in the case of x = 0.11 and 0.12. The sec- ond is the suppression of the superconducting fluctuation by the applied field. The positive magnetoresistance ap- pears even at temperatures just below T d2 far from T onset c in high fields. On the other hand, reports on the Nernst effect in LSCO have suggested that the vortex state sur- vives even at higher temperatures far above T c , meaning that the superconducting fluctuation exists even at high temperatures. Therefore, this possible origin can- not be excluded and further measurements are needed to conclude. Nevertheless, it appears that this is not a can- didate, because the large positive magnetoresistance is observed only for x = 0.10 and not for x = 0.11 nor 0.12.

The localization behavior of ρ ab becomes marked with increasing field and appears to approach the behavior of LNSCO with x = 0.12 where the stripe order is perfectly stabilized. In the long run, the most probable origin is that the charge-spin stripe order is stabilized by the applied field in x = 0.10.

To be more conclusive, the neutron scattering measurements in magnetic fields are under way.","0"

So far, it has been clarified in the underdoped LSCO and BSLCO that ρ ab in the normal state shows the ln(1/T ) dependence at low temperatures in magnetic fields, suggesting that the ln(1/T ) dependence is a common feature of the underdoped high-T c cuprates. To check this suggestion, ρ ab 's of LBCO with x = 0.10, 0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12 at 15 T are plotted ver- sus lnT , as shown in . Below ∼ 20 K, it is found that ρ ab in the normal state is proportional to ln(1/T ) in each x, though ρ ab deviates downward from ln(1/T ) at low temperatures because of the superconducting transi- tion for x = 0.10 and 0.11. The small deviation below 3 K for x = 0.12 is irrelevant to the superconducting tran- sition, because ρ ab is independent of the field strength for H ≥ 11 T, as seen in . The slope of the ln(1/T ) dependence is found to increase with increas- ing x, indicating that the localization of holes becomes strong with increasing x toward x = 1/8 at 15 T. The ln(1/T ) dependence is known to be characteristic of the weak localization and the electron-electron interaction in the two-dimensional Anderson-localized state where the in-plane electrical conductivity σ ab actually changes in proportion to ln(1/T ) even in magnetic fields. For x = 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12, however, σ ab does not show the ln(1/T ) dependence below T d2 , as in the case of the un- derdoped LSCO. Although the true origin of the ln(1/T ) dependence of ρ ab is not clear, the localization of holes with the ln(1/T ) dependence observed widely in the underdoped high-T c cuprates is robust even in the stripe-ordered state of LBCO and LNSCO. V. SUMMARY It has been found that the superconducting transition curve shows the parallel shift by the application of mag- netic field in LBCO with x = 0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12 where the charge-spin stripe order is formed at low temperatures. These suggest that both the su- perconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation and the static stripe order are realized in one sample for x = 0.11 and 0.12. For LBCO with x = 0.10, the broad- ening in low fields changes to the parallel shift in high fields above 9 T. Moreover, ρ ab in the normal state be- low T d2 increases with increasing field up to 15 T. It is possible that these pronounced features of x = 0.10 are understood in terms of the field-induced stabilization of the charge stripe order. The ρ ab in the normal state at low temperatures has been found to be proportional to ln(1/T ) for x = 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12, suggesting the lo- calization of holes with the ln(1/T ) dependence of ρ ab which is robust even in the stripe-ordered state of LBCO and LNSCO.","0"

The bulk modulus of La 2 C 3 at 30 GPa is about 250 GPa. This value would be an upper limit for the ambient-pressure bulk modulus B 0 of Y 2 C 3 ; it is much lower than the calculated one (B 0 = 363 GPa) reported in Ref. . At ambient conditions, the volume per La 2 C 3 formula unit (85.68Å 3 ) is smaller than that of the constituents La metal and carbon in the diamond modification (La metal 37.5Å 3 /La, diamond 5.67Å 3 /C, 2 × 37.5 + 3 × 5.67 = 92.0Å 3 ). So, the P ∆V term in the free energy difference favors the formation of the compound under pressure. However, because of the large compressibility of La metal [B 0 (La) ≈ 25 GPa, Ref. 21], the P ∆V term changes sign at about 5 GPa . Hence, La 2 C 3 is not necessarily a thermodynamically stable phase at all pressures cov- ered in our experiment. A high-temperature experiment performed above 5 GPa may result in decomposition or, perhaps, the formation of a metal-rich carbide.","0"

The dicarbide anions are centered at the interstitial 12a site (3/8, 0, 1/4) and ori- ented along the 4 axes of the bisphenoids ) whose shape depends on the positional parameter x.

This means that the coordination polyhedron around C 2 is compressed isotropically, and there is no change in the second neighbor coordination. Actually, at ambient pres- sure the x parameters of all cubic rare earth and actinide sequicarbides cluster around 0.051 with a quite narrow spread of ±0.002. The arrangement of metal ions in La 2 C 3 is similar to that of the 'cI16' (16-atom body centered cubic) phase of high-pressure Li which can be interpreted as a 2×2×2 su- perstructure of bcc. In Li-cI16 a pseudo-gap is formed, involving a lowering of the density of states N (E F ) at the Fermi level, which leads to a decrease of the total energy relative to any of the common high-symmetry phases of elemental metals. Despite the pseudo-gap formation, the cI16 phase of Li is a superconductor with T c > 10 K (see Ref. and literature cited therein). As for La 2 C 3 , the Fermi level is calculated to also fall into a local mini- mum of the DOS. This is qualitatively similar to what is reported for Y 2 C 3 . 4,5 It is not clear whether the forma- tion of a local DOS minimum in the sesquicarbides is a consequence of the structural distortion of the metal sub- lattice away from bcc. In any case, the states in the DOS minimum of Y 2 C 3 show a strong coupling to 'symmetry- preserving' metal atom displacements, i.e. a change in the x parameter. For La 2 C 3 , a C-C distance of 1.236Å is given in Ref. . A slightly larger distance, about 1.29Å (Ref. 8), appears more plausible. Unfortunately, our experiments do not provide any information on the pressure depen- dence of the C-C distance. This distance will correlate","1"

The disappearance of superconductivity in Li 1+x Ti 2-x O 4 for x > 0.15 was concluded to be due to grain boundary effects. It has attracted a lot of attentions due to at least having the following physical significances related to the present studies. For example, it is the only spinel oxide superconductor (T c ~1 2 K) so far to our knowledge. Also, it is the rare oxide superconductor showing a sharp superconducting anomaly in specific heat (C) in contrast to an unpronounced one in polycrystalline BaPb 1-x Bi x O 3 with a comparable T c ~1 2 K. The upper critical field H c2 (0) of LiTi 2 O 4 reported by several groups varied from 2 to 32.8 T. Issues like whether the superconductivity in LiTi 2 O 4 can be well explained in the framework of BCS theory based upon the electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions and the role of the electron-electron (e-e) interactions have not been totally clearified. Some theoretical predictions showed that LiTi 2 O 4 was a strong coupling BCS superconductor while the low temperature specific heat and magnetic susceptibility data implied for the conditions for weak coupling d-band superconductivity. Furthermore, there has been a very recently revived debate on Anderson's resonating valance bond (RVB)-type ground state as the possible origin of superconductivity in cuprates. Since the Ti sub-lattice of the spinel structure allows a high degree of frustration, RVB ground state is probable in the LiTi 2 O 4 spinel. In fact, the specific heat (C), a thermodynamic bulk property unlike resistivity and magnetization, of LiTi 2 O 4 has been elaborately studied by some groups in the absence of magnetic field (H). Though some of the derived parameters (listed in Table) agree quite well with each other, some of them differ significantly and lead to incompatible descriptions for the nature of superconductivity. These controversies especially warrant a comprehensive revisit of superconductivity in LiTi 2 O 4 . In addition, the recent intensive investigations of its isostructural compounds LiMn 2 O 4 (Ref. ) and LiV 2 O 4 (Refs. 4 and 16) exhibiting respectively high-voltage electrolyte and 3d heavy fermion behavior also tempt us to study the crucial role of 3d metals in the spinel oxide structure. In particular, it is interesting to study the evolution from 3d superconductivity to 3d heavy fermion in Li(Ti 1-x V x ) 2 O 4 . In this report, we thus provide the detailed magnetic field (up to 8 T) dependence of the low temperature specific heat on LiTi 2 O 4, which has never been reported in the literature earlier and is crucial to the determination of superconducting properties, to explore its pairing mechanism of superconductivity.","1"
"3150","P070054519-CC","4","The preparation and characterization of polycrystalline LiTi 2 O 4 used in this low temperature specific heat measurement were described elsewhere. Highly pure Li 2 CO 3 and TiO 2 were mixed in an appropriate ratio, calcined in a quartz tube under pure oxygen atmosphere for 20 h at 750 0 C leading to the formation of Li 2 Ti 2 O 5 . Then it was mixed with a proper amount of Ti 2 O 3 , grounded thoroughly, pressed into pellets, and sintered at 880 0 C for 24 h under a dynamic vacuum with pressure less than 10 -4 torr. Basically, to obtain a pure LiTi 2 O 4 phase, one needs to add ~15% more of Li than nominal composition due to its volatility. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data obtained by SIEMENS D5000 diffractometer using CuKα radiation showed that Li 1+x Ti 2 O 4 exhibited Ti 2 O 3 impurity phase for x=0 and pure LiTi 2 O 4 phase was obtained for 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.15 (Ref. ) which was used for this specific heat measurement.

The scatter of data in different magnetic fields was within 3%. T c (~11.4 K) obtained from specific heat data is consistent with that measured by resistivity on the same sample.","1"

The normal state specific heat in the absence of magnetic field, is extracted from H = 8 T data between 8 and 20 K, where γ n T is the electronic term due to free charge carriers and C lattice (T) = βT 3 + αT 5 is representing the phonon contribution which is assumed to be independent of magnetic field. It is found that γ n = 19.15 ± 0.20 (mJ/mol K 2 ), β = 0.048 ± 0.002 (mJ/mol K 4 ), and α = 0.00012 ± 0.00005 (mJ/mol K 6 ) give the best fitting (solid line in Fig. ) to the experimental data. It is noted that if we take C lattice (T) = βT 3 + αT 5 + DT , the best fit occurs at negative value of D ( = -2.8±0.5 x 10 -7 mJ/mol K 8 ) which is unreasonable. On the other hand, C lattice (T)= βT 3 gives much higher RMS value compared to C lattice (T) = βT 3 + αT . The enhancement of γ n by the electron-phonon interaction is given by 19 where N(E F ) is the band structure density of states at the Fermi level, k B is the Boltzman constant, and λ is the electron-phonon interaction constant. Taking λ = 0.65 as obtained from low temperature specific heat data (discussed later), the calculated value of N(E F ) for the present sample is ~ 0.70 states/eV atom. This is lower than that (~ 0.97 states/eV atom) perceived by McCallum et al. from susceptibility data which would not satisfy the transition temperature from McMillan equation. However, the authors 2 indicated that the reduction of N(E F ) by 15% (orbital contribution and/or exchange enhancement to total susceptibility) would explain it. The reduced N(E F ) is in close agreement with the present investigation. The Debye temperature Θ D = 657 ±33 K is derived by using the relation where n is the number of atoms per formula unit and takes 7 for LiTi 2 O 4 . This is somewhat higher than those experimentally obtained and theoretically predicted values (~575 K) but closer to those (685-700 K) reported by the group of D. C. Johnston. The values of γ n , N(E F ), and Θ D are listed in Table along with some other parameters for comparison with reported results. The characteristics of superconducting phase transition in LiTi 2 O 4 can be analyzed using the relation The resultant äC(T)/T vs. T is shown in Fig. , where the inset illustrates the conservation of entropy S = ∫ c T dT T C 0 δ around the transition. This conservation of entropy is essential for a second order, such as superconducting-normal, phase transition. In this case, fail to include αT 5 term in Eq. will not totally satisfy this requirement. In fact, this requirement may be used to testify the justification of the values of γ n and Θ D . The dimensionless specific-heat jump at T c is äC/γ n T c = 1.78 as indicated in Fig. which is greater than the typical weak coupling value (~1.43). Thus äC(T)/T is well fitted to the BCS model as shown in Fig. by the solid line with a little higher 2∆/k B T c (~ 4.0), where ∆ is the superconducting energy gap instead of the weak coupling value (~ 3.52). This value of 2∆/k B T c ~ 4 (i.e. ∆ = 1.97 meV) is consistent with 3.8 in the Ref. 3] and the reference therein where the tunneling experiments yielded the value of 4.0. Consequently, the superconductivity in LiTi 2 O 4 can be explained by the moderate coupling BCS framework though the early low temperature specific heat and theoretical calculations respectively indicated weak and strong coupling.","0"

Clearly, γ(H) follows an H dependence which is very close to be linear, especially for H ≥ 1 T. The slight deviation in low H could be due to the vortex-vortex interaction as discussed in Refs. 22 and 23. The value of H c2 (T = 0) estimated from Fig. using linear extrapolation of ã(H) for H ≥ 1 T to ã n ~19.15 mJ/mol K 2 is H c2 (T = 0) = 11.0 ± 0.5 T.

Therefore, the above analysis using Eq. in the dirty limit regime is self-consistent. In addition, the issue of the mass renormalization factor in the previous literature was actually unsolved. A large λ tot = 1.8 was inferred implying a strong electron-electron interaction with unknown origin. One can express λ tot = λ+λ e , where λ is the electron-phonon coupling constant and λ e manifests the interactions due to the possible spin fluctuations and other electron-electron interactions. If we rewrite Eq.

Therefore, the resultant λ e = λ tot -λ =1.53 -0.65=0.88 suggests a moderate electron-electron interaction in LiTi 2 O 4 , and is more consistent with a Stoner enhancement factor (1-S) -1~2 , which was derived from the magnetic susceptibility χ = µ B 2 N(E F )/(1-S).

One would find that the T c of these superconductors does not strongly correlate with their structure, ã n , N(E F ), Θ D , and the electron-phonon coupling constant ë. It is also evident that the superconductivity of each material occurs at only very narrow transition-metal composition. A small amount of metal substitution or a little off-stoichiometry for transition metal will dramatically suppress the superconductivity.

"3174","P071134526-CC","3","In the high-T c cuprate superconductors, anisotropy has been suggested to play an important role in the super- conducting pairing mechanism and the elevated T c in both experimental and theoretical work . It is surprising therefore to find superconductivity (SC) with T c = 43 K in the optimal electron-doped infinite-layer cuprates Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 (M = La, Gd), which exhibit only a 16% difference between the a and c tetragonal lattice parameters. The structure of Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 is the most basic among all high-T c cuprates, consisting entirely of CuO 2 sheets separated by rare-earth (RE) ions with tetragonal lattice parameters c = 3.41Å and a = 3.95Å. The recent success in producing high-quality polycrystalline samples of the infinite-layer cuprates with no observable impurity phases has en- gendered a renewed interest in these compounds. X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy indicate electron dop- ing, and bulk SC has been verified by powdered mag- netization (M ) measurements and specific heat (C) measurements (data presented later in this work). Sev- eral recent studies of these high purity polycrystalline samples suggest three-dimensional (3D) superconductiv- ity in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 . Scanning tunnel spectroscopy (STS) measurements indicate an unconventional but isotropic s-wave superconducting gap with no pseudogap at zero field. The s-wave symmetry of the gap is also sup- ported by specific heat measurements and Cu-site substi- tution studies,although it may be contradicted by NMR measurements. Kim et al estimated the c-axis coherence length (ξ c ) from a Hao-Clem analysis of the reversible magnetization of grain-aligned poly- crystal, and found that ξ c exceeds the spacing between the CuO 2 planes, indicating 3D superconductivity. On the other hand, they also find significant anisotropy be-tween magnetic fields H ≤ 5 T oriented parallel and per- pendicular to the CuO 2 planes, with an anisotropy ratio γ = ξ c /ξ ab = H ab c2 /H c c2 = 9.3, which is larger than γ = 5 observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ although much smaller than γ = 55 observed in optimally doped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8−δ . It is interesting to note that the only ma- jor crystallographic difference between the a-b and the c directions in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is the presence of oxygen in the a-b plane, which allows coupling of adjacent Cu spins and has been implicated as the cause of antiferro- magntic ordering or spin fluctuations in other members of the high-T c cuprate family, as well as a possible mech- anism for superconducting pairing. The importance of the CuO 2 planes to the SC in Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 is further supported by the fact that Ni substitution on the Cu site rapidly suppresses T c whereas out-of-plane Gd substitu- tion on the Sr site leaves T c unchanged. In this work we determine the upper critical field H c2 and the irreversibility field H irr of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 by means of magnetization and penetration depth measure- ments in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T in order to directly investigate the degree of upper critical field anisotropy and the role of vortex fluctuations. We also present specific heat (C) and magnetization (M ) mea- surements in low DC fields to 6 T as a function of tem- perature (T ) of Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2, confirming the bulk co- existence of Gd paramagnetism (PM) and SC.

High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Los Alamos, NM in a 3 He refrigerator in a 50 T magnet using a compensated coil. The sample consisted of four pieces of polycrystalline Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 with a total mass of 4.8 mg to maximize signal and minimize heating. The irreversibility field H irr was identified from the onset of reversibility in the M (H) loops. The penetration depth of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 was determined by measuring the frequency shift ∆f of a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) resonant tank circuit with the sample contained in one of the component inductors. A ten turn 0.7 mm diameter aluminum coil was tightly wound around the sample with a filling factor of greater than 90%, with the coil axis oriented perpendicular to the pulsed field. To maintain temperature stability, the sample was thermally anchored to a sapphire plate and placed in 3 He exchange gas. Small changes in the resonant frequency can be related to changes in the penetration depth ∆λ by ∆λ = − R 2 rs ∆f f0 , where R is the radius of the coil and r s is the radius of the sample. In our case, R ∼ r s = 0.7 mm and the reference frequency f 0 ∼ 60 MHz such that ∆f = (0.16 MHz/µm)∆λ.","1"
"3177","P071134526-CC","6","The frequency shift ∆f relative to the normal state and the corresponding ∆λ of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 are shown in as a function of H. The inset shows the T -dependence of ∆f in zero magnetic field. The nor- mal state resonant frequency f that is reached with in- creasing field can only be determined for T ≥ 30 K; for lower T the sample remains superconducting to 60 T so ∆f is estimated. The frequency shift of the empty coil has been subtracted from all data. In applied fields, the SC transition is very broad, which can be attributed to the large anisotropy in H c2 of the randomly orientated grains in the polycrystal. By contrast, the SC tran- sition as a function of T at H = 0 is very sharp, in- dicating a high quality sample. Therefore, the onset of diamagnetism with decreasing H in the λ(H) data can be identified with the largest H c2 , H ab c2 for fields in the CuO 2 planes. The onset is defined as H where ∆f > 5 kHz (∆λ > 30 nm), just above the noise of the exper- iment. Different onset criteria have only minor effects on the determination of H ab c2 , as shown in where H ab c2 using an onset criteria of 10 kHz and 20 kHz are shown as open circles and diamonds, respectively. The upper critical field H ab c2 is linear in T up to the H = 60 T maximum of the experiment, and extrapolates to 153 T at zero temperature. (Although if we assume the typ- ical Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg curvature for an or- bitally limited superconductor, 153 T would consti- tute an upper limit for H ab c2 ). The linearly extrapolated value of 153 T is close to the s-wave Pauli paramagnetic limit of H p c2 = ∆ √ 2µB = 159 T, where ∆ = 13 meV has been determined independently from STS data. This raises the possibility of spin-limited superconduc- tivity for H in the plane, which has also been observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ. Determination of the critical fields for H along the c- axis, H c c2 , from these data on noncrystalline samples is more difficult. However, at fields below the onset of dia- magnetism we do observe a significant change in slope of the λ(H) data, indicated as H kink in . The H kink vs T curve is shown in and extrapolates to 12 T at zero temperature. This value of H kink (T = 0) is close to H c c2 = 14 T determined from a Hao-Clem analysis men- tioned previously. [5] We therefore associate H kink with H c c2 . In λ(H) measurements of a noncrystalline sample, a change in slope near H c c2 could be expected since the number of grains in the polycrystal that are supercon- ducting varies with H for H c c2 < H < H ab c2 , whereas for H < H c c2 the entire sample is superconducting, yield- ing different H dependencies of the flux expulsion in these two regions. Our data yield an anisotropy ratio γ = dH ab c2 dT / H c c2 dT ∼ 8, roughly in agreement with γ = 9.3 determined from low field studies. In penetration depth measurements of single crys- talline organic superconductors for H along the conduct- ing planes, a kink below H c2 for fields has been asso- ciated with the vortex melting transition. However, in this work we have determined the vortex dynamics separately by means of magnetization measurements in pulsed fields, and we find a significant difference be- tween the onset of irreversibility in M (H), H irr , and H kink as shown in . Following similar arguments for the λ(H) measurements, we note that H ab irr > H c irr in cuprate superconductors, therefore we assign the on- set of irreversibility for polycrystalline Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 to H ab irr . Although we can't rule out the possibility that H kink might be associated with a vortex phase trans- formation, the fact that H kink (T → 0) saturates, and H kink (T → 0) << H ab c2 (T → 0) indicates that H kink (T ) is unlikely caused by a thermally-induced vortex melt- ing transition for H||ab. Future pulsed-field measure- ments on grain-aligned or epitaxial thin film samples will be necessary to conclusively determine whether H kink (T ) obtained in this work may be identified with H c c2 (T ). The region between H ab irr and H ab c2 in the phase dia- gram in is significantly larger than is observed in other electron-doped high-T c compounds where H c2 typically tracks H irr . It is particularly surpris- ing that H ab irr (T → 0) ∼ 45 T is much smaller than H ab c2 (T → 0) ∼ 150 T. In hole-doped cuprates, a large separation between H irr and H c2 is often observed and is generally referred to as a vortex-liquid phase due to thermally induced fluctuations. The large discrepancy between H ab irr and H ab c2 in e-doped Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 even to T → 0 suggests the presence of field-enhanced SC fluc- tuations in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 . Enhanced SC fluctuations down to very low T may be consistent with a scenario of SC coexisting with a competing order, such as a spin- density wave (SDW) near a quantum critical point. In particular, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations associ- ated with the competing SDW can be enhanced by ex- ternal fields. The conjecture of a competing order in the SC state of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is also consistent with our recent STS studies, where we observe the emergence of a second energy gap with increasing tunnelling current upon the closing of the SC gap. In con- trast to the SC gap, the current-induced gap is not spa- tially uniform probably due to interactions of the SDW with charge disorder. We note that experimental evidence for coexistence of a SDW with cuprate super- conductivity has been found in other high-T c compounds. To further investigate the dimensionality of the super-conductivity, low-field C(T ) and M (T, H) of polycrys- talline Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2 were measured with H up to 6 T and T down to 1.8 K in a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System and a SQUID magne- tometer, respectively. In contrast to in-plane Ni substi- tution on the Cu site, out of plane Gd substitution on the Sr site does not suppress T c . In fact, the Gd ions exhibit local moment paramagnetism (PM) that coexists with SC to low T . shows M (H) at T = 5 K, and zero field/field cooled magnetization curves as a function of T in the inset. The M (H) curve in the main figure can be viewed as a superposition of a SC hysteresis curve and a Brillouin function resulting from the PM of Gd. Further proof for this coexistence is evident in the inset, which shows a large positive magnetization asso- ciated with Gd paramagnetism, but nevertheless signifi- cant hysteresis between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled curves, indicating superconductivity.","0"

The H = 0 data is fit by a T 3 dependence to model the phonon contribution, (the electronic contribution at these temperature can be neglected). For H = 6 T, C(T ) can be fit by the same T 3 dependence as the H = 0 data, plus an additional contribution from the Gd paramag- netic moments, derived from mean field theory assuming the Hund's rule J = 7/2 moment, and one Gd ion for every ten unit cells. The fit is remarkable, considering that there are no fitting parameters.

The in plane upper criti- cal field H ab c2 extrapolates close to the Pauli paramagnetic limit H P c2 = 159 T, suggesting possible spin limiting for this orientation, as has been observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ . There is a large separation between H ab c2 and the irre- versibility field H ab irr , which extends down to T → 0, and is abnormal for electron doped high-T c cuprates. This suggests the existence of field-induced superconducting spin fluctuations perhaps due to a competing SDW. In spite of the significant anisotropy in the upper critical fields, ξ c is longer than the spacing between CuO 2 planes, indicating three-dimensionality of the orbital wave func- tion. The low-field thermodynamic measurements of M (T ) and C(T ) for Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2 polycrystals indi- cate a coexistence of bulk SC with Gd paramagnetism, with the full J = 7/2 Hund's rule moment despite the close proximity of Gd atoms to the CuO 2 planes, and a T c of 43 K in both Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2 and Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2. This can interpreted in terms of a strong confinement of the spin degrees of freedom of the Cooper pairs to the CuO 2 planes, whereas the orbital wave functions over- lap adjacent CuO 2 planes, and exhibit isotropic s-wave symmetry as determined by STS measurements.","1"

Our intuitive explanation as to why all the M-1222 materials (M 5+ ) are SC is discussed in Ref. 4. Assuming that Mo is pentavalent, we may apply the same model to the Mo-1222 materials. In the well-established phase diagram for La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 , the parent La 2 CuO 4 is AFM and insulating and replacing Sr 2+ for La 3+ varies the hole density p. In Mo-1222 (Sr 2+ , Cu 2+ and O 2-), Ce is tetravalent 5 and our Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS) study performed at RT on 151 Eu, shows a singlet with an isomer shift of 0.04(2) mm/s (relative to Eu 2 O 3 ), indicating that the Eu is trivalent. Given that Mo is pentavalent, a straightforward valence count yields a fixed oxygen concentration of 10. Thus, we argue that the MoSr 2 EuCeCu 2 O 10 sample serves as the parent compounds (similar to La 2 CuO 4 ). Hole doping of the Cu-O planes, which results in SC, can be achieved with increasing of the R 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio (R 3+ ions are replaced for Ce 4+ ) and indeed, MoEu 1.5 Ce 0.5 Sr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ is SC. The optimal doping of Ce is now under investigation. (C) Antiferromagnetism in the MoSr 2 R 1.5 Ce 0.5 Cu 2 O 10 (R=Ho-Lu and Y). The ZFC and FC curves of Mo-1222R (R=Y, Er and Tm) measured at 5 -10 Oe, are presented in Fig. 3. One definitely sees the irreversibility and the peaks in the ZFC plots, typical of AFM ordering. We define T N (Table 1) as the merging point of these branches or, alternatively, as the i nflection point in the dχ(T)/dT of the FC curve. Similar behavior was observed for R=Ho and Lu. For R=Yb, no irreversibility is obtained and T N =16 K was defined as the kink observed in both ZFC and FC curves. All M(H) curves measured below and above T N are linear up to 5 T and no hystersis is observed. Above T N , the χ(T) curve for Mo-1222Y follows the CW law, and provides useful information on the Mo valence. Taking into account the existence (of about 5-6%) of the SrMoO 4 phase and by subtracting the Cu contribution (see above) we obtained P eff =1.68 µ B a value which is in good agreement with 1.73 µ B expected for Mo 5+ (4d 1 , S=0.5). Therefore, we argue with high confidence, that the prominent feature shown in , as well as the SC state described above, are related to the Mo 5+ sublattice. This preferable interpretation, which invokes analogy to the Ru-1222 system, means that the Mo layers are AFM ordered at relatively low temperatures (13-26 K).","0"
"3194","P068064507-CC","11","The P eff values for R=Ho-Yb are in good agreement with their calculated R 3+ free ion values. Note the negative θ obtained which is consistent with an AFM order. For R=Tb and Dy, the χ(T) curves have a PM-like behavior down to 5 K. For R= Dy, the small contribution of the Mo AFM signal, (0.2 emu/mol Oe for R=Y see Fig. 5 inset), is probably masked by the high PM susceptibility of Dy 3+ . The P eff value obtained fits well the expected value of Dy 3 . For R=Tb, P eff = 8.7 µ B deduced, is smaller than the 9.72 µ B expected for free ion Tb 3+ , suggesting that Tb has an intermediate valence-state, which also affects its magnetic behavior. This is reminiscent of the exception of the non-SC Tb123, among all other R123 materials. (D) The MoSr 2 Gd 1.5 Ce 0.5 Cu 2 O 10 sample. This sample shows two magnetic transitions at 11 K and at 184 K and positive θ (Fig. 4). The M(H) curves are linear and no hystersis is observed. At 5 K, for H> 3 T a tendency toward PM saturation (of Gd ions) is obtained. No magnetic transition is observed down to 1.8 K (Fig 4 inset). This is in contrast to Gd123, M-1212 (M=Ru and Mo) and Ru-1222 in which Gd is AFM ordered at 2.2-2.6 K. (I) We may suggest that the peak at 11 K is related to the Gd sublattice and the highest transition i s due to the Mo layers. (II) A more preferable interpretation is that both transitions are related to the Mo sublattice, whereas the origin of the second one is not known yet. Our supporting evidence is the fact, that in MoSr 2 GdCeCu 2 O 10 (Gd/Ce=1) both anomalies are absent (Fig. 4), suggesting that the two magnetic transitions are connected to each other. The PM values extracted for MoSr 2 GdCeCu 2 O 10 are:θ= -4.4 K and P eff = 7.85 µ B /Gd which fits well the theoretical value of 7.94 µ B /Gd. At the present moment we cannot explain as to why the R=Gd sample behaves so differently from all the rest of the heavy Mo-1222R compounds. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the behavior of Mo-1222 system is entirely different from Ru 5+ -1222 one. In Mo-1222 (Mo 5+ ), the physical state depends strongly on the ionic radii of the R ionst. For large R ions, the samples are PM ). Once the a lattice parameter is contracted, SC in the CuO 2 planes is induced at T C ~ 20 K. Further contraction of a leads to an AFM order (at T N 13-26 K) in the Mo-O layers and to suppression of SC. The SC and AFM (which compete each other) states depend on the R/Ce ratio and both disappear for R/Ce=1. The magnetic behavior of the Gd sample is different. Neutron diffraction as well as MS on 155 Gd studies, are now being carried out to determine the magnetic structure of this system.","1"

"3202","P072064527-CC","2","Superconductivity is a fundamental quantum phenomenon, which is now widely believed to be explained by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schreiffer (BCS) theory . However, even after the appearance of the theory, continuous discoveries of new superconducting materials with higher transition temperatures (T c ) have made the field attractive owing to the expectations of a new theory as well as new materials having higher T c . Therefore, the discovery of the superconductivity on magnesium diboride (MgB 2 ) has also induced enormous studies to clarify the superconducting (SC) transition mechanism because it has the highest T c among inter metallic superconductors and has even higher T c than some of the cuprate superconductors with locating the T c close to the upper limit predicted by the BCS theory . It is now generally accepted that MgB 2 has a multiple SC gap , originating in the two types of Fermi surface sheets with very different character, which simultaneously plays an important role for the high T c . Theoretically, a possibility of the multiple SC gap was proposed more than 40 years ago in terms of ""two-band superconductivity"". However, further experimental verification is essential for complete understanding of this unique superconductor. Here, we show carbon-substitution dependence of the two gap of MgB 2 with the ""sub-meV"" resolution photoemission spectroscopy (PES). The result clearly shows two gaps and different substitution dependence for the two gaps. These results shed another light on to the two-band superconductivity in MgB 2 , and also suggest a new road to explore the higher T c material. MgB 2 has two layers consisted of boron and magnesium respectively . The first-principles calculations have indicated that MgB 2 is a band metal, where four bands are crossing Fermi level (E F ). Two of them originate in the boron 2p σ orbital with a two-dimensional character, named σ band, and the other two do in the boron 2p π one with a three-dimensional character, named π band. The calculated band structure is consistent with experimental one, e.g. obtained from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy . At this stage, the transition mechanism is explained by the electron-phonon coupling , where the coupling strength depends on the symmetry of the Fermi surface. This scenario, based on the two-band model or, in more detail, k-dependent BCS theory or known as Eliashberg theory , has succeeded in explaining the multiplicity of the SC gap qualitatively and the T c quantitatively.","0"

For this purpose, ultrahigh-resolution photoemission spectroscopy is the best method because it can reveal the multiple SC gap directly, as was reported with PES using a He discharging lamp . Moreover, recent advance in energy resolution of a photoemission spectrometer by using a laser as a photon source has achieved a ""sub-meV"" resolution [15] and provided us new opportunity to do more quantitative and reliable study for the multiple gap and for the role of the interband coupling. Photoemission measurements were performed on a spectrometer built using a Scienta R4000 electron analyzer and a ultra-violet laser (6.994 eV). The energy resolution was set to ~ 0.4 meV. Samples are cooled using a flowing liquid He refrigerator with improved thermal shielding. The pressure of the spectrometer was better than 1 x 10 -10 Torr. during all the measurements. All the photoemission measurements have been done for in-situ fractured surfaces. Temperature-dependent spectral changes were confirmed by cycling temperature across T c.

Compared with the spectrum obtained using a conventional He discharge lump (indicated by a black thin line), the quality of the spectrum was drastically improved and the multiplicity of the SC gap is certain because of the marked increase of the energy resolution. Moreover, no photoemission intensity was observed around E F , directly indicating that MgB 2 is a full gap superconductor. As 5 the x is increased, while the higher binding energy peak shifts clearly, the lower binding energy structure stays nearly the same position. Within the measured x concentrations, the two structures do not merge, indicating that Mg(B 1-x C x ) 2 has two gaps up to x = 7.5 %, consistently with the magnetic torque experiment .

The gap sizes at T = 0 K were determined by an extrapolation from the fitting result using a known BCS temperature dependence of a SC gap . The larger gap, corresponding to the σ band, decreases with increasing x, while the smaller gap, corresponding to the π band, looks independent to x within the fitting error up to x = 7.5 %. Bussmann-Holder and Bianconni calculated the x dependence of the two gaps for Al substituted case , which predicted that the smaller gap increases up to the 20 % substitution. The result is different from the present one. The x dependence of T c shown on by a solid line seems very similar to that of the larger gap in contrast to that of the smaller gap. The similar x dependence of the larger gap and T c means the reduced gap 2∆/k B T c , which is a measure of coupling strength between the SC electron, is independent to x. In the weak coupling limit, this value is 3.52, which is known as the mean field BCS value . In the present case for the larger gap, this value is 4.1, which is surely larger than the BCS value, and it is almost independent to x. This result suggests that electron-phonon coupling of the σ band is strong and also T c, or, in other words, superconductivity is governed by the σ band.","0"

This model contains four parameters (the electron-phonon coupling matrix element) producing the two intraband couplings for the larger and smaller gaps, (λ σσ , λ ππ ), and the two interband couplings between the larger gap and the smaller gap (λ πσ , λ σπ ) after being multiplied by corresponding calculated partial DOS at E F .

We found that this simple model can reproduce the gap sizes for both the gaps at T = 0 and their temperature dependence very well . From , it is clear that the intraband coupling of the σ band decreases while the interband coupling increases with increasing x. The suppression of the λ σσ cannot be explained by the DOS at E F of the σ band alone, since the decrease of the calculated DOS at E F of the σ band due to electron doping is estimated to be, at most, 10 % for x = 7.5% within the rigid band model, much smaller than the 20 % reduction in λ σσ . This suggests that a suppression of the electron-phonon coupling, as discussed from Raman studies , and/or an increase of interband impurity scattering are also responsible for the reduction of T c, though theoretical studies have reported negligible interband impurity scattering effects for the carbon substitution .","0"
"3209","P072064527-CC","9","Thus we made firm experimental confirmation on the two-band superconductivity of MgB 2 . Lastly, we would like to comment on an implication for T c from the two-band model. The multi band model gives T c by D is the Debye temperature and λ is the total coupling constant given by If the interband coupling constants are zero, T c is completely governed by λ σσ . However, if the interband coupling is not zero, T c will always become larger than the case of λ σπ λ πσ = 0. Thus the role of the interband coupling is to make T c higher than the case without interband coupling. In the present case, using obtained parameters, T c is estimated to be pushed up about 5 K by the interband coupling. Normally, it is believed that a larger electron-phonon coupling necessary for an increase of T c gives rise to another transition making the system insulating. In MgB 2 , the existence of the π band may play some role for preventing such an instability occurring at the σ band with the strong electron-phonon coupling and allow σ band to become a strong coupling superconductivity at higher T c . Moreover, the appropriate interband coupling also helps the high T c . Thus searching a new two-band superconductor is meaningful and hopeful to obtain a much higher T c.","0"

Until superconductivity was found in electron doped cuprates 1) the initial research efforts focused on hole doped cuprate systems. When electron doped cuprates are synthesized, an annealing process is necessary in order to induce superconductivity since the as-grown sample contains non-stoichiometric oxy- gen. This annealing process is performed under reducing atmospheres, e.g., Ar or vacuum. The reduction process causes severe modifications in the electronic structure, e.g., at optimal doping levels, the in-plane resistivity is modified from insulating to metallic and superconducting behavior. Moreover, angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data of optimally doped, as-grown Pr 1:85 -Ce 0:15 CuO 4 samples have shown that antiferromagnetic (AF) order exists, resulting in a leading edge gap along the nodal direction. However, after the application of a reduction process, the long-range AF order is suppressed and the leading edge gap is filled up. Hence, the reduction process does neither inject carriers nor modify the band dispersion, in contrast to general assumptions.","0"

When the annealing con- ditions are optimized for a given cerium substitution level, samples with low substitution levels, i.e., Pr 1:96 Ce 0:04 CuO 4 , become superconducting. It has been pointed out 7) that the annealing parameters, i.e., time, temperature, and atmos- phere, need to be altered upon a variation of the Ce substitution level. Recently, we have shown that super- conductivity can be induced even in the extreme limit of dopant-free RE 2 CuO 4 (RE = rare earth). These results unambiguously expose the electronic ground state of square- planar coordinated cuprates as a superconductor rather than an antiferromagnetic insulator. Beside the synthesis conditions of T 0 -cuprates, the annealing conditions also are thermodynamically constraint in order to avoid the formation of decomposition products, e.g., (Nd,Ce) 2 O 3 and Cu 2 O. 14,15) Idemoto et al. investi- gated the thermodynamic stability region of Nd 2Àx Ce x CuO 4 and observed an extended stability range for higher Ce 4þ concentrations. Consequently, the thermodynamic boundary conditions during the reduction process are less stringent for doped than for dopant-free samples. Moreover, any additional atom species in a system increases the entropy during crystallization thus leading to a higher defect con- centration level as compared to dopant-free sample. Since the annealing process is a diffusion driven process where oxygen atoms move along the CuO 2 planes and along the grain boundaries of the crystal, many parameters have to be taken into account in order to optimize the annealing process. Thin film samples show a significantly larger surface-to-volume ratio compared to bulk powder or single crystal samples, thus they are more viable for timesaving tuning of the annealing parameters.

Peaks marked by are (00l) reflections of the substrate. variation of the net oxygen concentration towards the film- substrate interface therefore monotonously increases the c-axis length. Thus, the coexistence of unequally reduced grains (diameter % 200-300 nm) is supported by a broader (109) diffraction spot in RSM [Fig. 3(b)] than that of Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 []. For increasing magnetic field inductions, the superconducting transition is shifted to lower temperatures, due to the pair-breaking character of the magnetic field. At B ¼ 6 T, zero resistivity is not observed at 1.8 K for both samples, albeit a drastic drop of the resistivity value appears. For B ¼ 8 T, both samples do not show any signs of superconductivity. Therefore, we conclude that the upper critical magnetic field is nearly identically about 0 H c2 % 6 T, even though both samples significantly deviate each other since one is a so-called 'optimally-doped' and the other is a dopant-free T 0 -cuprate superconductor. The upper critical magnetic field provides an estimation of the superconducting coherence length GL % 7 nm. For magnetic fields larger than 8 T, the resistivity behavior is found to be quite different between the samples. While an upturn of the resistivity is found for Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 below 12 K, the dopant-free Nd 2 CuO 4 cuprate shows metallic behavior over the entire temperature range. The resistivity upturn might be associated to a localization effect caused by apical oxygen ions although further investigations are necessary to clarify its origin. 32) Finally, we make a comment on the origin of electron carriers in Nd 2 CuO 4 . In both Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 and Nd 2 CuO 4 , the as-grown samples are insulating and super- conductivity appears after a reduction treatment. In the case of Ce-substituted Pr 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 , Richard et al. demon- strated, that the reduction process does not alter the carrier concentration. Such a scenario can be projected to the case of cerium free Nd 2 CuO 4 samples, thus, scenarios where oxygen vacancies provide electron carriers to the CuO 2 planes might be ruled out. The difference between Nd 2 CuO 4 and Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 is simply a modified thermodynamic stability region of the annealing procedure. At present, site- resolved oxygen occupancy measurement data of super- conducting Nd 2 CuO 4 thin films do not exist. However, it is safe to exclude the possibility of an O1 deficiency in the CuO 2 plane, which results in non-superconducting or insulating samples. An O2 deficiency in the Nd 2 O 2 fluorite layer also appears unlikely since the Nd-O bond is significantly stronger compared to the Cu-O bond. Hence, there are no experimental data suggesting a modification of the O2 occupancy upon annealing. At the very moment, the sole mechanism rendering a non-superconducting Nd 2 CuO 4 into a superconducting Nd 2 CuO 4 sample upon annealing is the evacuation of apical sites although further investigation on site specific oxygen occupancies are vital for a sound comprehension of the superconductivity influencing factors in T 0 -cuprates.","0"

Atomic concentrations shown in are normalized to 100% but we note that no significant con- taminant peaks are present in any of the spectra used to produce these results. For each sample spectrum two different composition estimates were obtained, the first using only the Zr-Lα and Zn-Kα peaks and the second using Zr-Lα and Zn-Lα. The presence of two character- istic Zn X-ray peaks of very different energy provides a check on our correction procedure because the correction factor is much larger for Zn-Lα than for Zn-Kα. The excellent agreement between the two estimates for the polished surface shows that the correction procedure pro-vides accurate results in this ideal geometry. The small discrepancy (at the 1% atomic concentration level) may arise, for example, from the correction model used or from a slight tilt of the sample surface relative to the electron beam. Importantly, the results for the spark-cut surface obtained using the different Zn peaks are also in good agreement. The discrepancy is larger than in the case of the polished surface due to the effects of surface roughness on the X-ray intensity corrections.

Thus the simplest expla- nation for our results is that the observed downturns in ρ(T ) and χ(T ) are due to a surface layer of a supercon- ducting alloy, with higher Zr content than ZrZn 2, that is created by spark erosion.

This compound is the first to be discovered supercon- ducting Co oxide and moreover, it has been claimed that there is a marked resemblance between this compound and high T C cuprates. The first similarity is that the compound has a layered structure composed of two- dimensional (2D) CoO 2 planes, separated by a thick insu- lating layer of Na ions and water molecules. As is widely known, high T C cuprates have also layered structures with 2D CuO 2 planes which play an essential role in the high T C superconductivity. The second similarity is re- lated to valences and spin states of the transition metals. The Cu ions of the high T C cuprates are of mixed-valence states by hole doping; Cu 2+ (S=1/2) ions are partially oxidized to Cu 3+ (S=0) ions. In a similar way, the Co ion in the Co oxide is either Co 4+ (d 5 ) or Co 3+ (d 6 ) with a spin state of S=1/2 or S=0, respectively, assuming low- spin configurations.","1"

In the nondoped CuO 2 planes with Cu 2+ (S=1/2) ions, antiferromagnetic long-range order is the ground state, but such a simple picture is not applicable for the hypothetical nondoped CoO 2 plane with Co 4+ (S=1/2) ions because of geometric frustration expected for the triangular lattice. Thus, it is not clear whether the ground state of the CoO 2 plane is an antiferromagnet- ically ordered state or a resonating-valence-bonds (RVB) state.

"3270","P072224509-CC","2","The traditional concept of superconductivity is strictly associated with the electron-phonon interaction. The conventional theory is based on the Migdal-Eliashberg adiabatic approximation that, in fact, leads to the prediction of many peculiar features which are a di- rect evidence of a phonon mediated superconductivity. The adiabatic approximation is valid if the parameter ω 0 /E f is small (ω 0 is the relevant phonon frequency and E f is the Fermi energy). Usually this parameter is regarded as a measure of nonadibaticity. However, crossover from a conventional adiabatic to an unconven- tional nonadiabatic regime does not depend only on the value of the ω 0 /E f ratio. Paci et al. show that even in a case of small ""adiabatic"" ratio one would ex- pect the nonadiabatic coupling in superconductors hav- ing high value of the electron-phonon coupling constant λ el−ph . Among BCS superconductors the zirconium do- decaboride (ZrB 12 ) is probably a candidate for the ob- servation of such type of anomalous coupling. It stems from the rather small value of the Fermi energy ∼1 eV that, together with the Debye temperature ∼20 meV , leads to a ratio ω 0 /E f ∼0.02. A strong coupling ratio 2∆/k B T c ≃ 4.8 was observed by surface sensitive techniques . This suggests that the electron-phonon coupling constant, which has a bulk value λ el−ph ≃ 0.67 , increases at the surface. From the comparison with strong coupled metallic superconductors one would expect λ surf. el−ph ≃ 1.7 − 1.9.

In this paper we report on PE on T c and λ studies in ZrB 12 superconductor. The magnetic penetration depth measured in the Meissner state is largely determined by the surface characteristics. The absolute value of λ at zero temperature and zero pressure was found to be λ(0) = 140(30) nm.

In contrast to T c , λ −2 (0) was found to in- crease with dλ −2 (0)/dp = 0.29(11) µm −2 /kbar. Only a small part of this effect can be explained by a pressure induced renormalization of the electron-phonon interac- tion and the band structure changes.

From the other hand a smaller value ≃3.7 has been reported by Lortz et al. using the heat- capacitance technique, thus suggesting a weak coupling strength.

Our measurements were performed in the Meissner state, with the field penetrating on a dis- tance λ from the surface and, therefore, give a value of the superconducting gap consistent with those one reported in the surface sensitive experiments . To estimate the uncertainty in the absolute value of λ(0) we used a procedure similar to that one described in Refs. . The temperature dependence of λ(T ) was calculated for N (R) + N (R) and N (R) − N (R) distributions. The fit of the resulting λ(T ) curves with the power law as well as with the BCS model gives λ(0) in the range from 110 to 170 nm. shows the pressure dependence of λ −2 (0) obtained by fitting the reconstructed λ(T ) data at dif- ferent pressures with the BCS model [Eq. ]. In these experiments we studied relative effects measured on the same sample in the same pressure cell. The main system- atic error of these measurements comes from misalign- ments of the experimental setup occurring when the cell is removed from the SQUID magnetometer, to change the pressure, and put back again. This procedure was checked with a set of measurements at constant pressure. The systematic scattering of the magnetization data is about 0.3%, giving a relative error in λ −2 (T ) of about 3%. The reducing of the grain size with pressure was taken into account in λ(T ) calculation [Eq. (4)], by using the bulk modulus reported above.

In oxygen-doped La 2 CuO 4+y , the excess oxygen is intercalated between the Cu-O planes and forms a sine-density-wave, which is periodic along the c-axis. This behavior is called staging. Stage-n cor- responds to a period of n Cu-O layers. The sample stud- ied here is predominantly in the stage-4 phase, which has its superconducting transition at T c = 43 K. The onset of static long-range magnetic order coincides with the on- set of superconductivity. Note that T c = 43 K is higher than that of optimally-doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 , which is possibly due to the absence of quenched disorder from a random distribution of Sr 2+ dopants. Previous neutron scattering experiments show no gap in the spin excita- tions in this sample. Our sample shows the onset of a diamagnetic signal at 43 K when measuring magnetization at an applied magnetic field of 3 Oe (see the main panel of Fig. ). The structure observed in the magnetization at around 32 K almost certainly comes from small inclusions of the stage-6 phase with T c = 32 K. We have estimated the superconducting volume at 5 K from the slope of the magnetic moment vs. field at low fields (inset B of Fig. ), corrected by a demagnetiza- tion factor of 3/2 for a sphere.

However, we did not observe any anomaly associated with the simultaneous onset of the static incommensurate magnetic order neither in the absence nor in the presence of the applied field of up to 15 T.

"3304","P069174506-CC","22","Doping La 2 CuO 4 with oxygen leads to three effects which might contribute to the excess specific heat: (i) changes in the vibrational spectrum caused by ex- cess oxygen; (ii) free carrier excitations; and (iii) changes in the spectrum of magnetic excitations. The staging of the interstitial oxygen is accompanied by a periodic re- versal in the direction of the tilt of the CuO 6 octahedra along the c-axis. This will likely cause a small change in the phonon spectrum. However, such a difference would give rise to a change in the specific heat that is mono- tonic with increasing temperature, rather than the broad peak we observe. The broad peak is reminiscent of the Schottky anomaly for a system with a finite number of excited states, such as a spin-1 2 moment in a magnetic field. From the temperature of the peak we infer that, were such two-level systems responsible for the excess specific heat, the energy splitting of the two levels would be ∼ 7 meV. We cannot exclude the possibility that the interstitial oxygens have a two-level systems associated with it, however, we think it is more likely that the excess specific heat is associated with a disordered component of the spin system, as discussed below.","0"
"3305","P069174506-CC","23","The contribution to the specific heat from the free car-riers must be small. Indeed, above T c we use the BCS estimate γ=∆C/1.43 T c ≈ 6 mJ/mol K 2 , far less than that observed. In addition, as for any change in the phonon spectrum, free carriers are not expected to give a peak in the specific heat. We suggest, instead, that the excess specific heat shown in Fig. comes from a change in the spectrum of spin excitations resulting from the doping. The contribu- tion of the spins to the specific heat in the 2D S= 1 2 square lattice Heisenberg AFM (Quantum Heisenberg Antifer- romagnet QHA) become important at temperatures of order the in-plane exchange constant J. Monte-Carlo simulations of this model show that the heat capacity exhibits a broad peak at k B T ≃ 0.6 J . Since the excess specific heat reported here is observed at 50 K, as- cribing the excess specific heat to that of a QHA would imply that J is suppressed from ∼ 135 meV to ∼ 7 meV by doping. However, this conclusion contradicts results from neutron scattering. The instantaneous magnetic correlation length, measured by integrating over all the energies up to ∼ 100 meV is almost constant as a func- tion of temperature in the optimally-doped or slightly underdoped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 . 1 If J were in fact reduced by doping to 7 meV, then the correlation length would rise dramatically at low temperatures. Although the in- stantaneous correlation length has not been measured in oxygen-doped La 2 CuO 4+y , its magnetic dynamics is very similar to slightly underdoped LSCO. Furthermore, we have measured the widths in q-space of the magnetic fluc- tuation peaks associated with the SDW order and find no increase in their width up to ∼ 9 meV. This allows us to place a lower bound on J in the superconductor of 60 meV. We conclude that the excess specific heat is not described by the QHA with reduced J.","0"

We would not expect such a contribution since the nearest-neighbor spin correlations are already established at much higher temperatures, and hence there would not be enough ex- cess entropy at 50 K to observe experimentally.","0"
"3307","P069174506-CC","25","There is a connection between the excess specific heat and the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibil- ity χ ′′ (ω) measured with neutron scattering around the (π, π) point for slightly underdoped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 . The latter shows a maximum as the energy transfer is lowered, at around 7 meV, before going to zero at lower energy. This maximum is most pronounced near the supercon- ducting transition temperature. This behavior shows that there is an enhancement of the (π, π) spin fluctua- tions at ∼ 7 meV in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 of similar hole den- sity to the La 2 CuO 4.11 sample studied here. The suscep-tibility around (π, π) of La 2 CuO 4.11 does not show such a maximum, but rather is approximately constant at low energies. For the latter material χ ′′ (ω) is enhanced at low energies relative to that in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 because of the magnons associated with the static long-range-ordered incommensurate SDW. However, muon measurements in- dicate that the local magnetic order is fully developed microscopically at only about 40% of the muon sites. The remaining 60% of the sample, which has a very small ordered moment, is likely to have spin excitations closely similar to those in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (x=0.14) and should exhibit the enhanced spin fluctuations at around 7 meV. We speculate, therefore, that the broad anomaly in the specific heat reflects the enhanced magnetic fluctuations coming from the disordered 2D spin-1 2 system. Naively, one expects the entropy associated with these fluctuations to be even smaller than the contribution from the moments that order below 42K. Consequently, the large enhancement of spin fluctuations observed in the experiments must the result of an interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom. The relevant energy scale for the charge degrees of freedom is given by the su- perconducting transition temperature, T c = 43 K, close to the temperature at which the excess specific heat is observed.","0"

One main topic was the evolution of the Fermi surface by doping . While this momentum resolved information attainable with the resolving power of new analysers enabled a lot of insight into details of the electronic structure, a class of models like t-J-, Hubbard-model, and others yield results without explicit momentum resolution. Here the evolution of the spectral density at E F , which in this paper is used synonymously with density of states, is treated without explicit k- resolution. While numerous studies exist, which cover only a limited doping range and enable a comparison to the above quoted theories just in this restricted range, we found just two publications covering the entire doping range . The focus of these studies on the La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO)-system was the underdoped range, where effects due to the pseudogap and the spectral weight renormalization were discussed for the occupied DOS. Interestingly in the overdoped range the DOS at E F was found to converge to a constant value and a similar trend was observed by Romberg et al. for the unfilled DOS by EELS. Although the authors did not explicitly comment on this, in a naive view one would expect an increasing DOS with increasing hole concentration. Since the optimum doping regime with highest T c can be approached by doping from both sides, we found a strong demand for a comparative study on a different compound covering for the first time the occupied and the unoccupied DOS, to see whether the evolution of the DOS follows a common trend. One of the main research topics for HTC's is to find such universal properties like the pseudogap behaviour or, more general, the basic physics underlying the phase diagram.","0"

This problem is more complex for the La-doped Bi-2201 system since there is doping by replacement of Sr-and Bi-ions by La-and Pb- ions, respectively, and additionally hole doping by changes of the oxygen content in the material, all of which can affect the doping level of the CuO 2 sheets. Therefore, at least, methods for determining solely the oxygen content such as iodine titration or thermogravimetry are not sufficient for this system. These difficulties can in principle be overcome by measurements of the Hall coefficient respectively thermopower. Since R H is temperature dependent and must be normalized to equal volume and number of Cu- atoms, a quantitative calculation of R H is intricate. An example of the necessary procedures is given in . The authors investigated different HTC's at optimum (highest T c ) hole concentration and found R H (T) to show similar values at room temperature when properly normalized. From this it was concluded, that a comparison of room temperature R H values of various HTC's at different doping levels to LASCO data at room temperature is the best choice. Furthermore and apart from the considerations of this study it can be stated, that the effective carrier concentration measured by the Hall effect must not be identical to the carrier concentration in the CuO 2 -planes . From these reasons we have chosen a more straightforward way by analysing the Cu L 3 - absorption edge.

This is in agreement with the observations from Ando et al. based on Hall measurements on the same material. Besides the occupied density of states at the Fermi level, extracted from photoemission (PES) data, an additional goal of this paper is the unoccupied density of states. For this, detailed investigations of the O K-edge have been performed. A comparison of the O 1s absorption edges of n = 1, 2, and 3 BSCO can be found in Müller et al. . It is established that the states at the Fermi energy have primarily O 2p-character and are connected with the prepeak feature of the O 1s → 2p absorption edge. The intensity of the prepeak is mainly interpreted as a direct measure of the hole concentration . In contradiction to this assumption there are hints already in this previous experiment which will be confirmed here by a large number of measured samples that for hole overdoping the intensity of the prepeak is not further increasing but saturating. Therefore an alternative explanation of the origin of the O 1s prepeak consistent with all observations has to be found.","0"

While for LSCO the authors studied only two or three overdoped samples, for BSLCO we studied the overdoped region in great detail on a large number of samples.

"3342","P072014504-CC","23","It is interesting to relate the results of the occupied density of states to that from angular resolved photoemission. The change of D(E F ) with increasing hole concentration can then be interpreted in relation to the evolution of the Fermi surface with doping studied in detail for LSCO . In lightly-doped cuprates the density of the states at the Fermi level is found to be formed by so-called ""Fermi arcs"" , which build up part of the hole-like Fermi surface around the nodal directions, i.e. (0,0) -(π,π) and equivalents, of the Brillouin zone. It should be mentioned that the Fermi arcs are due to a small sharp peak crossing E F in the nodal direction, but is observed until yet only in the second Brillouin zone . In addition, these first time observations have to be confirmed in other single-layer cuprates, like e.g. n = 1 BLSCO. The spectral weight due to the arcs increases with hole doping in line with the D(E F ) increase of the underdoped regime shown in comparison. On the other hand, the flat band around the anti-nodal (0,0) -(π,0) direction of the Brillouin zone, located for low hole concentrations well below E F , gradually moves up to E F with increasing hole doping for LSCO . In addition for LSCO with stronger overdoping the energy gap around (π,0) closes and an electron-like Fermi surface is formed at p = 0.30. In principle, from such a closed electron-like Fermi surface constant density of states D(E F ) could be expected, although a similar closure has not been observed in BISCO yet. For our polycrystalline samples a maximum hole concentration of p = 0.22 was obtained. It can be speculated, that for the single crystalline samples of BISCO used in angular resolved photoemission studies for Fermi surface mapping a similar limiting value exists, which is decisively below the value of p = 0.30 for LSCO, so that the LSCO is more heavily overdoped. Also different in n = 1 BSLCO is that the constant D(E F ) begins already at about optimum doping of p = 0.16 and p = 0.17 for Pb-doped and Pb-free samples, respectively. For optimum hole doping, the flat band around the anti- nodal direction of the band structure is certainly below E F and can therefore not be the explanation for a constant D(E F ).","0"

This can be seen as hint to the consistency of the interpretation of our data in form of density of states at the Fermi level derived from the filled and unfilled side of E F . Previously, the prepeak of the O K-edge was interpreted in a straight forward manner as reflecting the hole concentration directly . If this would be true a similar intensity behavior of the prepeak would be expected as the oxygen ligand line at the Cu L 3 -edge, i.e. one would expect a continuous increase in the underdoped as well as in the overdoped regime. Clearly, the experimental results are contradictory to this and an alternative explanation of the origin of the O 1s prepeak has to be found. Now the results of the LSCO single layer system from literature should be compared with that of BSLCO of the present work. shows the density of states at the Fermi level derived from PES on La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 by Ino et al. and Yoshida et al. . In agreement with BSLCO, in both experiments on LSCO D(E F ) increases continuously for low doping and reveals a plateau for the overdoped region. In addition to this, also the unoccupied states derived by Romberg et al. from electron energy-loss spectroscopic (EELS) investigations of the O 1s prepeak reveal a similar increase of the intensity and, in principle, also the plateau in line with our XAS data and the PES results discussed above, although they studied only one overdoped sample (see ). Romberg et al. draw two lines to their data points, one solid line following the evolution of the data point by point and a second dashed straight line indicating a linear relationship between hole doping and prepeak intensity. According to the large number of data of the overdoped regime discussed here, for BSLCO as well as LSCO, we can now conclude that the linear increase is wrong and that the evolution into constant density of states for overdoped single layer cuprates is established. This result, on the other hand, needs a better interpretation for the origin of the O 1s prepeak than simply a count of holes in the CuO 2 -plane. An explanation could be that besides the localized holes on Cu sites, upon doping two types of holes are introduced into the samples both located in the CuO 2 -planes. Both types of doped holes determine the intensity of the oxygen ligand line at the Cu L 3 -edge but only one type determines the intensity of the prepeak of the O K-edge. The O 1s prepeak has been called ""mobile carrier peak"" by Abbamonte et al. .

"3351","P070214505-CC","1","Low temperature specific heat has been measured and extensively analyzed on a series of La2−xSrxCuO4 single crystals from underdoped to overdoped regime. From these data the quasi- particle density of states (DOS) in the mixed state is derived and compared to the predicted scaling law C vol /T √ H = f (T / √ H) of d-wave superconductivity. It is found that the scaling law can be nicely followed by the optimally doped sample (x=0.15) in quite wide region of (T / √ H ≤ 8K/ √ T ). However, the region for this scaling becomes smaller and smaller towards more underdoped region: a clear trend can be seen for samples from x= 0.15 to 0.069. Therefore, generally speaking, the scaling quality becomes worse on the underdoped samples in terms of scalable region of T / √ H. This feature in the underdoped region is explained as due to the low energy excitations from a sec- ond order (for example, anti-ferromagnetic correlation, d-density wave, spin density wave or charge density wave order) that may co-exist or compete with superconductivity. Surprisingly, deviations from the d-wave scaling law have also been found for the overdoped sample (x=0.22). While the scaling law is reconciled for the overdoped sample when the core size effect is taken into account. An important discovery of present work is that the zero-temperature data follow the Volovik's relation ∆γ(T = 0) = A √ H quite well for all samples investigated here although the applicability of the d-wave scaling law to the data at finite temperatures varies with doped hole concentration. Finally we present the doping dependence of some parameters, such as, the residual linear term γ0, the α value, etc. It is suggested that the residual linear term (γ0T ) of the electronic specific heat observed in all cuprate superconductors is probably due to the inhomogeneity, either chemical or electronic in origin. The field induced reduction of the specific heat in the mixed state is also reported. Finally implications on the electronic phase diagram are suggested.","0"
"3352","P070214505-CC","2","One of few points with consensus in the cuprate su- perconductors is the d x 2 −y 2 pairing symmetry in hole doped region. This has been supported by tremen- dous experiments 1 both from surface detection 2,3,4,5,6 and bulk measurements . In a d-wave su- perconductor with line nodes in the gap function, the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) N (E) rises linearly with energy at the Fermi level in zero field, i.e., N (E) ∝ |E − E F |, resulting in 15 an electronic specific heat C e = αT 2 , where α ∝ γ n /T c and γ n is the specific heat which is proportional to the DOS at the Fermi level of the nor- mal state. In the mixed state with the field higher than a certain value, the DOS near the Fermi surface becomes finite, therefore the quadratic term C e = αT 2 will be surpassed and substituted by both the localized excita- tions inside the vortex core and the de-localized excita- tions outside the core. pointed out that for d- wave superconductors in the mixed state, supercurrents around a vortex core lead to a Doppler shift to the quasi- particle excitation spectrum, which affects strongly the low energy excitation around the nodes. It was shown that the contribution from the delocalized part (outside the core) will prevail over the core part and the specific heat is predicted to behave as C vol = kγ n T H/H c2 with k in the order of unity. This prediction has been ver- ified by many measurements which were taken as the evi- dence for d-wave symmetry . In the finite temperature and field region a scaling law is proposed as with T / √ H ≤ T c / H c2 (0). This scaling law can be further converted into the form of C vol /H = g(T / √ H) or C vol /T 2 = y(T / √ H), here f (x), or g(x) or y(x) are unknown scaling functions. This scaling law has been proved in Y BCO and in LSCO. It remains however unclear whether this scaling law is still valid in the very overdoped region since the vortex core size ξ grows up. In the underdoped region, inelastic neu- tron scattering reveals that an anti-ferromagnetic order emerges when the superconductivity is suppressed . It is thus also interesting to check whether the d-wave scaling law proposed by Simon and Lee is applicable in underdoped regime. In addition, the Simon-Lee scaling law is in agreement with the calculations as proposed by in two extreme conditions of temperature. In the low temperature limit the scaling law C vol /T 2 = y(T / √ H) becomes the Volovik's relation C vol = AT √ H. When the temperature is increased, an- other relation C ∝ aT 2 + bH is reached. The boundary between these two regions is T / √ H = T c / √ H c2 accord- ing to Volovik and Kopnin . These theoretical models can be quantitatively tested by experiments on samples with different doping concentrations.","0"

However this is in sharp contrast with the experimental observations , mainly on optimally doped samples. The absence of a ZBCP within the vortex cores was attributed to the presence of id xy or is components 28 , or the competing orders (see later). In this paper we show that the DOS due to vortex quasiparticle excitations de- viates from Simon-Lee scaling law for the overdoped sam- ple, but follows rather well with the optimally doped one. The deviations for the overdoped sample are found to be induced by the vortex core size effect. In the extremely underdoped region, it is found that the Simon-Lee scal- ing law fails, except for in very low temperature region. This can be understood as due to the competing order emerging within or nearby the vortex cores.","0"

The overdoped sample has a mass about 28.55 mg and 3.66 × 2.3 × 0.5mm 3 in dimension. The opti- mally doped sample weighs about 23.6 mg with dimen- sions of 3.1 × 3 × 0.5mm 3 . For the underdoped sample with nominal concentration x=0.063, before annealing, it has a superconducting transition temperature of about 12 K and a mass of about 32.89mg and 3.75 x 2.75 x 0.5mm 3 in dimensions. By fitting to the empirical rela- tion T c /T max c = 1 − 82.6(p − 0.16) 2 with T max c = 38K the maximum T c at the optimal doping point p = 0.16, we estimate that the hole concentration of this sample is around p = 0.069. After annealing in flowing Ar gas for 48h, the T c drops down from about 12 K to 9 K indi- cating that the sample becomes more underdoped. Note that T c =9 K is expected exactly by the empirical relation at x = p = 0.063.","1"

The sample is put onto a micro-chip on which there is a tiny Cernox temperature sensor, a film heater. The micro-chip together with the sample are hung up by golden wires in vacuum. These golden wires are the only thermal links between the micro-chip and the thermal sink whose temperature is well controlled. The temperature of the micro-chip is controlled by the on-board small film heater and measured by the on-board thermometer. When the temperature of the micro-chip is stable, a heating power with fixed current is sent to the film heater on the chip and the time dependence of the chip temperature is measured simultaneously. The change of temperature is fitted to an exponential rela- tion ∆T = ∆T 0 × [1 − exp(−t/τ )], and heat capacity is determined by τ = (C + C add )/κ w , here C and C add are the heat capacity of the sample and addenda (includ- ing a small sapphire substrate, small printed film heater, tiny Cernox temperature sensor, φ25 µm gold wire leads, Wakefield thermal conducting grease (about 100µg) re- spectively, where κ w is the thermal conductance between the chip and the thermal link. The value C add has been measured and subtracted from the total heat capacity, thus C value reported here is only that from the sample. In we present the temperature and field dependence of the heat capacity from the addenda and three typical samples. It is clear that the heat capacity of the addenda is much smaller than the value of the samples. In addi- tion, the data of C/T for the addenda extrapolates to zero at T = 0K showing the only existence of phonon part. One can also see that almost no field dependence can be observed for the addenda. However, for all sam- ples, there is a clear finite intercept at T = 0K which gives rise to a residual linear term γ 0 . Meanwhile the field induced change can be easily observed for all sam- ples, even for the very underdoped sample. The inter- crossing of the data at H = 0 and H = 12T at about 6K for the undedoped sample is understandable and will be discussed later.","0"

In low temperature region the curves are rather linear showing that the major part is due to phonon contribu- tion C ph = βT 3 + δT 5 . It is known that the phonon part is independent on the magnetic field, this allows to remove the phonon contribution by subtracting the C/T at a certain field with that at zero field. The results af- ter the substraction are shown in . The subtracted values ∆γ = γ(H) − γ(0) = [C(T, H) − C(T, H = 0)]/T exhibit a rather linear T dependence in low temperature region. One can also see that the negative slope is actu- ally field dependent. In the following we will show that the field dependent slope of the linear part in low tem- perature region shown in directly deviates from the Simon-Lee 18 scaling law. According to Simon-Lee scaling law C vol /T √ H = f (T / √ H), in low temperature region, the Volovik's rela- tion restores, thus one has C vol /T = A √ H and further has This clearly shows that there is a negative slope for ∆γ vs. T , but the slope α is a constant. However, from one can see that the slope changes slightly with the magnetic field H. This indicates that only the Volovik's relation is not enough to interpret the data. In the fol- lowing we will take both the core size effect and finite temperature effect into account. The former has not been considered in the original Simon-Lee scaling law since the size of the vortex core was thought to be small, and the contribution from that small region is negligible. If the vortex core size becomes bigger, this should be reconsid- ered when counting the DOS due to the Doppler shift effect.","1"

A linear behavior is clearly seen in low temperature region with a field dependent slope, which is not in accord with the pro- posed scaling law by Simon and Lee (see text). The straight lines in low temperature region are guides to the eyes. From these lines one can determine the zero temperature intercept ∆γ and the slope d∆γ/dT shown in Fig.5 low temperature limit and high temperature limit sug- gested by Volovik and Kopnin 21 , making Taylor's expan- sion to the right hand side of Simon-Lee scaling law leads to where b 0 = 0 because C vol /T should not diverge when T = 0 and H = 0, b1 = A. Since o(T 3 ) is very small in low temperature region, one thus has Interestingly, one can see that this simple formula contains the results both in the low tempera- ture limit C vol = b 1 T √ H 15,16,31 and high temperature limit 21,31 C vol = b 2 T 2 . This is not surprising since a scaling function should be more general and cover most possible cases. When H c1 << H << H c2 , the total spe- cific heat contains four parts: Doppler shift term from the region outside the core C vol , the inner vortex core term C core ∝ HT , the residual linear term γ 0 T and the phonon term C ph . Here it is assumed that the heat ca- pacity contributed by the core region is equal for each vortex and independent on the external magnetic field, thus C core depends only on the vortex density which is proportional to H. The local DOS measured by STM 26 revealed that the low energy DOS within the vortex core differs only slightly from the case for a d-wave supercon- ductivity (outside and far away from the vortex core). When changing the external magnetic field, the low en- ergy DOS within the vortex core is not expected to vary too much. At zero field, the total specific heat contains three parts: γ 0 T and C ph , and a quadratic term αT 2 due to the thermal excitation near the nodal region. Thus ∆γ can be written as:","0"

"3366","P070214505-CC","16","Let us keep going, still based on eq.5, we propose that the core size effect may have a sizable influence on the total vortex quasiparticle excitations. This is actually reasonable since the vortex core with size ξ ∝hv F /∆ s grows up in the overdoped side due to smaller supercon- ducting gap value 32 , where v F is the Fermi velocity and ∆ s is the superconducting gap. By taking the vortex core size (2ξ) into account, i.e., deducting the normal core area away from the Volovik term, one can rewrite ∆γ as where ξ is the radius of the normal core, R a is the outer radius of a single vortex where the supercurrent is flowing, thus R 2 a = φ 0 /πH. Reorganizing all terms in eq.6 leads to One can see that the third term in eq.7 is just what we need for interpreting the difficulty as mentioned above. It is necessary to recall that the core size correction is pro- portional to ξ 2 , for example, it will be four times when ξ doubles. Thus increase of ξ in the overdoped side will give sizable effect on the total DOS and core size effect should be considered. Next let us have a closer inspec- tion at the data and derive some parameters. At zero temperature, only the first term and the last term are left in eq.7. The values of ∆γ(T = 0) are determined from the extrapolation of the linear lines in to 0 K and presented in . The data ∆γ(H, T = 0) is also determined by doing linear fit to the raw data C/T vs. T 2 between 2K and 4K, and then subtracted the zero temperature value γ 0 . The results are quite close to each other by using these two different methods. The solid line in is a fit to the data using the first term in eq.7 yielding b1 = 1.995 ± 0.046mJK −2 T −1/2 and πξ 2 /φ 0 = 0.012 ± 0.003 and thus ξ = 28.2Å. The value ξ = 28Å derived here is quite close to that found in Nernst 33 and STM measurements 26 (20Å for opti- mally doped Bi-2212 sample). We also tried to use the first term together with the last term to fit the data but find out that the contribution from the last term is extremely small. The first term here describes the zero temperature data very well, indicating the absence of a second component of order parameter such as id xy or is since otherwise the Fermi surface would be fully gapped and the Doppler shift had very weak effect on the quasiparticle excitations. The inset of shows the field dependence of the slope of the linear part in . It is clear that the slope increases roughly lin- early with H above 1 T. This can be exactly anticipated by the second and third terms in eq.7. From the in- set of By tak- ing ξ = 28.2Å, we obtain the following values: α = 0.501mJmol −1 K −3 and b 2 = 0.196mJmol −1 K −3 . The value of α = 0.501mJmol −1 K −3 found here is quite close to the value obtained by fitting the zero field data to eq.2 (0.465 mJ/molK 2 see . Since the contribution from the core region (last term in eq.7) is negligible com- paring to the Volovik term, from eq.7 one understands that the failure of using the Simon-Lee scaling law in very overdoped sample is due to the core size effect. This is actually quite reasonable since the core size in the over- doped region grows up. Sofar we don't know yet whether the negligible contribution from the core region is because of the gapped feature within the core region as found in optimally and underdoped samples , or it is naturally small comparing to the contributions from the Doppler shift effect of the surrounding superfluid. This casts a interesting issue for future STM measurement on the tunnelling spectrum within the vortex cores in very overdoped region.","0"

The failure of using Simon-Lee scaling law in Nohara's experiment for opti- mally doped sample is in contradiction with the reports from many other groups . This may be caused by the way that they used to derive ∆γ. As stressed in pre- vious subsection, we use ∆γ = [C H||c − C H=0 ]/T instead of using ∆γ = [C H||c − C H⊥C ]/T to derive the field in- duced change of γ. The latter (as used by Nohara et al.) may inevitably involve the unknown DOS contributions from another kind of vortices (for example, Josephson vortices) when H ⊥ C.

This is in consistent with the fact that an unreasonable negative value for πξ 2 /φ 0 is obtained if we fit the zero temperature data in to the first term of eq.7. Both indicate that the failure of Simon-Lee scaling law here is not due to the core size effect. One may argue that the data is scalable with only a very narrow scaling region of T / √ H, for example, from , the scalable region is about T / √ H ≤ 1.5KT −0.5 . This is of course possible since we don't know the precise value for many parame- ters. However we can have a rough estimation to check whether this is reasonable.

"3386","P070214505-CC","36","Another possible reason for the failure of the scaling law is that the sample is in the underdoped region with a pseudogap in the normal state. When the sample is in the mixed state, some competing or coexisting order such as short range antiferromagnetic order , or the SDW order 42 , or a d-density wave (DDW) order 43 is enhanced, and this newly generated or enhanced or- der will certainly give contribution to the total specific heat. For example, for 2D AF correlation, it is known that C AF ∝ T 2 . Therefore qualitatively the failure of the Simon-Lee scaling law in underdoped region can be understood in the following way. By increasing the mag- netic field, a second order is generated or enhanced within the vortex core and nearby regions (about 100Å). On one hand this region is gapped leading to the decrease of the total DOS at fermi level simply by reducing the region where the supercurrent can flow. On the other hand the newly generated AF or SDW or DDW region will contribute a new term to the total specific heat due to spin or other type excitation. The relevant competing order under a magnetic field, according to both neutron scattering and NMR measurement 7 , may be the AF order. STM measurement by Hoffman et al. indicates a checkerboard like modulation with periodicity of 4a of the LDOS. This was regarded as the direct observation of the strong electronic correlation with the underlying competing order which was predicted by many theoreti- cal work . This qualitative picture calls for further detailed analysis and evidence from other ex- periments. Since the heat capacity from the newly gener- ated or enhanced second order has a temperature depen- dence of T ǫ with ǫ > 1, at zero temperature the specific heat from this term is zero, thus the H 1/2 law from the Doppler shift of the d-wave superconductivity is restored. This may be the reason for that the zero-temperature data follows the H 1/2 law but the data at finite temper- atures do not satisfy the Simon-Lee scaling very well.","0"

While quite surpris- ingly, for many samples with quite different γ 0 values, it is found that the zero temperature data can be expressed as γ(H, T = 0) = γ 0 + A √ H, showing evidence for d- wave pairing. This may suggest that γ 0 is not mainly induced by the impurity scattering, since otherwise the field induced extra DOS should not follow the relation ∆C(H, T = 0)/T = A √ H so well. In Fig.21, we present the field dependence of ∆γ = [C(H, T = 0) − C(0, T = 0)]/T normalized to the value for each sample at about 12 T. Meanwhile we show the H 1/2 law by the solid line. One can see that for almost all samples, the field induced extra DOS at zero K follows the H 1/2 relation reason- ably well despite the γ 0 value highly disperses. This fea- ture was also discovered by Chen et al. 14 on three typical samples (x = 0.10, 0.16 and 0.22). Nohara et al. mea-sured three single crystals (x = 0.10, 0.16 and 0.19) and empirically found that the optimally doped sample (x = 0.16) has the lowest value of γ 0 (γ 0 =2.8, 1.5 and 2.2 mJmol −1 K −2 for x=0.10, 0.16 and 0.19 respectively ob- tained from of Ref. ). Chen et al. 14 found the simi- lar behavior among three samples with x = 0.10, 0.16 and 0.22 (γ 0 =1.49, 0.7 and 1.41 mJmol −1 K −2 respectively). This raises the question of the origin of this residual linear term and its correlation with the field induced quasipar- ticle DOS. As mentioned before, if the field induced DOS is related to the impurity scattering, another relation 30 δγ/γ 0 = P 1 (H/P 2 )log(P 2 /H) is expected. This is some time contradicting to the experimental result (see dotted line in the main panel of ). In addition, the √ H dependence of the field induced change of γ is certainly not obtained by accident, since it is found on different samples from different groups, even on poly-crystalline samples . From the point of view of chemistry it is not true that the optimally doped sample is the clean- est one since in most cases the underdoped samples can be more easily grown with high quality. In this sense the residual linear term may be related to some other properties rather than the impurity scattering. In the γ 0 values for different single crystals measured in our experiment from underdoped to overdoped are shown. The value of γ 0 is obtained by fitting zero field data to eq.2 (see . It is clear that the minimum γ 0 is found in the region around 0.11 or 0.125. The value for γ 0 found from our data are more close to the data of Nohara et al. on single crystals, but clearly higher than that obtained on polycrystalline smples 14 . So far we don't know the reason for this discrepancy. For our extremely underdoped sample (x = 0.063) investigated here, although the data at finite temperatures cannot be treated with the Simon-Lee scaling law, the data in the low temperature limit T → 0 can be however still nicely expressed by γ(H, T = 0) = γ 0 + A √ H, even the ab- solute increase of γ(H, T = 0) by field is much smaller than γ 0 . Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the field induced part is mainly contributed by the Doppler shift effect on the supercurrent outside the vortex cores, while the residual linear term γ 0 is mainly contributed by some small normal regions which weakly depends on the magnetic field. Similar explanations to the origin of γ 0 have been suggested for many times in the past . This may be understood in the following way. In un- derdoped Bi − 2212 single crystals, scanning-tunneling- microscopic (STM) measurement indeed reveal a mixture of superconducting regions with sharp quasiparticle co- herent peaks on the tunnelling spectrum, and the non- superconducting regions with pseudogap-like tunneling spectrum 50 . In the overdoped side, the tiny normal cores as proposed in the Swiss cheese model 51 , or the mesoss- copic normal regions suggested by Fukuzumi et al. and Wen et al. will contribute a residual term γ 0 which does not show an apparent increase with the field. As pro- posed by Fukuzumi et al. that the dome-like electronic phase diagram may be formed by the mixture of three phases: anti-ferromagnetic phase in the extremely under- doped region, a d-wave superconducting region with the robust superconductivity near the optimal doping point and a non-superconducting Fermi liquid in the overdoped region. According to this simple picture the γ 0 should in- crease in the underdoped and overdoped region, which is just the case as shown by the data in . Therefore we would argue that the residual linear term may be mainly contributed by some non-superconducting regions due to phase separation, either chemical or electronic in origin. This interesting argument needs certainly to be further checked with data obtained by different techniques on different systems.","0"

"3390","P070214505-CC","40","In above analysis, we concentrate on the data below 10 K ( below 6 K for the very underdoped sample). This is also the temperature region that most of the low temper- ature specific heat data was reported in the literatures. Now we report another phenomenon: field induced re- duction of specific heat in the mixed state. In we present the temperature dependence of the field (12T) induced change of γ for three typical samples analyzed above, here ∆γ = [C(12T ) − C(0T )]/T . Although the data are strongly scattered one can still see that: (1) The field induced change ∆γ becomes negative at about 0.5 − 0.7T c ; (2) The curves have a similar shape: ∆γ is positive in low temperature region, then it becomes neg- ative and finally comes back to zero in high temperature region (near T c for optimal and overdoped sample). For the overdoped sample, the ∆γ keeps negative above 0.5T c until T c at which ∆γ suddenly goes back to zero. For the optimally doped one, the ∆γ is negative above about 0.7T c up to the highest temperature we measured here . However for the underdoped sample, it shows that the ∆γ keeps negative until 1.5T c . Similar data were obtained by Fisher et al. on samples with x = 0.15. Our data near T c is more scattered since our setup can only measure samples with maximum mass of 50 mg. This feature, namely the negative ∆γ in high temper- ature region is a consequence of entropy consideration, which has been observed in all types of superconductors. In low temperature region, when a magnetic field is ap- plied, vortices will be generated leading to higher DOS near Fermi surface, so that ∆γ = γ(H) − γ(0) is posi- tive. When the temperature is increased, to satisfy the field independent entropy above T c , in a certain region below T c , ∆γ should be negative. The most interest- ing point is for the underdoped sample here, even above T c one clearly sees a magnetic field induced change of entropy. This implies an abnormal normal state which is far from a conventional metal. For a conventional s- wave superconductor, the field induced change of γ can be negative near T c . It is difficult to understand the field induced reduction of specific heat well below T c , since the normal core region always gives rise to a higher DOS of quasiparticle. Outside the vortex core the DOS is almost negligible. However this field induced reduction of spe- cific heat well below T c is found to be a general feature of all LSCO crystals we investigated so far. This may be related to the intrinsic properties of cuprate super- conductors. In a d-wave superconductor, theoretically it is predicted that there is a ZBCP within the vortex core which should also contribute a quite high DOS in the mixed state. Besides, a high DOS will be generated by the Doppler shift effect of the supercurrent surrounding the vortex core. Normally the sum of these two terms are larger than the zero-field term C DOS = αT 2 , leading to a field induced enhancement of DOS in low tempera- ture region. When the temperature is high, the Doppler shift effect will be smeared out by the strong thermal ex- citation and finally ∆γ becomes negative. As far as we know, no quantitative theoretical expression about ∆γ has been reported so far for a d-wave superconductor in wide temperature region. We cannot have a quantitative understanding to our data. However, this field induced reduction of specific heat well below T c may be under- stood as due to the anomalous feature of vortex core state, i.e., a gapped vortex core as seen by the STM. , or based on the assumption that the contributions from the core region is much smaller than the outside region where either the Doppler shift or the strong thermal ex- citation dominates. Actually the Simon-Lee scaling law becomes a C vol ∝ T 2 relation in high temperature re- gion. In this case the quasiparticle excitation outside the vortex core is almost the same (αT 2 ) with or without applying a magnetic field. However since the vortex core region is gapped or contributes negligible part to the to- tal DOS, one needs to take the core region away from the total area in calculating ∆γ, naturally leading to a negative value of ∆γ.","0"

The negligible contribution from the vortex core region may suggest that the ZBCP is ab- sent within the cores, even in the overdoped region. This suggestion inferred from the specific heat measurement about the ZBCP within the vortex core is consistent with the tunnelling results and certainly clears up the concerns about the surface conditions in the STM measurement. Recent results from NMR also show the absence of a ZBCP inside the vortex core . In this sense our data together with the earlier NMR data present a bulk evidence for an anomalous vortex core. Interest- ingly it is widely perceived that the normal state in over- doped region shows a Fermi liquid behavior even when the superconductivity is completely suppressed 55 .

However, it is reconciled for the overdoped sample if one considers the core size effect provided the contribution from the inner vortex core is small comparing to that due to the Doppler shift in the same area. The Simon-Lee scaling law is applicable in the underdoped region only in very low temperature region. We attribute this to the ap- pearance of a second competing order (like AF or SDW or DDW) within and nearby the vortex core. The negli- gible contribution from the vortex core region may sug- gest the absence of the ZBCP in the vortex core, even in the overdoped region, although it is expected by the Bo- goliubov de-Gennes theory for a d-wave superconductor. Finally we present the doping dependence of the residual linear term γ 0 commonly observed in cuprate supercon- ductors.

The lowest temperature weight losses represent the evaporation of intergrain (surface) water, and the decomposition of the superhydrate to the intermediate hydrate. The plateau in weight from 35 to approximately 50 o C represents the stability region of the intermediate hydrate Na 0.3 CoO 2 •0.60H 2 O. This compound loses water in steps until decomposition to Na 0.5 CoO 2 and Co 3 O 4 at 300 o C. The inset to figure 2 compares the details of the weight loss characteristics of the two-layer and three-layer superconducting superhydrates at low temperatures. The lowest temperature weight losses are very similar, representing the evaporation of surface water. The hump at intermediate temperatures represents the water loss on decomposition of the superhydrate to the intermediate hydrate. From the weight loss observed, and the known formula of the intermediate hydrate, the formula for the superconducting superhydrate can be determined to be Na 0.30 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O (in both cases). Looking carefully at the inset to figure 2 it is can be seen that that the three-layer superconducting superhydrate decomposes to the intermediate hydrate at 35 degrees, five degrees lower than the decomposition temperature of the two-layer superconductor, indicating that it is even less thermally stable than that phase, essentially barely stable at ambient temperature.","0"

X- ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of three-layer Na 0.30 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O was therefore carried out in a sample holder that maintained the relative humidity around the sample at 100%. Figure shows the XRD pattern of the three-layer superconductor compared to that of the two-layer superconductor. As the distances between the CoO 2 sheets of the two superconductors are almost equal, defining the crystallographic c axis, the first three (00l) peaks are found at the same diffracted angles for both phases. However, on examining the higher angle peaks (inset), clear differences are seen in the patterns, allowing unambiguous distinction between the two phases and the purity of the synthesized three-layer phase. The X-ray diffraction pattern can be indexed by the same R-3m space group as the parent O3 NaCoO 2 phase. Clearly, the room temperature chemistry performed on the three-layer O3 NaCoO 2 host sodium cobalt oxide to prepare the superhydrate superconductor does not provide sufficient energy to rotate the CoO 6 octahedra from their orientations in O3 NaCoO 2, allowing the synthesis of a superconducting compound with a distinctly different crystal structure from that of the two- layer form.","0"

The data show that the material is a bulk superconductor, with superconducting characteristics similar to that of the double-layer cobaltate. In the three-layer system, however, we reproducibly observed a dependence of the superconducting properties on length of hydration time. Figure shows characteristic data illustrating this effect. In this set of experiments, anhydrous sodium cobaltate of nominal composition Na 0.3 CoO 2 , obtained in a 40X reaction with bromine, was placed in a hydration chamber where the hydration process is accomplished at ambient temperature on exposure to an atmosphere of 100% relative humidity. A small portion of the sample was removed in daily intervals for testing. The figure shows that the initial T c is in the range of 3K. The T c then increases to the optimal value, where it is stable for several days. Tc then degrades on further storage in the hydration atmosphere. Powder X-ray diffraction characterization of the material indicated that the three-layer Na 0.30 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O superconducting phase is present and single-phase to our experimental sensitivity for the duration of these experiments. Therefore the chemical changes that are taking place to yield the observations in figure do not involve decomposition of the superconducting phase but rather subtle structural or chemical changes. One possibility is that some Na may be leached out of the superconductor into the surrounding intergrain water over a period of several days 6 , 7 an effect that is accelerated for hydration by immersion in large volumes of liquid water. The observed change in Tc may therefore represent the leaching of a slightly Na rich composition through the optimal composition to a Na poor composition over a period of a week, tracing out the narrow peak in Tc vs. Na content . The lower chemical stability of the three- layer superhydrate at ambient conditions may be what allows this effect to be observed on a short laboratory time scale, but the general similarity of the chemistry of the phases suggests that this is may occur to a smaller degree in the two-layer superconductor as well.","1"

The difference in alignment of CoO 2 layers and oxygen coordination of the Na ions make the chemistry of the three- layer phase somewhat different from the two-layer phase, especially with respect to its stability in laboratory air at ambient temperature. This is likely due to differences in the H 2 O molecule arrangement necessary for bonding the two H 2 O layers to the oxygen in neighboring CoO 2 planes: neutron diffraction will be needed to shed light on the coordination of the water molecules and the Na ions in the three- layer superconductor. The identical superconducting critical temperatures observed in the two-layer and three-layer superconductors demonstrate that they are essentially electronically equivalent, and that electronic states that extend from one layer to the next do not appear to critically influence the superconductivity. The copper oxide superconductors do not include two compounds that differ only in the orientations or positions of neighboring layers while being identical in all other aspects of the chemistry and structure, such as formula and interlayer spacing, and so the effect of varying only the interlayer coupling can not be tested in the same manner as it can in the case of comparison of the properties of the two- layer and three-layer superconducting cobalt oxyhydrates.

In this report, we present additional tunneling data on Tl-2201 crystals with T c = 86 K that have been synthesized using a different technique than the one described in Ref. . The location of the quasiparticle peaks in the SIN conductance data are consistent with the ones in our earlier report and all of the data again display the cusp feature at zero bias. However, here we present a more exhaustive treatment of many junctions, with a wide range of junction conductance (∼0.1 mS-2 mS). We have also performed a more rigorous analysis of the SIN conductance data using two different models for the tunneling DOS with a d-wave gap. We again find good agreement with d-wave symmetry. Some of the SIN data display a weak dip feature at eV∼ 2∆. We have generated superconductor-insulator- superconductor (SIS) conductance curves using the SIN data. The resulting SIS curves display the characteristic dip features at nearly 3∆ that are consistent with those observed in the SIS tunneling conductance of Bi-2212. This is the first study to clearly indicate that the dip feature is present in the SIN conductance data of Tl-2201, but with a smaller magnitude than observed in Bi-2212. Further comparison with tunneling data of Bi-2212 reveals that while the bulk T c of Bi-2212 and Tl-2201 are approximately the same, the magnitude of the typical energy gap of Tl-2201 is smaller. The origin of this discrepancy is still unknown at present, but some insight has been gained with this study. We note first that the largest gaps found for the Tl-2201 (∆=25 meV) are close to those of Bi-2212 when both have the same T c =86 K. Furthermore, due to the strong dependence of the gap magnitude on doping concentration in Bi-2212, we suggest that the smaller gap values in Tl-2201 may be due to a surface that is slightly overdoped.","1"
"3446","PHC3200009-CC","7","Tl-2201 has a tetragonal crystal structure with a single Cu − O layer per unit cell which is relatively simple when compared to the bilayer and trilayer high-T c superconductors. However, Tl 2 Ba 2 Ca 2−n Cu 2 O 2n+3 (n=1, 2, and 3) family is very sensitive to thallium and oxygen content which influences the structure and superconducting properties. The optimally-doped compound of Tl-2201 has a T c of approximately 91 K and this value can be reduced to zero on the overdoped side by oxygen annealing. The Tl-2201 single crystals were grown from a flux in an alumina crucible with an alumina lid, sealed to avoid loss of thallium oxide. Tl 2 O 3 , BaO 2 and CuO powders were mixed at the atomic ratio of Tl:Ba:Cu=2.2:2:2 using excess Tl 2 O 3 and CuO as the flux. The crucibles, containing about 50 g of charge, were loaded in a vertical tube furnace and heated rapidly to 925-950 o C. This temperature was held for 1/2 hour. The furnace was then cooled at 5 o C/h to 875 o C, and finally cooled to room temperature. The crystals were platelet-shaped, with a basal plane area of about 1 mm 2 and a thickness along the c-axis varying between 20-100µm. The critical temperature of the samples is determined by ac magnetization measurements.","1"

In addition to this feature, tunneling measurements can also be performed in high magnetic fields, up to 6 T. The details of the measurement system can be found elsewhere. Cleaved single crystal samples of Tl-2201 usually have shiny surfaces in the a-b plane. Each is mounted on a substrate using an epoxy so that the tip approaches nominally along the c-axis. The electrical leads are connected to two sides of the sample by using silver paint. Non-superconducting Au is used as a counter-electrode.

"3449","PHC3200009-CC","10","In contrast to other surface sensitive experimental methods such as STM, ARPES, Raman, and auger techniques, the advantage of the point contact method for cuprates is that the tip can be used to scrape, clean, and in some cases cleave the surface. The tip often can penetrate through the surface and reach the bulk of the crystal. The cleaving of the surface sometimes results in the formation of SIS junctions, as in the case of Bi-2212. This happens when a piece of the HTS crystal attaches itself to the tip, forming an ohmic contact. As the tip is retracted, the piece forms an SIS break junction with the bulk crystal . Unlike Bi-2212, Tl-2201 has stronger bonds between planes and consequently SIS junctions could not be formed this way.","0"
"3450","PHC3200009-CC","11","Figure shows the conductances of eight junctions on three different Tl-2201 crystals, each with a bulk T c near 86 K. These junctions are representative of a larger set of data and they demonstrate several characteristics that are typical for PCT tunneling in Tl-2201. Each junction exhibits a single energy gap feature with conductance peaks at |V | = 20 − 25 mV. The voltage is that of the sample respect to the tip and thus negative bias corresponds to removal of electrons from the superconductor. There is a characteristic asymmetry in the conductance peaks such that the negative bias peak is higher than the one at positive bias. This type of asymmetry has also been seen in PCT and STM studies of Bi-2212, most consistently in overdoped samples. It has been pointed out that this conductance peak asymmetry may be a signature of the d-wave pairing. The background conductances for |eV | > ∆ are generally weakly decreasing with bias similar to that in Bi-2212, and it is these type of junctions that exhibit the largest peak height to background (PHB) ratio. A few junctions show a flat or slightly increasing background with a smaller PHB ratio. This implies that the decreasing background is an intrinsic property of the quasiparticle DOS. While such a feature may be due to the underlying band structure DOS, we note the absence of any van Hove singularity (VHS) in these data as well as earlier PCT data on Tl-2201. All of the junctions exhibit a cusp-like feature at zero bias which is characteristic of a d-wave DOS.","1"
"3451","PHC3200009-CC","12","The tunneling data are analyzed with two different methods. For Model I, the superconducting data are first normalized by constructing a ""normal state"" conductance obtained by fitting the high bias data to a third order polynomial. The normalized conductance data are compared to a weighted momentum averaged d-wave DOS, Here Γ is a lifetime broadening factor, f (θ), is an angular weighting function, and ∆(θ) = ∆ o cos(2θ) represents the d-wave gap symmetry expected from a mean-field BCS-type interaction. This model is used because it allows for a quick estimation of the gap value and as we will show, gives an excellent fit to the data. The inclusion of the weighting function allows for a better fit with the experimental data in the gap region than with the non-weighted average as was done previously. Here, a weighting function f (θ) = 1 + 0.4cos(4θ) was used which imposes a preferential angular selection of the DOS along the absolute maximum of the d-wave gap and tapers off towards the nodes of the gap. This is a rather weak directional function since the minimum of f (θ) along the nodes of the d-wave gap is still non-negligible.","0"
"3452","PHC3200009-CC","13","The second method (Model II) makes no attempt to normalize out any background conductance. Rather, an attempt is made to fit the entire spectrum by including a band structure, tunneling matrix element, and d-wave gap symmetry. The tunneling DOS is calculated using the single particle Green's function, For the superconducting state, where u 2 k and v 2 k are the usual coherence factors, Γ is the quasiparticle lifetime broadening factor, and k with the gap function for d-wave symmetry ∆(k) = ∆ o [cos(k x a) − cos(k y a)]/2 . The tunneling matrix element |T k | 2 is written as where v g is the group velocity defined as v g = |∇ k ξ k • n| and D(k) is the directionality function that has the form Here the unit vector n defines the tunneling direction, which is perpendicular to the plane of the junction, whereas θ o corresponds to the angular spread in k-space of the quasiparticle momenta with respect to n that has a non-negligible tunneling probability. The band structure for the Cu−O plane extracted from ARPES measurements on Bi-2212 is used. Presumably, other than the exact value of the chemical potential, the band structure for Tl-2201 should have the same generic features as the extracted band structure from Bi-2212. Unlike a similar analysis done in our earlier report, the presence of the VHS is not artificially removed by using a large chemical potential. Rather, the presence of the VHS is effectively diminished by the group velocity factor from the tunneling matrix element. Here, the value of the chemical potential has been altered slightly to produce the best comparison to the experimental data. The tunneling DOS from this model is compared directly to the experimental conductance data using a constant scaling factor. An interesting aspect of this second model is the robust asymmetric quasiparticle peaks in the tunneling DOS. This asymmetry, which has the higher peak in the filled states, is a direct consequence of the d-wave gap symmetry and directionality in the model. As will be shown, this result is consistent with our experimental tunneling data.","0"
"3453","PHC3200009-CC","14","Figures present two representative SIN tunneling conductances of Tl-2201. Figure shows Junction E of Fig. , while Figure is an additional conductance curve (Junction J) not shown in Fig. that has a very high peak height to background ratio. As illustrated in Figs. , the SIN conductance data consistently display the sharp, cusp-like subgap feature, weakly decreasing background, and conductance peaks that are either weakly or strongly asymmetric, with the higher peak on the negative bias side. The presence of these features and the overall shape of the conductance data are very similar to the conductance data of Fig. in our earlier report. To compare the two data sets to Model I, the SIN conductance data are first normalized by dividing through with an extrapolated normal state conductance curve which is shown as the solid line in Fig. . The normalized conductances are then compared to the DOS obtained from Model I as shown in Fig. . Other than a remaining conductance peak asymmetry and somewhat broader experimental peaks, the model DOS shows a remarkably good overall fit in the gap region with the experimental DOS. Notice that while the process of normalization has reduced the degree of asymmetry of the conductance peaks in both data sets, it has not eliminated it. This proves that the asymmetry is not a consequence of the background.","0"
"3454","PHC3200009-CC","15","The comparison of Model II with the unnormalized tunneling data is shown in Fig. . The most striking observation is the model's ability to reproduce the peak asymmetry that is seen in the data. As was shown in Ref. , this type of asymmetry with the higher peak in the filled states is a robust property of d-wave gap symmetry and directional tunneling. The strength of the directionality here is defined by θ o and the values used to compare both experimental data here are considerably larger than the ones used to analyze the Bi-2212 data. This implies that these two data sets are best fit with a weak directional tunneling processes which is consistent with the type of weighting function f (θ) in Model I.","0"
"3455","PHC3200009-CC","16","As in Bi-2212, Model II could not accurately reproduce the background conductance although it does show the generic decreasing background seen in both data sets. This may also be due to the fact that we are not using the exact normal state band structure for Tl-2201 in the model. Model II also produces a poorer agreement with the subgap data which might be due to the particular choice of directionality function used. Note that the values of the energy gap from both models are very close to each other, with the Model I having a slightly lower gap values than Model II.","0"
"3456","PHC3200009-CC","17","We would like to point out that attempts at comparing the normalized experimental data with just a pure d-wave gap symmetry without the f (θ) weighting function in the Model I led to a poorer fit to the data. Considering this, we reanalyze some of the SIN tunneling data from our previous report (Junction B and C in Fig. of Ref. and relabeled here as Junction B' and C' respectively). We have restricted this analysis by using only Model I. Figure shows the raw SIN conductance data of Junction B' and the estimated normal state conductance used to obtain the normalized data. This normalized curve is shown in Fig. along with the comparison to Model I. The model produces a better fit in the gap region (with identical gap value) when compared to our earlier fit.

In this case, the overall fit is only slightly improved over the one we reported earlier, with an identical gap value.","0"
"3457","PHC3200009-CC","18","One of the distinct features of the tunneling DOS in Bi-2212 is the strong dip beyond the quasiparticle peak in the occupied states. This feature is clearly seen in SIN conductance data of Bi-2212 from both STM and PCT. Furthermore, this dip feature is enhanced in the superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) junction. This is apparent from the break junction tunneling data in Ref. . Our SIN conductance data of Tl-2201 from this work and in our previous report do not seem to distinctively show the same dip features, although there is evidence of a weak dip feature in the normalized data of Figs. as well as junctions C and G in Fig. . We explore this issue further by generating SIS conductance curves from the raw data of Junction E and Junction B' which should enhance any dip feature that may exists in these SIN data. As shown in Fig. , both conductance data generate SIS curves that are qualitatively similar to the experimental SIS tunneling data of Bi-2212. Both curves clearly display the prominent dip features located at slightly less than 3∆. This indicates that the dip feature is also present in the SIN conductance data of Tl-2201 but at a smaller amplitude than the ones observed in the SIN data of Bi-2212.","0"
"3458","PHC3200009-CC","19","Another significant difference between the tunneling data of Bi-2212 and Tl-2201 is the magnitude of the supercon- ducting gap and this might be related to the dip feature discussed above. The optimally-doped Bi-2212 which has a T c of 93-95 K has an energy gap in the range of 37-38 meV. Due to the high reproducibility of the gap value for Bi-2212, it is presumed that the gap value for Bi-2212 is consistent with its T c . Tl-2201 which has a bulk T c of 86 K in this study and 91 K in the previous study, has an energy gap in the range of 19-25 meV. This value is considerably less than the energy gap of Bi-2212 even though bulk T c for both cuprates are roughly the same. This discrepancy raises an important question in HTS cuprates, namely the relationship between gap size ∆(T = 0) and T c . The unusual ∆ versus doping in Bi-2212, which violates mean-field theory, strongly suggest that T c is a phase coherence temperature. In this picture, there are strong superconducting fluctuations above T c and presumably the ability of each HTS to support such fluctuations depends on structural parameters, anistropy and the degree of 2-dimensionality. It is thus possible that there is no universal relationship between ∆ and T c for all HTS. If there exists a universal relationship between these two parameters for HTS cuprates as is approximately the case for conventional superconductors, then the difference in the gap size between these two HTS's needs another explanation. It is possible, due to the strength of the interplane bonding, that the tunneling measurement is probing predominantly the surface of the Tl-2201 crystals which has been exposed to air and may have properties different from the bulk. This raises the possibility that the surface of Tl-2201 may be slightly overdoped, which results in a smaller gap size. When Bi-2212 is annealed in air it has a T c ∼86 K and is slightly overdoped. This is the equilibrium oxygen doping level at atmospheric conditions and a similar situation is found for Tl-2201. Air annealed Tl-2201 has a T c ∼82 K. Therefore, air-exposed Tl-2201 will have a tendency for the surface to be somewhat overdoped by coming to equilibrium with atmospheric conditions. We are then suggesting that when the sample is cooled down to 4.2 K, there are no changes in the surface concentration. Of course we have no proof of this. If there are changes in the surface concentrations upon cooling in vacuum, then these changes are highly reproducible because both Bi-2212 and Tl-2201 display highly reproducible spectra and gap values.","1"
"3459","PHC3200009-CC","20","Furthermore, the strength of the dip feature seems to indicate that the surface is slightly overdoped. In Bi- 2212, tunneling conductances exhibiting gap sizes of 35-40 meV exhibit dip strength of approximately 80% of the background conductance. For smaller gaps in the range of 15-20 meV (which are from overdoped Bi-2212), the dip strength is approximately 10%. This is consistent with what is observed in Fig. for Tl-2201 and seems to support our argument that the surface of Tl-2201 crystals we measured is slightly overdoped. This however, is still speculation and requires further detailed study to account for the apparent gap size discrepancy. We note that preliminary temperature dependent data indicate that junctions which exhibit small gaps (∼ 20 meV) also show a strong smearing out of the gap feature at a temperature below the bulk T c.","0"
"3460","PHC3200009-CC","21","To summarize, we have performed SIN tunneling junction measurements on single crystals of Tl-2201 with bulk T c of 86 K. The conductance data obtained reproducibly show cusp-like subgap features, asymmetric conductance peaks and weakly decreasing backgrounds. These observations are consistent with our earlier report on Tl-2201 with a T c of 91 K that were synthesized in a different manner. The present data are fit reasonably well with two different models using the d-wave gap symmetry. The need for a weighting function in Model I and the prominent asymmetry of the data which is reproduced in Model II seem to indicate that the tunneling process in these cases may have a weak preferential tunneling direction centered at or near the absolute maximum of the d-wave gap. The magnitude of the superconducting gap for this cuprate is noticeably smaller than the gap size of optimally-doped Bi-2212 that has similar T c . The existence of a universal relationship between the superconducting gap size and T c is still undetermined, and therefore the origin of the discrepancy between the gap size of these two cuprates is still uncertain.","1"

"3475","PHC3411655-CC","9","Also, we have addressed the issue of the helium hydrostatic pressure. As the level of the liquid helium drops over the course of an experimental run, the pressure it exerts on the cavity decreases, causing the cavity to expand slightly. This re- sults in a constant drop in resonant frequency with time. In order to minimize this effect, it is necessary to isolate the cavity from the helium bath, while still maintaining a good thermal link between the two. To achieve this, we surround the resonant cavity with a vacuum jacket. Thermal links were maintained by direct surface-to-surface contact between the cavity and this outer cylin- der at certain points.

First, the rare-earth paramagnetism is stronger when H rf is applied in the plane. Thus, by changing the orientation we were able to significantly reduce the paramagnetic influence on our measurements. Secondly, the former orien- tation induced c-axis currents in the sample. This led to the simultaneous measurement of λ ab (T) and λ c (T), making it difficult to analyze the in- plane penetration depth without c-axis contribu- tions. However, with H rf now applied parallel to the c-axis, only a-b plane currents are induced. This allows for a direct measurement of λ ab (T).","0"

This, along with their reasonable values of T c, indicates that the doping is near optimal levels. There- fore, the low temperature behavior of the pene- tration depth for these samples should be repre- sentative of the electron-doped cuprate supercon-ductors, with minimal extrinsic influences. This is in contrast to the behavior of other crystals which displayed much broader transitions as well as step-like features in R S (T), indicative of ad- ditional superconducting transitions.

A structural unit of cation-layers is stacked in a sequence of -HgO-BaO-CuO-Ca-along the c-axis. The substitution of Hg by Pb enhances the stability of the Hg-1223 phase because the high steam pressure of Hg lowers the chemical stability in synthesis. However, the doping into Hg layers is related to an interstitial oxygen defect. On the other hand, the substitution of Ba by Sr improves the hole doping of CuO2 planes. Thus, the element substitution in Hg and Ba sites becomes a key factor in synthesizing high-quality superconductors. Therefore, the cation distribution in the two sites has been examined by the two- wavelengths anomalous dispersion (TWAD) method of synchrotron X-ray resonant scattering. Single crystals of Hg-1223 were grown at T = 1130 K by the liquid-assisted solid-state recrystallization method from the precursor powder prepared by spray drying or evaporation of the nitrate solutions. Oxygen contents in the precursors were determined by iodometric titrations. Four samples of Hg0.45Pb0.30Ba1.63Sr0.50Ca1.94Cu3O8 ( Tc = 128 K), Hg0.42Pb0.41Ba1.19Sr1.06Ca1.97Cu3O8 (125 K), Hg0.50Pb0.50Ba0.59Sr1.24Ca1.83Cu3.34O8 (116 K) and Hg0.34Pb0.54Ba0.61Sr1.17Ca1.88Cu3O8 (115 K) were selected for single- crystal intensity measurements.

The optimal T c in Hg-2212 system is 82-84 K . This value can only be reached by chemical stabilization of the oxygen-deficient double mercury layer. The oxygen vacancies content in Hg 2 Ba 2 YCu 2 O 8−δ is already around δ = 0.4-0.5 and increases by Ca doping, up to its solubility limit x = 0.40. To further rise doping, stabilizing elements like Tl 3+ or Pb 4+ (8; 9) have to be used in substitution of Hg 2+ : these higher valency el- ements bring oxygen in the double (Hg/Pb or Tl) 2 O 2−δ layer and then allow to further substitute Y by Ca.","1"

At this point, it is important to note that the chemical reactions take place into an inert and closed capsule, i.e. into a confined system.

"3659","PHC4020152-CC","8","In the second route we attempted to better control the oxidation state of the sample by adjusting the oxygen content of the precursor introduced into the closed capsule to the desired value. This second method, used for series II, allows to control more precisely the oxygen stoichiometry before the HP-HT reaction and then the final doping state of the synthesized Hg-2212 com- pound. It consists in intimately mixing HgO directly in the right proportion with BaO 2 , SrCuO 2 , Y 2 O 3 , Ca 2 CuO 3 oxides and metallic Cu (Ventron, 99 %) to have the nominal Hg 2 (Ba 1−y Sr y ) 2 (Y 0.80 Ca 0.20 )Cu 2 O 7.50 composition, with y = 0 -0.25 by step of 0.05, then 0.40, 0.50, 0.70 and 1.0. For example, in the case of Hg 2 (Ba 0.75 Sr 0.25 ) 2 (Y 0.80 Ca 0.20 )Cu 2 O 8−δ , to reach an oxygen con- tent of 7.50, we used the mixture 2 HgO, 1.5 BaO 2 , 0.5 SrCuO 2 , 0.4 Y 2 O 3 , 0.1 Ca 2 CuO 3 and 1.4 Cu. BaO 2 was chosen as the barium source instead of BaCuO 2 because it is very difficult to prepare BaCuO 2 without any trace of carbon contamination. The 95 % purity of the commercial BaO 2 , which con- tains traces of barium carbonate, was also not considered sufficient. Our source of barium peroxide was prepared by precipitation of a solution of barium ni- trate (more pure, Aldrich, 99 %) added with oxygenated water. The absence of barium hydroxide, carbonate or oxide hydrate was checked by XRD in the final BaO 2 product. SrCuO 2 was prepared by firing SrCO 3 and CuO under oxygen flow at 950˚C for 48 h followed by a second treatment at 980˚C for 36 h with an intermediate grinding. Ca 2 CuO 3 was synthesized by reacting a mixture of 2 CaCO 3 (Aldrich, 99 %) + CuO at 1000˚C under oxygen flow for 15 h. The purity of these two oxides was checked by XRD before their mixing and the HP-HT treatment.","0"

EDX microanalyses made systematically on samples of both series (SEM observations) show that this phase contains mainly Hg and Sr. It could also incorporate Cu or Ca in few amounts but the conclusion on this point is not definitive.

First, the EDX results show that Sr and Ba contents vary in opposite way: the Sr content in- creases regularly when the Ba content decreases, and more precisely, the ratio of contents Sr/(Sr+Ba) determined by EDX is close to the nominal Sr content in all samples. Secondly, the T c rise is regular and continuous. If Sr 2+ /Y 3+ site substitution would have been involved in this T c rise, this would have resulted in an over-stoichiometry of Sr. Moreover, this over-stoichiometry should have increased regularly to explain the T c increase. None of those phenomena is observed. Thirdly, if one assumes that Sr 2+ goes on the Y 3+ site and that its occupancy factor increases, for steric considerations one would observe an increase of the c-axis (the ionic radius of Sr 2+ being larger than Y 3+ in the eight-fold coordination), or at least a levelling of the shrinkage of the c-axis.

This point is clearer in the series II, where the oxygen control was more accurate (mixture of oxides and metallic Cu with a total oxygen content of O 7.50) than in series I (mixture of HgO with precursors whose oxygen content is not well defined).","0"

Hence these samples were indexed in tetragonal structure (space group P4/mmm) with indexing [013] and [110] for the main peaks. Lattice parameters a, b and c are listed in Table 1 for all the samples. Resistance versus temperature (R vs. T) plots for Y 0.4 Pr 0.6 Ba 2-x Sr x Cu 3 O 7 (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1) samples are shown in Fig. 2. The x = 0.0 sample is semiconducting down to 2 K, for which the R 2K /R 300K ratio is nearly 65, which is in agreement with previous reports [1-7]. The x = 0.20 and 0.40 samples also exhibit semiconductor like behaviour but with somewhat reduced R 2K /R 300 ratios of nearly 23 and 5, respectively. This implies that the conduction improves significantly after substitution of Sr at the Ba site in this system. For x = 0.60 sample, the normal state conduction is mostly metallic in nature with a slight upturn before the superconducting onset (T c onset ) at around 20 K. The samples with x = 0.80 and 1.0, exhibits metallic behavior i n the entire temperature range between room temperature and T c onset . Further these two samples show zero resistance state at T c (R=0) of around 5 K and 14 K, respectively. Thus one infers from Fig. 2, that both room temperature conductivity and normal state (above T c onset ) conduction process of Y 0.4 Pr 0.6 Ba 2-x Sr x Cu 3 O 7 system improves with increasing Sr concentration. Room temperature resistivity ( ρ 290K ) values of the Y 0.4 Pr 0.6 Ba 2-x Sr x Cu 3 O 7 system for various x values are given in Table 1, and are found to systematically decrease with increase in x. Eventually, superconductivity is induced by Sr substitution at Ba site in Y 0.4 Pr 0.6 Ba 2-x Sr x Cu 3 O 7 system.","1"

With increasing applied field, though the T c onset remains nearly constant, T c (R=0) could not be observed even for small magnetic field of 0.005 Tesla.

This sample shows T c (R=0) of 14 K with T c onset at around 32 K Under applied magnetic fields of up to 0.50 Tesla, the T c (R=0) decreases but T c onset is nearly unchanged.

The results of thermoelectric power (S) measurements on Y 0.4 Pr 0.6 Ba 2-x Sr x Cu 3 O 7 (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1) samples are shown in Fig. . The value of S at room temperature (S 290K ) is found to be positive for all the samples, indicating them to be predominantly hole (p) type conductors. Also the value of S 290K decreases monotonically with increasing x (Table 1) implying that the number of mobile p - type carriers increases with increasing x in Y 0.4 Pr 0.6 Ba 2-x Sr x Cu 3 O 7 system. For strongly correlated systems, the absolute value of S is known to be inversely proportional to the number of mobile carriers .

"3702","PHC4170033-CC","17","It has been observed earlier that when bigger size Ba ion is substituted by relatively smaller size Sr ion in any RE: 123 system, oxygen vacancies are created in CuO 1-δ chains giving rise to reduced orthorhombicity. Also the smaller size of Sr in comparison to Ba warrants a lower c- lattice parameter of the system with progressive substitution. Hence the decrease of both orthorhombicity and c-lattice parameter of the Y 0.4 Pr 0.6 Ba 2-x Sr x Cu 3 O 7 with increasing x is on expected lines. It has been observed from neutron diffraction studies that though there is an overall decrease in the c-lattice parameter of the system, the CuO 2 -RE-CuO 2 superconducting block opens up by increasing RE-O(2) distance and the CuO 1-δ -SrO-CuO 2 block squeezes. The effect is shown more clearly in with the help of a schematic unit cell of RE:123.

The Pr substitution at the RE site in RE:123 compounds destroys superconductivity and brings about an insulating normal state by basically localizing the mobile hole carriers in conducting CuO 2 planes . Localization of carriers happens due to induced disorder in CuO 2 planes . The cause of such a disorder could be either Pr and Ba-sites intermixing in the structure or the hybridization of extended Pr(4f) with the O(2p) orbital in CuO 2 planes .","0"

An increase in RE-O 2 distance will result in a decrease of Pr(4f) hybridization with O(2p) orbital. Our results clearly demonstrated that the Sr substitution at Ba-site de-localizes the carriers and induces superconductivity in a systematic way in the insulating Y 0.4 Pr 0.6 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 system. Critical concentration of Pr i.e. (x cr ) depends upon the extent of Pr(4f) hybridization with O(2p). Higher concentration of Pr i s needed to suppress superconductivity in a given Y/Pr:123 system if the hybridization of Pr(4f) is relatively weak with O(2p) [20]. For example, x cr is higher for Y/Pr:124 (Y 1-x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 4 O 7 ) than Y/Pr:123 due to weaker Pr(4f)-O(2p) hybridization in the former.","0"

The reason is that while Sr substitution for Ba helps in de-localizing the carriers by decreasing Pr(4f) hybridization with CuO 2 planes, the same also decreases the overall number of carriers, being similar to that as for YBa 2-x Sr x Cu 3 O 7 system, due to decreased oxygen content. Further, it is not possible to replace Ba completely by Sr with normal pressure heat treatments. In fact, one can synthesize compounds like YSr 2 Cu 3 O 7 with HPHT (High Pressure High Temperature) solid -state reaction route , with superconducting T c of up to 80 K.

Even though the power was supplied at a constant rate by the power supply, the actual heating power of the sample fluctuated because R heater changed during the synthe- sis; ∆R heater /R heater ∼ 0.1.

"3762","PHC3660299-CC","18","The choice of R was rather reasonable because the largest grains found in the SEM images on many cleaved surfaces have R max ∼ 7.5 µm, which guarantees the cor- rect order of magnitude of our J c value. Also this J c value was nearly same order of magnitude as that ob- tained for powders using a sieve with the average size R ≃ 3 µm . The high-T c cuprate superconductors have strongly 2-dimensional characters, short coherence length, and 'high' T c . Due to these, vortex lines become ill-defined and transform into pancake vortices confined within the CuO 2 planes, which couple only weakly be- tween the layers. Thus the critical current density suf- fers great decrease at higher temperatures due to the flux flow driven by a strong thermal fluctuation effect. There are several extrinsic methods to enhance J c . Correlated defect was known to increase the pinning at higher tem- peratures and high fields while point defects have been known to be efficient only at low temperature and low fields . The former such as columnar defects gen- erated by heavy-ion irradiation not only increases just pinning centers but also could be thought to increase the coupling between vortices along the irradiated trajectory. This is because the relatively strong pinning centers are produced along straight line across CuO 2 plane. The be- havior of J c of La-112 here resembles the former case, namely the critical current density does not decays fast as temperature and field increases. For example, at T ∼ T c/2, J c decreases by much less than factor of 2 when the field is increased from 1 and 4.5 Tesla, which is just typical behavior expected for Bean's critical state model . Correlated defects are generally inserted into the sample on purpose, surely absent in our samples. All these arguments suggest that the behavior of J c of our sample is highly intrinsic because Jorgensen et al. showed that defects, most probably the oxygen defects and va- cancies, do not exist for this compound .","0"
"3763","PHC3660299-CC","19","The samples studied here were made with in-situ an- nealing and showed that the nearly uniform-sized grains were separated well from each other by wide cracks. The uniform size made the superconducting transition sharp in the low-field magnetization, and the cracks made the resistivity drop in the transport measurement nearly in- visible. Actually we tried to make samples without in- situ annealing after sintering. This sample showed many smaller grains between larger grains, which resulted in broad superconducting transition in the low-field mag- netization but with a clearer resistivity drop due to a better connectivity between the grains. These suggest that the use of grain radius not the sample radius is rea- sonable for the calculation of J c like the previous report . The different J c values between us and previous re- sult seems to be partly due to the uniformness of the grain size and/or the existence of many smaller grains. Now let's compare the above values with those of com- pounds having a charge reservoir block, whose average distance between CuO 2 planes is larger. Optimally doped (La,Sr) 2 CuO 4 and (Nd,Ce) 2 CuO 4 are the most suitable for comparison with our electron-doped infinite-layer su- perconductors because the former has nearly the same T c as our sample while the latter is an electron-doped cuprate superconductor similar to ours.","0"

As for the Nd-214 compound, the reported J c ≃ 8 × 10 5 A/cm 2 at 4.2 K and 0 T was obtained using a form of only a thin film not a bulk, so a direct comparison is impossible. However, if the fact that the J c of high-T c cuprates de- creases by nearly one order of magnitude when the mag- netic field is increased from 0 to ∼ 5 T is considered, the intragranular critical current density of La-112 should be much larger than that of Nd-214.","0"

The resemblance of the electronic nature with possible strong fluctuations of this frustrated lattice to that of high-T c oxides is emphasized by several authors , and a possibility of the triplet pairing is also conceived by other groups. In the previous report, the present authors ha ve shown by Co-NQR studies of the system, that the coherence peak of the 59 Co-nuclear spin relaxation rate 1/T 1 observed by NQR exists just below T c even though it is much smaller than that expected for ordinary s-wave superconductors. We have also reported the NMR Knight shift observed for a peak of the NMR spectra, corresponding to the crystallites oriented with their y-axes within the c-planes being parallel to the external magnetic field H. Based on these results, we have pointed out that the superconducting pairs can probably be considered to be in the singlet state, unless we do not consider a situation where spins of triplet pairs are pinned along the direction perpendicular to the y-axis. We have also pointed out that the symmetry may be s-like or fully gapped one and added that other kinds of symmetry, ( d+id)-symmetry, for example, cannot be excluded. Even if the symmetry is s-like, it does not necessarily indicate that the superconductivity is not exotic, because the s-like symmetry or the fully gapped state may be realized by the pairing mediated by the interband excitations of the electrons. Another possible way to study the pair symmetry is to examine an effect of the impurity-doping on the superconducting transition temperature of the system: The pair breaking effect of nonmagnetic impurities is negligible in ordinary s-wave superconductors, while it can be large as in the case of magnetic impurities in usual s-wave superconductors, if the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter has nonzero angular momentum l as the p-or d-wave one. For nonzero l, the absolute initial slope |dT c /dx| is proportional to the scattering rate 1/τ of the electrons by the impurities.","0"

The lattice parameter c determined by the X-ray studies changed systematically with x for M=Ir, which guarantees that the substitution is successfully carried out. For M=Ga, the lattice parameter c exhibits rather large scattering as a function of x. However, because it shows, roughly speaking, a decreasing tendency with increasing x and because the resistivity ρ and the transition temperature T c of the system exhibit, as shown later, systematic x dependence, it can be considered that the substitution is carried out. (In the actual experiments, besides M=Ir and Ga, several atomic elements such as Cu and Al, for example, were tried to substitute for Co. But, we could not find a firm experimental evidence that these elements really substitute for Co:  The lattice parameter did not show systematic dependence on the nominal value x. The absolute value and the T-dependence of the resistivity ρ did not change systematically with x, either. (The superconduting transition temperature was almost independent of the nominal values of x.)  Then, the obtained data of the doping dependence of T c on x are, we think, reliable only for M=Ir and Ga. (For M=Rh, the data may also be reliable.) and here these data are presented. We employed a ""rapid heat-up"" technique to avoid the Na evaporation.

Because the data do not indicate the increase of the number of magnetic moments with increasing x, the impurities can be considered to be non-magnetic, which is naturally expected, because non-magnetic Co atoms are substituted with the isoelectronic Ir atoms or with Ga atoms which have only s and p outer electrons. If the superconducting gap parameter has the s-wave symmetry, T c should not, in an ideal case, be suppressed by the present doping. It is interesting to compare the values of |dT c /dx| with those of other systems. In Fig. 14, we summarize the T c -x curves obtained in the present experiments together with those of well known systems, La 1.85 Sr 0.15 Cu 1-x Zn x O 4 26) with the d-wave order parameter and Mg(B 1-x C x ) 2 with the s-wave one. 27) The slopes |dT c /dx| observed for the present sample series have the values similar to that of the Mg(B 1-x C x ) 2 system and much smaller than that of La 1.85 Sr 0.15 Cu 1-x Zn x O 4 . It may be also useful to note that the values of |dT c /dx| observed for the spinel system Cu(Co 1-x M x ) 2 S 4 are ~0.9 and ~0.6, for M=Rh and Ir, respectively. 28) The system is considered to have the s-wave order parameter from the existence of a significant coherence peak in the T-dependence of the nuclear relaxation rate divided by T, 1/T 1 T. 29) It has the three dimensional network of the corner-sharing (Co 1-x M x ) 4 and can be considered to be a three dimensional version of the triangular lattice. For this system, |dT c /dx| is more than a half of that of Na z Co 1-x Ir x O 2 ⋅yH 2 O. From these results, it is tempting to consider that the present system has the s-wave order parameter and that the linear relationship between T c and x is just caused by a mechanism different from the pair breaking due to the scattering by non-magnetic impurities. On the other hand, within the framework of the pair breaking theory, the relations {T c (0)-T c (x)} ~πh/4ηk B τ~π 2 T c (0)α(x)/4~0.44π 2 (ξ/Λη)×T c (0) hold in the region of small x (Note that ξ×T c (0) does not depend on T c (0). ). To explain the initial slope |dT c /dx| ~1 K/%, ξ/(Λη)= hv F /{1.76πk B T c (0)}/( v F τ) should be of the order of ~1/20. If ξ is chosen to be ~100 Å, 10) Λ has to be as large as 1000 Å at x=0.01, which seems to be too large as compared with the average separation of neighboring impurities (~30 Å). The much smaller values of |dT c /dx| for the present systems than that of La 1.85 Sr 0.15 Cu 1-x Zn x O 4 do not seem to be easily understood only by the naive consideration of the pair breaking by non-magnetic impurities, either Then, what is the primary mechanism of the observed T c suppression? It is, roughly speaking, to be linear in x, but the rate |dT c /dx| seems to be too small to understand by the pair breaking mechanism. We may have to ask why Cu(Co 1-x M x ) 2 S 4 with the s-symmetry of the order parameter exhibits the linear T c -decrease in x, 28) because the similar origin of the T c suppression may be relevant to the present case. For example, effects of the carrier localization on T c may be considered as one of possible origins, because for M=Ir, the relatively small amount of the doping to the host material Na z' CoO 2 seems to induce the upturn of the resistivity with decreasing T (see Figs. 2 and 6). Before summarizing the results of the present study, we also add followings. 30) The Knight shifts K y studied as functions of T at several fixed H values (1.5 T ≤ H ≤ 4.5 T) indicate that the spin susceptibility decreases with decreasing T below T c . The H-and T-dependences of K y cannot be explained by considering the superconducting diamagnetism, as reported in our previous paper. 8) The magnetic field H c2 determined from the T dependence of K y reproduces the H c2 -T curve for H applied within the c plane reported in ref. 10. The H c2 value at T→0 can be understood by the effect of the Zeeman splitting on singlet pairs, indicating again that the superconducting pairs are definitely in the singlet state. It gives a restriction that the pairs have even parity. In order to fully understand the observed values of |dT c /dx|, we have to examine various quantities and study the electronic state of the present system in detail. In summary, we have presented the results of the studies on the impurity-doping effects on T c of Na z CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O and shown that the values of |dT c /dx| are ~1 K/%, which is too small to be explained by the pair breaking mechanism for the anisotropic (l≠0) order parameters by non-magnetic impurities.","0"

In particular, unconventional su- perconductivity has been expected in this compound be- cause of the unique crystal structure in the CoO 2 layer al- though the superconducting transition temperature T c ≃ 5 K is one order of magnitude smaller than that in High-T c copper oxide superconductors. The CoO 2 layer is formed by the hexagonal arrangement of the Co ions, which is in contrast to the tetragonal arrangement of the Cu ions in the copper oxides. A deficiency of the sodium atom leads to dope 0.65 holes into the layer of the insu- lating low-spin (S = 0) state of Co +3 . This hole doping results in 0.35 electrons doped in the triangular lattice consisting of S = 1/2 of Co +4 . Such triangular magnetic lattice is regarded as having magnetic frustration and one may expect that unconventional superconductivity is realized on the basis of such frustration. Then just af- ter finding the superconductivity in the present material, many theoretical proposals of possible unconventional superconductivity have been presented. The exper- imental investigation on the superconductivity, however, has not progressed so much because of difficulty of get- ting the single crystal. It is highly desirable to obtain the basic superconducting parameters in magnetic field, for example, the upper critical field H c2 , the coherence length ξ, and those anisotropy.

The typical size of the single crystal is 1 × 0.6 × 0.02 mm 3 . The in- plane resistivity was measured by standard dc four probe method. In order to make the electrical contact to the sample, the gold wires (10 µmφ) were attached with sil- ver paste which dried for 30 minutes at a few C • .

For instance, the samples were placed on the aluminum plate cooled by ice during the preparation of the electrical contact under micro- scope.

The origin of the difference is not known at present, but the metallic behavior in the in- plane resistivity observed by Chou et al. and us seems to be intrinsic nature because no anomaly in magnetic sus- ceptibility mentioned latter and specific heat has been reported at the temperature. The temperature dependence of the magnetic suscep- tibility χ in another single crystal from the same batch is shown in the inset. Around 45 K, an anomaly appears as a cusp of χ, which has been reported in the single crystal sample by Chou et al., but has not been observed in the powder sample. The origin of the anomaly is likely to be the residual oxygen on the surface or in the intercalated water because the large number of purging the sample space of the magnetometer by helium gas at room temperature strongly suppresses the anomaly. The Curie-Weiss like enhancement of χ at low temperature is reduced also by such sufficient gas exchange. The dif- ference of the Curie-Weiss like enhancement by purging appears only below the temperature of the cusp anomaly. Therefore the anomaly of χ around 45 K and some part of the Curie-Weiss like enhancement of χ can be consid- ered to come from the extrinsic origin which is probably due to the residual oxygen. It is noted, however, that the Curie-Weiss like enhancement becomes remaining even after sufficient number of purging. It suggests that some part of the enhancement is free from the residual oxygen and may result from a magnetic fluctuation origin. 7)","0"

Theses values of the slope are in agreement with the previous reports. 8, 10) From these initial slopes, the Ginzburg -Landau coherence length ξ can be calculated by using the relation , where Φ 0 = hc/2e = 2.07 × 10 −11 T•cm 2 and i, j, and k are cyclic permutations of the directions. Here we assume the isotropic ξ in the ab-plane, that is ξ i = ξ j = ξ ab and ξ k = ξ c . Following the equations the coherence lengths are calculated to be ξ ab ≃ 12 nm and ξ c ≃ 1.3 nm. It is noted that the interlayer coherence length ξ c is longer than the interlayer spacing, about 0.98 nm, of the CoO 2 layers. 1) Accordingly the anisotropy calculated from ξ is about 9.2, which may be a lower limit value of the anisotropy considering the experimental uncertainty de- scribed before. This moderate size of the anisotropy is almost comparable to that of the pyridine intercalated transition metal dicalcogenides (∼ 20), organics (∼ 10) and Sr 2 RuO 4 (∼ 20) and is larger than that of the alkali intercalated nitrides (∼ 4). In compar- ison with the High-T c copper oxides, the anisotropy of the present cobalt oxide is located between the value of YB 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ and the La-based cuprates. One may ex- pect larger anisotropy than the observed value because of expanding largely the interlayer spacing between the CoO 2 layers by intercalation of H 2 O molecules. But it is much smaller than that of the Bi-based cuprates. The reason may be due to longer interlayer coherence length than the interlayer spacing of the CoO 2 layers.

In the magnetic field parallel to the c-axis, the H c c2 (T ) line looks likely to be pointing to H WHH c2 (0). On one hand, H ab c2 (T ) is strongly suppressed from H WHH c2 (0) in the low temperature region. This suppression may arise from the singlet pair breaking by Zeeman effect, that is so-called Clogston-Chandrasekhar limit or Pauli paramagnetic limit. The value of Pauli paramagnetic limit is simply described as H P = 1.84T c . According to T c = 4.5 K, H P ≃ 8.3 T. As can be seen in , the actual H ab c2 (T ) line seems to be suppressed from H WHH c2 (0) to H P . Such suppression by Zeeman effect may suggest the spin singlet superconductivity in the present cobalt oxide superconductor.","0"

(iii) All of the Cu sites are equivalent, and only the CuO 2 plane is responsible for the electric conduction. Here we report on measurements and analyses of Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 1−x Er x Cu 2 O 8 single crystals with x=0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0. We have found that ρ c /ρ ab for a parent AF insulator (x=1.0) is quite unique; it increases with T below 100 K, takes a broad maximum near 300 K, and decreases above room temperature. This obviously indicates that a parent AF insulator exhibits a quite different conduction mechanism from conventional semiconductors.","0"

The measured compositions, sizes, and c-axis lattice parameters are listed in table 1. We should note that crystals grown by a flux method are produced with little stress, owing to the slow cooling rate near thermal equilibrium. In fact, we did not observe any serious cracks in the SEM images of our samples.

We therefore propose that holes are confined in a CuO 2 plane in the presence of the 2D spin fluctuation, which occurs irrespective of doping levels. As the 3D AF order grows below T N , the confinement becomes less effective. A recent numerical analysis of the bilayer t − J model has also led to the assertion that ρ c is substantially modified in the presence of the 2D spin fluctuation . We further note that a similar case is seen for a layered ferromagnet La 2−x Sr 1+x Mn 2 O 7 . For 100 K < T < 250 K, this compound is in a 2D ferromagnetic state, and exhibits a non-metallic ρ c together with a metallic ρ ab .

"3844","JPS0722453-CC","7","The positions of the peaks and shoulders of the 59 Co-NMR spectra observed for both kinds of samples were well explained by considering the anisotropic Knight shifts K x ≠ K y ≠ K z ≠ K x and the effects of electric quadrupole interaction up to the second order. The directions of the principal axes of Knight shift are assumed to be same as those of the electric quadrupole interaction. In the present case, the z-axis was defined along the direction, for which the component of the electric quadrupole tensor, ν zz is larger than the other components. This z direction was found to be along the c-axis by fitting the positions of calculated spectra to those of aligned sample.

To explain this puzzle, we consider that the shift K y observed in ref. for a sample aligned in epoxy adhesive (Stycast) also exhibits the T-independent behavior. We think that the specimens embedded in the Stycast have somewhat different properties from those of the (non-aligned) samples.

It has been confirmed by the following experimental observation.

Then, the precise calculation of the amplitude of the coherence peak is required to exclude such the symmetry. Even for the p-wave state predicted in refs. 14 and 15, the decrease of K spin ,y can be expected, if the direction of the triplet spins is pinned in the direction perpendicular to the y-axis.

"3857","JPS0710709-CC","2","A class of metal oxides isostructural to mineral pyrochlore has been attracting consid- erable attention because they exhibit a wide variety of interesting physical properties. The pyrochlore has a general formula of A 2 B 2 O 7 , consisting of BO 6 octahedra and eightfold coordinated A cations, where A and B are transition metals and/or rare-earth elements. In particular, the B sublattice can be viewed as a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra, providing a testing ground for studying the role of geometrical frustration in sys- tems which have local spins at B sites with antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation. Such systems are known to remain frustrated even when the exchange interaction is ferromagnetic (FM), provided that the spin correlation has local Ising anisotropy. Recent studies have revealed a rich variety of phenomena seemingly related to the geometrical frustration, such as the occurrence of a spin-glass (SG) phase in R 2 Mo 2 O 7 with R=Y, Tb and Dy , the unusual behavior of ordinary and anomalous Hall coefficients in the same compound with R=Nd, Sm and Gd , and the ""spin-ice"" phase in R 2 Ti 2 O 7 with R=Dy and Ho. Although metallic pyrochlores comprise a minority subgroup of the pyrochlore family, they consist of distinct members such as Tl 2 Mn 2 O 7 , which exhibits colossal magnetoresis- tance. Moreover, the recently revealed superconductivity in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 , a 5d transition metal pyrochlore , demonstrates that the pyrochlores provide a fertile field for elec- tronic correlation adjacent to the perovskite compounds.  In this context, it is noteworthy that LiV 2 O 4 , a cubic spinel compound in which the V sublattice is isostructural to the B sublattice in pyrochlore, behaves similarly to a heavy fermion metal. It is reported that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 falls into the bulk superconducting state below T c ≃ 1 ∼ 2 K, as confirmed by a large jump of specific heat ∆C c as well as large diamagnetism due to the Meissner effect associated with the occurrence of zero resistivity. The dc magnetization curve indicates that the superconductivity is of type II with the upper critical field close to 0.29 T at 0 K. The ratio ∆C c /γT c (with γ being the Sommerfeld constant) is reported to be 1.15, which is smaller than the predicted value of 1.43 for isotropic BCS superconductors. Unfortunately, these measurements were performed only above 0.4 K and are thus inconclusive in determining the detailed characteristics of superconductivity in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . In this Letter, we report on the quasiparticle excitations in the mixed state of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 studied by muon spin rotation/relaxation (µSR). The magnetic penetration depth λ, which reflects the population of normal electrons (""quasiparticles"") in the superconductive state, is determined microscopically by measuring the muon spin relaxation due to the spatial inhomogeneity of magnetic induction in the flux line lattice (FLL). We show that the temperature dependence of λ is more or less consistent with the prediction based on the BCS superconductors with an isotropic gap, although a slight discrepancy is suggested by the detailed analysis.","1"

These equations indi- cate that the real amplitude of the Fourier-transformed muon precession signal corresponds to the local field distribution n(B). The local field distribution can be approximated as the sum of magnetic induction from isolated vortices in the London model to yield where K is a translation of the vortex reciprocal lattice, B 0 (≃ H) is the average internal field, λ is the London penetration depth, and ξ v is the cutoff parameter. The term O(K 2 x , K 2 y ) denotes the nonlocal effect in which the electromagnetic response kernel Q(K) generating the supercurrent around the vortex depends on K. While this term is eliminated in the conventional BCS superconductors with isotropic s-wave pairing, it becomes important for the moe complex order parameters such as anisotropic s-wave or d-wave (e.g., d x 2 −y 2 ).

According to the empirical two-fluid model approximately valid for conventional BCS superconductors, we have which leads to where t ≡ T /T c (0.1 T). The fitting analysis by the same formula with an arbitrary power, with T c as a free parameter yields β = 2.8and T c = 0.65(3) K. We also found that T c = 0.62(1) K when β = 4 is assumed, which is slightly lower than the value T c ≃ 0.7 K estimated from the specific heat measurement for this field.

Thus, it is concluded that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is a typical type II superconductor with large λ, which is consistent with the results of magnetization measurement. The finding that β ≃ 2.8 may indicate that the deviation ∆λ = λ(t)−λ(0) ∝ T β exhibits a tendency predicted for the case of line nodes (d-wave pairing) with some disorder (i.e., dirty limit), where ∆λ ∝ T 2 .","0"

However, the result of the fitting analysis also suggests that the discrepancy may be attributed to experimental uncertainty including the precise value of T c .

Since the deduced value of H c2 is consistent with that obtained from the magnetization measurement (≃ 0.29 T), we can conclude that the observed field dependence of λ is mostly due to the vortex core/overlap effect, except for the fields below ∼0.06 T where a slightly steeper reduction of σ is suggested.","0"

In general, the field dependence of λ is enhanced by two different mechanisms, i.e., the nonlinear effect in the semiclassical Doppler shift of the quasiparticle energy levels due to the supercurrent around the vortex cores, and the nonlocal effect which further modifies the quasiparticle excitation spectrum in the momentum space. In particular, the nonlocal effect is important in the system with line nodes because the coherence length is inversely proportional to the order parameter, such that ξ 0 (k) =hv F /π∆k. The divergence of ξ 0 along the nodal directions |∆k| = 0 means that the response of quasiparticles near the nodes is highly nonlocal. It is predicted that η ≪ 1 for the isotropic s-wave pairing because the finite gap prevents the shifted levels of quasiparticle excitations from being occupied at low temperatures. This is supported, for example, by the recent observation in CeRu 2 , in which η ≃ 0 over the field region 0 ≤ h ≤ 0.5 where the system behaves more or less as a conventional BCS superconductor with isotropic s-wave pairing. [21] On the other hand, stronger field depen- dence is predicted for the case of d-wave or anisotropic s-wave pairing due to the excess population of quasiparticles in the region where |∆k| is small or zero. Typical examples for the d-wave pairing are those of high-T c cuprates in which η is reported to be 5∼6.6 for YBCO. Meanwhile, in the case of an s-wave superconductor YNi 2 B 2 C in which strong anisotropy for ∆k is suggested experimentally , η ≃ 1 is reported from a µSR study. The comparison of these earlier results with our result suggests that the anisotropy of the order parameter in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is considerably smaller than YNi 2 B 2 C.","0"

Stripes in high-T c cuprates form a peri- odic pattern of charge and spin rivers running along the tetragonal [100] or [010] directions (parallel to the Cu-O bonds). The signature of stripes is most significant in La 2 CuO 4-based cuprates. In the prototypical cuprates a pronounced suppression of superconductivity is observed due to the formation of static stripes when the doping level is close to a magic number x = 1/8 and/or when the crystal has a low temperature tetragonal (LTT) struc- ture . The former is attributed to commensurability of the stripe pattern with the lattice. The latter is due to a tilting of the CuO 6 octahedron towards in the LTT phase, which stabilizes the formation of charge and spin channels running along the [100] direction.","0"

In this work, we propose uniaxial pressure as a novel and promising control parameter to explore the critical region of the stripe-superconductivity phase boundary, which provides by far richer information than the conventional hydrostatic pressure and therefore is distinct. The stripes in high-T c cuprates are one-dimensional self-organized objects formed within the two-dimensional CuO 2 plane and, therefore, a strong coupling with an anisotropic dis- tortion of the tetragonal CuO 2 plane is anticipated. The fact that the stripes are stabilized in the presence of LTT distortion along [100] can be understood in terms of such a coupling. Hydrostatic pressure is essentially a volume effect and cannot generate any anisotropic dis- tortion. Uniaxial pressure, on the other hand, produces an anisotropic lattice distortion and can thereby change the symmetry of lattice. This will modify the stability of stripes drastically and hence superconductivity.

A uniaxial pressure cell, which can be used in a commercial SQUID magnetome- ter (MPMS, Quantum Design), was developed. In order to reduce the background signal from the pressure cell, the main body is made of a high-strength plastic mate- rial. The background signal was found to be negligibly small, as compared with the Meissner signal of a few mg of the sample. The sample was pressurized uniaxi- ally in the cell until it breaks up. On applying pressure, we sometimes observed a reduction of the magnitude of the superconducting signal. We believe that this is due to micro-cracks, which likely reduce the uniaxial nature and cause a broadening of the transition. In the follow- ing, therefore, we deal only with data, which did not show any appreciable reduction of the shielding signal.","0"

The data clearly demonstrate that the anisotropy of the uniaxial pressure effect exists not only between the in-plane and the out-of-plane directions but also within the tetragonal CuO 2 planes. As seen in , the superconduct- ing transition shifts to a lower temperature with increas- ing pressure applied along [001]. In remarkable contrast, T c increases when the pressure is applied parallel to the CuO 2 planes (both the [100] and the [110] directions), as shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c). This contrast between the in-plane pressure and the out-of-plane pressure has been known for many years. A substantial change of T c , associated with anisotropic pressure induced by epitaxial strain, was observed in underdoped La 2−x Sr(Ba) x CuO 4 thin films . In the case of films on LaSrAlO 4 sub- strate, a substantial increase of T c up to 50 K was ob- served. The LaSrAlO 4 substrate has a slightly smaller in- plane lattice constant than those of bulk La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 , which results in the in-plane compression and the out-of- plane expansion of the La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 film. The rapid in- crease of T c has been ascribed to such an epitaxial strain effect. Consistent with this, a substantial decrease of T c was observed for SrTiO 3 substrate with a large lattice","1"

This strong dependence of T c on anisotropic pressure was also directly demon- strated by a recent uniaxial pressure measurement . Our observation of distinct differences between the in- plane and the out-of-plane pressure effects agrees well with these observations. The most remarkable result here is the substantial dif- ference between the [100] direction and the [110] direc- tion, both within the CuO 2 plane. This is the first obser- vation of an in-plane anisotropic pressure effect in high-T c cuprates.  Only when the pressure is applied along [110] do we see a strikingly large increase of T c with in- creasing pressure. Indeed, the application of only several kbar causes T c to almost double. In contrast, when the pressure is applied along [100], only a small change in T c is observed. This implies that the in-plane pressure effect cannot be simply described by a superposition of pressure effects along two orthogonal directions but strongly de- pends on the symmetry of strains induced. This novel anisotropic pressure effect is visually summarized in Fig- ure. Note that the increase of T c with P/[110] upon pressure, dT c /dP [110] ∼ 2.5 K/kbar is even larger than observed on La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 around x ∼ 1/8 with hy- drostatic pressure , previously the largest pressure effect ever observed in high-T c cuprates.","0"
"3917","JPS0731123-CC","11","We ascribe this striking in-plane anisotropy to the in- timate coupling between the one-dimensional stripes and an anisotropic lattice distortion within the CuO 2 planes. The stripes are running along either [100] or [010], switch- ing alternately from plane to plane along the c-axis . Note that the [110] direction is rotated 45 degrees to the stripe directions. Since the symmetry of strain in- duced by the [110] pressure does not match with those of the one-dimensional stripes, it appears natural that the [110] pressure suppresses stripe formation and there- fore enhances superconductivity. The [100] pressure, on the other hand, is parallel or perpendicular to the stripes, which gives rise to an orthorhombic strain matching with the local symmetry of stripes within each CuO 2 plane. The [100] strain therefore might not be so detrimental to stripe formation. In addition, the 90 degree rotation of the stripe direction from plane to plane may act to cancel out the [100] strain effects.","0"

The tilting angle decreases upon Sr doping and, eventually at the critical angle, drives the stripe magnet into SC. The strain, at 45 degrees to the stripe direction [100] or [010], very likely reduces the LTT tilting angle because of the symmetry mismatch. This decrease of the tilt- ing angle will shift the phase boundary between stripes formation and superconductivity to lower x and will sub- stantially enhance T c of the sample in the critical region. From these considerations, we believe that the extremely large uniaxial and anisotropic pressure effect within the CuO 2 planes in La 1.64 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.16 CuO 4 is realized by an intimate interplay of the strain-stripe coupling mediated by the lattice distortion and the stripe criticality.","0"

First, by checking for this anisotropy, we may identify the contribution from the stripes and particularly dynamical stripes to supercon- ductivity itself. Indeed, uniaxial pressure measurements are now under progress on samples with Sr content x away from the critical composition x = 0.16, in order to explore the influence of dynamical stripes. Second, using [110] pressure, we should be able to switch the stripe magnet to a superconductor using relatively low pressures of a few kbars, if the sample is located at the stripe side of the critical region. We indeed observed such a stripe magnet to superconductor transition at 1 kbar in a nonsupercon- ducting La 1.65 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.15 CuO 4, which has a marginally smaller Sr content than the samples shown in Figures. This magnitude of pressure can be generated quite easily without any special facility. Besides, in contrast with the hydrostatic pressure, the sample in the uniaxial experiments is covered by the piston cylinder only from the top and bottom and beam probes can reach the sam- ple quite easily. It could be possible therefore to carry out a variety of physical measurements, including angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), neutron diffraction etc., to trace the evolution from stripe magnet to superconductor continuously using the same piece of crystal.","0"

Many experiments have provided evidence (NMR , angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) , specific heat , electron-tunneling spectroscopy and STM ) for a gap-like structure in electronic excitation spectra. There is a consensus on that the pseudogap is a characteristic feature of the underdoped regime of copper-oxides, and the value of T* increases with the decrease of hole concentration. For example, in tunneling measurements on underdoped Bi2212 single crystals by STM, the pseudogap was detected even at room temperature . At the same time, tunneling measurements showed that the pseudogap is also present in slightly overdoped samples as well . An advantage of tunneling spectroscopy is that it is particularly sensitive to the density of state (DOS) near the Fermi level E F and, thus, is capable of detecting any gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum at E F . In addition to this, tunneling spectroscopy has a high energy resolution .","0"
"3927","EPL0490086-CC","4","In general, the pseudogap in cuprates can originate from the charge-density- wave (CDW) order, the spin-density-wave (SDW) order due to local antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations, the presence of incoherent Cooper pairs, or from their combination (so-called Ansatz) . From earlier studies, the pseudogap was associated with a SDW gap due to local AF correlations . Very recent measurements of high-frequency conductivity that track the phase- correlation time in the normal state of underdoped Bi2212 showed that the incoherent Cooper pairs remain up to T pair which is well above T c , however, lower than T* . Thus, between T c and T pair , there is a contribution of incoherent Cooper pairs to the pseudogap. Indeed, there is a consensus on that, to the contrary to conventional SCs, the formation of the Copper pairs and the establishment of the phase coherence among them in cuprates occur at different temperatures, T pair > T c . So, it is reasonable to expect that the incoherent Cooper pairs have to be observed above T c in different types of measurements including tunneling. The T pair scales with T*, thus, the difference between T pair and T c is the highest in the underdoped regime and becomes smaller in the overdoped regime .","0"

The sample resistance (with the contacts), R sample , at room temperature varied from 5 Ω to about 1 kΩ, depending on the sample. The I(V) and dI/dV(V) tunneling characteristics were determined by the four-terminal method using a standard lock-in modulation technique.

In the absence of generally accepted model for the pseudogap, we consider the presence of the gap-like features in tunneling spectra as a sign of the pseudogap (for more details, see Ref. ). There is no sign indicating at what temperature the superconducting gap was closed. Across T c , the superconducting tunneling spectra evolve continuously into a normal- state quasiparticle-gap structure which vanishes at 232 K < T * < 290 K but remains almost unchanged with temperature up to 232 K . Such evolution of superconducting spectra into normal-state spectra across T c has been also observed in superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) junctions .

It is difficult to indicate exactly the origins of these humps, especially, the wide ones which are traceable to high temperatures. However, we will try just to determine characteristic temperatures from temperature dependencies of these humps, which are shown in . We use straight (dash) line in in order to estimate the value of T 0 which is of the order of 110 -115 K. The origin of this hump we discuss further. We concentrate now on the behavior of the curve with dots in , which correspond to the temperature dependence of wide humps. The fall of this curve with the increase of temperature between T c and T 0 supports an idea that there are some changes in the system. The indication of some changes which begin at ~ 210 K with the increase of temperature can be explained by the disappearance of local AF correlations . It seems that, between T 0 and 210 K, there is no principal changes in the system. From Figs. 1, 2 and 3, the value of T * is of the order of 280 K.

"3932","EPL0490086-CC","9","We discuss now the origin of the contribution to the pseudogap, which disappears at T 0 with the increase of temperature. This contribution can be explained by the disappearance of the CDW or/and SDW order(s), or incoherent Cooper pairs. From the common sense, the CDW or SDW order is likely to be appear above T c and not to disappear. Consequently, it is most likely that this contribution to the pseudogap is made by preformed pairs . Tunneling spectroscopy is sensitive exclusively to the magnitude of the order parameter. Thus, if the humps originate from the presence of preformed pairs, then the magnitude of the gap-like structure reflects the average value of binding energy per particle . However, our results alone cannot prove that this contribution originates from preformed pairs. We can argue that high-frequency conductivity measurements showed that the incoherent Copper pairs remain well above T c in Bi2212, and it was predicted by the theory . It is also in agreement with a MCS (Magnetic Coupling between Stripes) model proposed very recently . There is also an alternative explanation for the presence of this contribution to the pseudogap, it is possible that this contribution originates from the presence of the Bi2223 phase with T c = 110 K.

Thus, the value of T* ≈ 280 K found in our measurements for slightly overdoped single crystals is in an excellent agreement with the SIN tunneling measurements . In slightly overdoped Bi2212, the pseudogap has been also observed in SIS tunneling measurements performed by break- junction technique . The value of T* is found to be of the order of 190 K. However, the analysis of SIS spectra presented in Ref. 24 (see ) shows that, in fact, the T* value is of the order of 290 -300 K. In the literature, there is a clear discrepancy in the definition of T*. For slightly overdoped Bi2212, the temperature 270 -300 K corresponds most likely to the charge ordering, T* charge ≈ 270 -300 K .

"3938","JPS0732912-CC","2","Superconductivity in transition metal oxides (TMOs) has been one of exciting fields in solid state physics due to its unconventional properties. Many superconductors in TMOs crystallize in perovskite related structures. Recently, an exceptional TMO superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 was found with T c = 1.0 K, which crystallizes in the pyrochlore structure. 1) The pyrochlore structure contains a corner-sharing tetrahedral network made of transition metal cations called the pyrochlore lattice, and is known as one of spin frustration systems in the case that the transition metal cation has a localized moment with antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbors. Very recently, three related compounds AOs 2 O 6 (A = K, Rb, Cs) named the β-pyrochlore oxides were found, 2-4) which contain the pyrochlore lattice made of Os atoms. They show superconductivity at T c = 9.6 K, 6.3 K and 3.3 K, respectively. Particularly in KOs 2 O 6 the T c is almost one order higher than in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . The mechanism of the superconductivity has been extensively studied and was suggested to be unconventional. For example, a remarkably large upper critical field H c2 of 38 T exceeding Pauli's limit was reported for KOs 2 O 6 . 5) Moreover, the µSR and NMR experiments suggested an anisotropic order parameter. On the other hand, there are a few reports which suggest conventional BCS superconductivity for RbOs 2 O 6 . It is plausible to assume that the systematic change of T c in AOs 2 O 6 is due to the size effect of alkaline metal ions. The lattice constant is almost proportional to the ionic radius of A ions, and the T c increases with decreasing the lattice constant from Cs to K under a positive chemical pressure. 4) This is in contrast to the case of conventional BCS superconductivity in a single-band model, where the T c decreases under a positive pressure, because the density of state (DOS) decreases with decreasing the lattice volume, as typically observed in alkali metal doped C 60 superconductors A 3 C 60 . This contrast may indicate the uniqueness of the superconductivity in AOs 2 O 6 . Thus, it is interesting to examine physical pressure effects on T c . In this note, we report diamagnetic measurements under pressures up to 1.2 GPa using a piston-cylinder type pressure cell on the three compounds of AOs 2 O 6 . In the α-pyrochlore oxide superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 the high pressure study revealed that T c increases from 1.0 K to 3.0 K at 2 GPa and then decreases to vanish above 3 GPa. In the case of RbOs 2 O 6 , Khasanov et al. reported a high pressure experiment in which the T c increases monotonously up to 1.0 GPa with the initial slope of 0.90 K/GPa. Polycrystalline samples were prepared as reported previously. 2-4) They were nearly single-phase, but with a small amount of OsO 2 or Os metal. Magnetic susceptibility was measured in a Quantum Design MPMS. Quasi-hydrostatic pressures up to 1.2 GPa were produced by a piston-cylinder type pressure cell which is made of hardened CuBe alloy. Daphne oil 7373 was used as a pressure transmitting medium. The actual pressure was determined in each experiment by measuring the superconducting transition temperature of Pb or Sn which was put into the pressure medium together with a sample and placed about 2 cm away from the sample.","1"

In order to compare the three systems, the pressure dependence of T c (P) normalized by the T c at ambient pressure (AP) is shown in .

This means that the lattice volume is the key parameter to determine the T c of AOs 2 O 6 .

Two samples from the same NaxCoO2 were examined, SC bilayer-hydrate sample with Tc ∼ 4.7 K and non-SC monolayer-hydrate sample. From the measurement of nuclear-spin lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 in the SC sample, it was found that the coherence peak is absent just below Tc and that 1/T1 is proportional to temperature far below Tc. These results, which are in qualitatively agreement with the previous result by Fujimoto et al., suggest strongly that unconventional superconductivity is realized in this compound. In the normal state, 1/T1T of the SC sample shows gradual increase below 100K down to Tc, whereas 1/T1T of the non-SC sample shows the Korringa behavior in this temperature range. From the comparison between 1/T1T and χ bulk in the SC sample, the increase of 1/T1T is attributed to nearly ferromagnetic fluctuations. These remarkable findings suggest that the SC sample possesses nearly ferromagnetic fluctuations, which are possibly related with the unconventional superconductivity in this compound. The implication of this finding is discussed.","1"

From the comparison between 1/T 1 T and χ bulk or Knight shift, we can have an important information about spin- fluctuation character, since the latter are related with the static susceptibility at q = 0, χ(0). If AFM corre- lations are dominant, which is the case in cuprate su- perconductors, dynamical susceptibility has peaks at the AFM wave vector Q apart from q = 0, therefore 1/T 1 T is mainly determined by staggered susceptibility, χ(Q). In most cuprate superconductors, 1/T 1 T and χ bulk show different behavior, i.e., 1/T 1 T is enhanced whereas χ bulk decreases with deceasing temperature due to the develop- ment of AFM correlations. 13) Such information played a crucial role in identifying the existence of AFM spin fluc- tuations in underdoped cuprate superconductor. On the contrary, when FM correlations are dominant, the dy- namical susceptibility shows a peak at q = 0, thus 1/T 1 T is dominant by χ(0) component.

The nearly FM state is also suggested by the large Wilson ratio (3.33), where the values of χ bulk and γ of specific-heat measurement just above T c 18) are adopted for the estimation. Until now, it was found that most unconventional su- perconductors appearing in the paramagnetic state have strong AFM spin fluctuations. Even in spin-triplet super- conductors reported so far, i.e., UPt and Sr 2 RuO 4 , dominant spin fluctuations are not FM but AFM like. Re- cently unconventional superconductivity was discovered far below FM transition, which is considered as spin- triplet superconductors in the FM state. However, although the existence of FM fluctuations above T c has not been identified in the FM superconductors due to dif- ficulty of experiments, it is likely that FM fluctuations are mostly quenched deep into the FM ordered phase. There has been no report about superconductivity ap- pearing in the predominance of FM fluctuations. Thus, as far as we know, Na x CoO 2 ·yH 2 O reported here is the first example that the superconductivity appears in the nearly FM metallic state. In such a situation, spin-triplet super- conductivity in analogy with superfluidity of 3 He would be the most promising state within possible SC pairing states.

Quite recently, Waki et al. reported that the Co-NMR spec- trum in the aligned SC sample is unchanged on passing through T c, 2) whereas Kobayashi et al. reported the de- crease of the Knight shift in the non-aligned SC sam- ple.

The first oxygen-isotope effect (OIE) studies on the transition temperature T c were performed on optimally doped samples, showing no significant isotope shift . However, later experiments revealed a small but finite dependence of T c on the oxygen-isotope mass M O , as well as on the copper-isotope mass M Cu . Moreover, a general trend in the dependence of the OIE exponent α O = −d ln T c/d ln M O on the doping level was found which appears to be generic for all cuprate supercon- ductors : In the underdoped region α O is large, even exceeding the conventional BCS-value α = 0.5 and becomes small in the optimally doped and overdoped regime.","0"
"3968","JPC0150L17-CC","3","There is increasing evidence that a strong electron- phonon coupling is present in cuprate superconductors, which may lead to the formation of polarons (bare charge carriers accompanied by local lattice distortions) . One way to test this hypothesis is to demonstrate that the effective mass of the supercarriers m * depends on the mass M of the lattice atoms. This is in contrast to conventional BCS superconductors, where only the 'bare' charge carriers condense into Cooper pairs, and m * is es- sentially independent of M . For cuprate superconductors (clean limit) the in-plane penetration depth λ ab is simply given by λ −2 ab (0) ∝ n s /m * ab , where n s is the superconduct- ing charge carrier density, and m * ab is the in-plane effec- tive mass of the superconducting charge carriers. This implies that the OIE on λ ab is due to a shift in n s and/or m * ab : Therefore a possible mass dependence of m * ab can be tested by investigating the isotope effect on λ ab , provided that the contribution of n s to the total isotope shift is known.","0"

The 18 O content in the samples, as deter- mined from a change of the sample weight after the iso- tope exchange, was found to be 78(2)% for both sam- ples.

(ii) According to a model that describes the suppression of T c in Y 1−x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ , the num- ber of supercarriers decreases linearly with increasing x in the range of 0.05 < x < 0.5, and consequently ∆n s /n s = −∆x/x. Moreover, for 0.1 < x < 0.5 the transition temperature T c decreases linearly with x, with ∆T c /∆x ≃ −150 K/Pr atom . Combining this two relations one obtains: ∆T c ≃ −150 · x · ∆n s /n s . As- suming that the observed OIE on λ −2 ab is only due to a change of n s (∆m * ab /m * ab ≃ 0), one can estimate the cor- responding shift of T c . For x = 0.3 and x = 0.4 one finds ∆T c ≃ −1.8(4) K and −4.2(6) K, respectively. The ex- perimental values, however, are much lower (see ): ∆T c = −1.3(1) K (x = 0.3) and ∆T c = −1.7(1) K (x = 0.4). We thus conclude that any change in n s dur- ing the exchange procedure must be small, and that the change of λ ab is mainly due to the OIE on the in-plane effective mass m * ab with ∆m * ab /m * ab ≃ 5(2) % and 9(2) % for x = 0.3 and x = 0.4, respectively. This implies that the effective supercarrier mass m * ab in this cuprate su- perconductor depends on the oxygen mass of the lattice atoms, which is not expected for a conventional phonon- mediated BSC superconductor.","0"

For comparison we also included the recent magnetic torque results of un- derdoped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 . It is evident that these exponents are linearly correlated: A best fit yields A = 1.8(4) and B = −0.01, so that β O ≃ A · α O . This empirical relation appears to be generic for cuprate superconductors. Quantitatively one can understand this behavior in terms of an empiri- cal relation between T c and the µSR depolarization rate σ sc (0) . It was shown that for most fami- lies of cuprate superconductors the simple parabolic re- lation T c = 2σ(1 − σ/2) describes the experimental data rather well (here T c = T c/T m c , σ = σ sc (0)/σ m sc (0), and T m c and σ m sc (0) are the transition temperature and de- polarization rate of the optimally doped system). Using this parabolic Ansatz, one readily obtains the linear re- lation between β O and α O : In the heavily underdoped regime","0"

The dashed line represents a best fit to the empirical relation βO = A · αO + B. (T c → 0) β O /α O → 1. For the underdoped samples shown in the reduced critical temperature T c is in the range 0.5 to 0.7, yielding β O /α O = 1.2 − 1.4, in agreement with A = 1.8(4) obtained from the experi- mental data. Very recently, it was pointed out that the unusual doping dependence of the OIE on T c and on λ −2 ab (0) naturally follows from the doping driven 3D-2D crossover and the 2D quantum superconductor to insu- lator transition in the underdoped limit. It is predicted that in the underdoped regime β O /α O → 1, which is consistent with the parabolic Ansatz.","0"
"3979","JPC0150L17-CC","14","In summary, we performed µSR measurements of the in-plane penetration depth λ ab in underdoped Y 1−x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (x = 0.3, 0.4) for samples with two different oxygen isotopes ( 16 O and 18 O). A pronounced OIE on both the transition temperature T c and λ −2 ab (0) was observed, which increases with decreasing T c . The isotope shift on λ −2 ab (0) is attributed to a shift in the in- plane effective mass m * ab . For x = 0.3 and 0.4 we find ∆m * ab /m * ab = −5(2)% and -9(2)%, respectively. Further- more, an empirical relation between the OIE exponents β O and α O was found that appears to be generic for vari- ous classes of cuprate superconductors. The OIE on m * ab implies that the superconducting carriers have polaronic character, and that lattice effects play an essential role in the occurrence of high-temperature superconductivity.","0"
