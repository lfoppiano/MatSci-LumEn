1,SST01600L7-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,1,"A series of high-quality La2−xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) superconductor crystals in the under-doping region with x = 0.063, 0.07, 0.09, 0.10, 0.111 and 0.125 has been successfully prepared by traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) technique. The crystals are large and free of sub-grains and foreign phases. The high crystal quality has been revealed by double-crystal x-ray rocking curves and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry combined with ion- beam channeling effect. We find that the evolutions of the superconducting transition width and volume fraction as a function of carrier concentration exhibit interesting anomalies in the vicinity of some ""magic number"" doping levels such as x = 1/4 2 (=0.0625) and 1/3 2 (=0.111). We argue that these behaviours are of intrinsic electronic origin."
2,SST01600L7-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) system is known to be one of the cuprate superconductor systems with fewer components and a simple layered structure of K 2 NiF 4 type which can be basically described as a stacking of single-plane CuO 2 superconduct- ing layers separated by two (La, Sr)O layers. The intrinsic Josephson junctions of LSCO have re- cently been characterized as stacked serial SIS junctions , and its high Josephson plasma fre- quency in THz region is quite interesting for de- veloping new electronic devices such as THz gen- erators and detectors . On the other hand, its electronic states strongly depend on hole-doping which can be achieved with the substitution of Sr 2+ cations for La 3+ ones. At very low doping (x < 0.02), La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 is an antiferromag- netic Mott insulator. After crossing a spin glass state (0.02 < x < 0.05) , it becomes a super- conductor (0.05 < x < 0.26) and then changes to a normal metal (0.26 < x < 0.6) and fi- nally it behaves as a semiconductor (x > 0.6) . In the superconductor regime, the critical temperature of LSCO reaches its maximum of 38 K at x = 0.15. The investigation on the doping dependences of low temperature physical proper- ties in both normal and superconducting states is important for acquiring a better understanding of high T C superconductivity and strongly cor- related electron systems. LSCO system is there- fore not only attractive in its possible applications but also in such fundamental research. For both purposes, high-quality and sizable single crystals are highly demanded, and persistent effort has been made in the crystal growth using differ- ent techniques . Traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) method is widely accepted as a unique approach to growing such incongru- ent melting oxide superconductor crystals. This crucible-free technique avoids the crystal contam- ination from crucible material that will otherwise interfere with the observation of intrinsic phys- ical properties. The large temperature gradient produced by focused lamp images makes possible good solid-liquid interfaces and a stable molten zone."

We first report here the re- sults of TSFZ growth and characterizations of some properties of these LSCO crystals. Inter- esting anomalous doping dependences of super- conducting properties are observed in this series of crystals and are briefly discussed."
4,SST01600L7-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,4,"High purity (≥ 99.99%) oxides La 2 O 3 , CuO and carbonate SrCO 3 were used as the raw ma- terials. For the feed rods, the initial composition was (1-x/2)La 2 O 3 /xSrCO 3 /CuO in molar ratio with x = 0.063, 0.07, 0.09, 0.10, 0.111 and 0.125. Excess CuO of 1 -2 mol% was added for com- pensating its evaporation loss in the growth pro- cess. The solvents were much richer in CuO as self-flux, typically of 78 mol% CuO. In determin- ing the Sr contents of the solvents, we took into account the previously reported results of distri- bution coefficients k Sr of Sr doping into La 2 CuO 4 . The Preparation of dense and homogeneous feed rods is one of the key factors in achieving a stable and continuous TSFZ growth. Each step in the preparation was carefully checked and op- timized, such as thorough mixing and grinding of the starting and prefired powders by a planetary ball mill, forming compact cylindrical rods under a high hydrostatic pressure before the feed rods being finally well sintered. An infrared heating floating-zone furnace with a quartet ellipsoidal mirror (Crystal Systems Inc., Model FZ-T-10000-H) was used for TSFZ experiments. The crystals were grown under an oxygen pressure of 0.2 MPa at a zone traveling rate of 0.8 mm/hr using seed crystals orientated along orthorhombic or tetrag- onal [100] or [110] directions."
5,SST01600L7-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,5,"By careful operations and the use of high qual- ity feed rods, a stable molten zone was success- fully maintained in most experiments until pro- ceeding growths were artificially stopped just be- fore the whole feed rods, typically 125 mm long, ran out. Shown in is the photo for one of as-grown ingots, with a typical size of 5-6 mm in diameter and 110 mm in length. Polished crystal pieces cut from the ingots were checked by optical microscopy using polarized or normal light. No grain boundaries were observed in the crystallized ingots after several centimeters away from the starting point of crystallization on seed crystals, indicating that large single-grain crys- tals were obtained. The compositions of grown crystals estimated by ICP-AES were very close to those of feed rods, and no foreign phases in crystal samples were detected by powder XRD analysis."

The full- width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), which is cor- related with the crystal mosaicity, is as small as 0.10 o . This is one of the best data reported so far for LSCO crystals . The quality of the same crystal was also examined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry combined with ion- beam channeling effect (RBS-channeling) which was carried out using 2 MeV well collimated He ion beam and a Si detector set at 160 o to the in- cident direction. The channeling spectrum was taken along the c-axis of the crystal. The RBS- channeling minimum yield is only χ min = 3.8% , being another evidence for the high quality of the crystal. Moreover, it can be seen from that, for the aligned spectrum, the backscattering counts increase very slowly with depth. This is a strong indication that the defect density in the crystal is very low."
7,SST01600L7-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,7,"The Meissner (field-cooled) and shielding (zero- field-cooled) signals of all the six crystal sam- ples were measured on a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS XL) in a low field of 5 Oe with c/H, as shown in . The super- conducting critical temperatures observed from the Meissner effects range from about 11K for x = 0.063 to about 31K for x = 0.125. It is of much interest to note that, around some spe- cial doping levels with ""magic numbers"" such as x = 1/4 2 (=0.0625) and 1/3 2 (=0.111), the su- perconducting transitions are much sharper (∆T ≈ 2K) than those at the doping contents away from them and the Meissner fraction drops re- markably upon doping in the close vicinity of x = 1/3 2 . Moreover, the shielding sig- nals exhibit the same broadening trend for the doping levels away from the magic numbers and they all have 100% volume fraction. This indi- cates that there is no macroscopic inhomogene- ity and/or weak links. Generally speaking, crys- talline imperfection may broaden superconduct- ing transition and a narrow transition width is"
8,SST01600L7-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,8,"expected for superconductor crystals of high qual- ity. We have evidenced that the x = 0.09 LSCO crystal is of excellent crystalline perfection, but, contrary to the expectation, it exhibits a broad superconducting transition. As a further check, the La 1.91 Sr 0.09 CuO 4 sample was annealed under various conditions for several to twelve days at 600-1000 o C under oxygen flow or 0.3 MPa oxy- gen pressure before quenched in liquid nitrogen. However, magnetic measurements showed that its transition width remained unchanged after these annealing processes. These results and observa- tions thus lead us to conclude that such anoma- lies of superconducting properties in the vicin- ity of these magic doping levels as well as the broad transitions at the dopant contents away from these magic numbers are of intrinsic elec- tronic origin. At these special carrier concentra- tions, some specific electronic state may occur but it may not be completely pinned down elsewhere in this doping region. Indeed, both supercon- ducting electronic phase separations and the formation of 2D electronic lattices at magic doping numbers are reported in Sr doped and Sr/O co-doped lanthanum cuprates. Further related investigations are currently in progress."

The crystals are pure, subgrain-free and large in size. We have observed from the magnetic measure- ments that the superconducting transition width narrows in the close vicinity of some magic dop- ing levels while remains broad at other dopant contents, and the Meissner fraction shows an un- usual decrease around x = 1/3 2 . We suppose that such interesting anomalous behaviours in su- perconducting state may probably originate from some intrinsic electronic state occurring at these special carrier-dopings."

15,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,1,"New results from tunneling spectroscopies on near optimally-doped single crystals of Tl2Ba2CuO6 (Tl-2201) junctions are presented. The superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) tunnel junc- tions are obtained using the point-contact technique with a Au tip. The tunneling conductances reproducibly show a sharp cusp-like subgap, prominent quasiparticle peaks with a consistent asym- metry, and weakly decreasing backgrounds. A rigorous analysis of the SIN tunneling data is per- formed using two different models for the d x 2 −y 2 (d-wave) density of states (DOS). Based on these and earlier results, the tunneling DOS of Tl-2201 have exhibited the most reproducible data that are consistent with a d-wave gap symmetry. We show that the dip feature at 2∆ that is clearly seen in SIN tunneling data of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O 8+δ is also present in Tl-2201, but at a weaker level. The gap values for crystals with a bulk Tc = 86 K are in the range of 19-25 meV."

17,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,3,"Tunneling spectroscopy has revealed the complex characteristics of high-T c superconductors (HTS's). Tunneling spectra on Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ (Bi-2212) , Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO x and HgBa 2 CuO 4 (Hg-1201) , have shown both symmetric and asymmetric tunneling conductance peaks, and variable subgap features that range from sharp cusp- like to flat, BCS-like. Additionally, tunneling experiments on YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO) and Bi-2212 in certain crystal orientations have also shown the presence of zero-bias peaks in the conductance data. In Bi-2212 there exists a prominent dip feature (at eV∼ 2∆) that is asymmetric with bias voltage, being much stronger for a polarity that corresponds to removal of quasiparticles from the superconductor. These unusual observations have made it difficult to properly analyze the results of tunneling experiments and have complicated the deduction of important properties of HTS's such as the pairing symmetry."
18,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,4,"There is an emerging consensus that the predominant pairing symmetry in hole-doped HTS cuprates is d x 2 −y 2 (d-wave). Evidence from tricrystal ring experiments points to pure d-wave for YBCO. Grain boundary and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) junctions indicate a small s-wave contribution to the d-wave symmetry on YBCO which was attributed to the orthorhombicity of YBCO. Tunneling and penetration depth measurements of electron-doped Nd 2−x Ce x CuO 4 are compatible with s-wave symmetry. Another well-studied, hole doped, HTS is Bi-2212 because of the availability of high quality single crystals, and the ability to easily cleave this crystal along the a-b plane. Results from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) indicate an anisotropic gap with a minimum in the (π,π) direction that is consistent with d-wave symmetry . Furthermore, results from ARPES and STM have exhibited spectral features that are also observed in PCT, such as quasiparticle peak, dip and hump. They have also shown the puzzling feature of an increasing energy gap size with decreasing doping concentration in Bi-2212. DeWilde et al. have shown that the study on Bi-2212 using three different techniques (PCT, break-junction, and STM) can produce very similar results as far as gap size, dip structure, and subgap shape are concerned, even when the resistance of the STM junction was of the order of GΩ while it was the order of 1kΩ-100kΩ for PCT and break junction. However, point contact tunneling (PCT) results also occasionally show a flat subgap structure which is not easily reconciled with d-wave symmetry."
19,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,5,"Quasiparticle tunneling has failed to definitely reveal the pairing symmetry in Hg-1201. PCT on polycrystal samples of this HTS seems to show a density of states (DOS) that is flat near zero-bias, consistent with s-wave symmetry , whereas Wei et al. claim that STM measurements on the same HTS seems to be consistent with a d-wave gap symmetry. While it has been shown that tunneling directionality effects can produce a flat subgap conductance with a d-wave gap, there is no obvious physical mechanism for preferred tunneling directions. It is therefore more likely that the sporadic observations of flat subgap conductances in HTS simply adds fuel to the debate over pairing symmetry."
20,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,6,"Experimental evidence of d-wave pairing symmetry on Tl-2201 is more convincing. Results from tricrystal ring experiments indicate a pure d-wave pairing , although admixture of d and s-wave pairing is also interpreted from in-plane torque anisotropy experiments. We have earlier reported the tunneling studies of optimally- doped Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6 crystals (Tl-2201) with T c = 91 K which clearly and reproducibly showed a tunneling DOS that is consistent with a momentum-averaged d-wave gap symmetry. In that report (Ref. ), our analysis of the superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) tunneling conductance was somewhat primitive, utilizing a simple model for the d-wave DOS. In this report, we present additional tunneling data on Tl-2201 crystals with T c = 86 K that have been synthesized using a different technique than the one described in Ref. . The location of the quasiparticle peaks in the SIN conductance data are consistent with the ones in our earlier report and all of the data again display the cusp feature at zero bias. However, here we present a more exhaustive treatment of many junctions, with a wide range of junction conductance (∼0.1 mS-2 mS). We have also performed a more rigorous analysis of the SIN conductance data using two different models for the tunneling DOS with a d-wave gap. We again find good agreement with d-wave symmetry. Some of the SIN data display a weak dip feature at eV∼ 2∆. We have generated superconductor-insulator- superconductor (SIS) conductance curves using the SIN data. The resulting SIS curves display the characteristic dip features at nearly 3∆ that are consistent with those observed in the SIS tunneling conductance of Bi-2212. This is the first study to clearly indicate that the dip feature is present in the SIN conductance data of Tl-2201, but with a smaller magnitude than observed in Bi-2212. Further comparison with tunneling data of Bi-2212 reveals that while the bulk T c of Bi-2212 and Tl-2201 are approximately the same, the magnitude of the typical energy gap of Tl-2201 is smaller. The origin of this discrepancy is still unknown at present, but some insight has been gained with this study. We note first that the largest gaps found for the Tl-2201 (∆=25 meV) are close to those of Bi-2212 when both have the same T c =86 K. Furthermore, due to the strong dependence of the gap magnitude on doping concentration in Bi-2212, we suggest that the smaller gap values in Tl-2201 may be due to a surface that is slightly overdoped."
21,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,7,"Tl-2201 has a tetragonal crystal structure with a single Cu − O layer per unit cell which is relatively simple when compared to the bilayer and trilayer high-T c superconductors. However, Tl 2 Ba 2 Ca 2−n Cu 2 O 2n+3 (n=1, 2, and 3) family is very sensitive to thallium and oxygen content which influences the structure and superconducting properties. The optimally-doped compound of Tl-2201 has a T c of approximately 91 K and this value can be reduced to zero on the overdoped side by oxygen annealing. The Tl-2201 single crystals were grown from a flux in an alumina crucible with an alumina lid, sealed to avoid loss of thallium oxide. Tl 2 O 3 , BaO 2 and CuO powders were mixed at the atomic ratio of Tl:Ba:Cu=2.2:2:2 using excess Tl 2 O 3 and CuO as the flux. The crucibles, containing about 50 g of charge, were loaded in a vertical tube furnace and heated rapidly to 925-950 o C. This temperature was held for 1/2 hour. The furnace was then cooled at 5 o C/h to 875 o C, and finally cooled to room temperature. The crystals were platelet-shaped, with a basal plane area of about 1 mm 2 and a thickness along the c-axis varying between 20-100µm. The critical temperature of the samples is determined by ac magnetization measurements."
22,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,8,"The experimental setup of our PCT system is designed for data collection over a large range of sample temperature. In addition to this feature, tunneling measurements can also be performed in high magnetic fields, up to 6 T. The details of the measurement system can be found elsewhere. Cleaved single crystal samples of Tl-2201 usually have shiny surfaces in the a-b plane. Each is mounted on a substrate using an epoxy so that the tip approaches nominally along the c-axis. The electrical leads are connected to two sides of the sample by using silver paint. Non-superconducting Au is used as a counter-electrode. It is mechanically and chemically cleaned before each run."
23,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,9,"While the differential micrometer driven tip approaches the sample, the I(V ) signal is continuously monitored on an oscilloscope until an acceptable tunnel junction is obtained, i.e. one which displays an obvious superconducting gap feature. All tunnel junctions are initially formed at 4.2 K to prevent any sample surface deterioration. First derivative measurements, σ = dI/dV , were obtained using a Kelvin bridge circuit with the usual lock-in procedure. I(V ) and dI/dV are simultaneously plotted on a chart and digitally recorded on a computer. DeWilde et al. have shown that tunneling results on Bi-2212 using PCT can produce results that are consistent with those obtained using STM."
24,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,10,"In contrast to other surface sensitive experimental methods such as STM, ARPES, Raman, and auger techniques, the advantage of the point contact method for cuprates is that the tip can be used to scrape, clean, and in some cases cleave the surface. The tip often can penetrate through the surface and reach the bulk of the crystal. The cleaving of the surface sometimes results in the formation of SIS junctions, as in the case of Bi-2212. This happens when a piece of the HTS crystal attaches itself to the tip, forming an ohmic contact. As the tip is retracted, the piece forms an SIS break junction with the bulk crystal . Unlike Bi-2212, Tl-2201 has stronger bonds between planes and consequently SIS junctions could not be formed this way."
25,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,11,"Figure shows the conductances of eight junctions on three different Tl-2201 crystals, each with a bulk T c near 86 K. These junctions are representative of a larger set of data and they demonstrate several characteristics that are typical for PCT tunneling in Tl-2201. Each junction exhibits a single energy gap feature with conductance peaks at |V | = 20 − 25 mV. The voltage is that of the sample respect to the tip and thus negative bias corresponds to removal of electrons from the superconductor. There is a characteristic asymmetry in the conductance peaks such that the negative bias peak is higher than the one at positive bias. This type of asymmetry has also been seen in PCT and STM studies of Bi-2212, most consistently in overdoped samples. It has been pointed out that this conductance peak asymmetry may be a signature of the d-wave pairing. The background conductances for |eV | > ∆ are generally weakly decreasing with bias similar to that in Bi-2212, and it is these type of junctions that exhibit the largest peak height to background (PHB) ratio. A few junctions show a flat or slightly increasing background with a smaller PHB ratio. This implies that the decreasing background is an intrinsic property of the quasiparticle DOS. While such a feature may be due to the underlying band structure DOS, we note the absence of any van Hove singularity (VHS) in these data as well as earlier PCT data on Tl-2201. All of the junctions exhibit a cusp-like feature at zero bias which is characteristic of a d-wave DOS."
26,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,12,"The tunneling data are analyzed with two different methods. For Model I, the superconducting data are first normalized by constructing a ""normal state"" conductance obtained by fitting the high bias data to a third order polynomial. The normalized conductance data are compared to a weighted momentum averaged d-wave DOS, Here Γ is a lifetime broadening factor, f (θ), is an angular weighting function, and ∆(θ) = ∆ o cos(2θ) represents the d-wave gap symmetry expected from a mean-field BCS-type interaction. This model is used because it allows for a quick estimation of the gap value and as we will show, gives an excellent fit to the data. The inclusion of the weighting function allows for a better fit with the experimental data in the gap region than with the non-weighted average as was done previously. Here, a weighting function f (θ) = 1 + 0.4cos(4θ) was used which imposes a preferential angular selection of the DOS along the absolute maximum of the d-wave gap and tapers off towards the nodes of the gap. This is a rather weak directional function since the minimum of f (θ) along the nodes of the d-wave gap is still non-negligible."
27,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,13,"The second method (Model II) makes no attempt to normalize out any background conductance. Rather, an attempt is made to fit the entire spectrum by including a band structure, tunneling matrix element, and d-wave gap symmetry. The tunneling DOS is calculated using the single particle Green's function, For the superconducting state, where u 2 k and v 2 k are the usual coherence factors, Γ is the quasiparticle lifetime broadening factor, and k with the gap function for d-wave symmetry ∆(k) = ∆ o [cos(k x a) − cos(k y a)]/2 . The tunneling matrix element |T k | 2 is written as where v g is the group velocity defined as v g = |∇ k ξ k • n| and D(k) is the directionality function that has the form Here the unit vector n defines the tunneling direction, which is perpendicular to the plane of the junction, whereas θ o corresponds to the angular spread in k-space of the quasiparticle momenta with respect to n that has a non-negligible tunneling probability. The band structure for the Cu−O plane extracted from ARPES measurements on Bi-2212 is used. Presumably, other than the exact value of the chemical potential, the band structure for Tl-2201 should have the same generic features as the extracted band structure from Bi-2212. Unlike a similar analysis done in our earlier report, the presence of the VHS is not artificially removed by using a large chemical potential. Rather, the presence of the VHS is effectively diminished by the group velocity factor from the tunneling matrix element. Here, the value of the chemical potential has been altered slightly to produce the best comparison to the experimental data. The tunneling DOS from this model is compared directly to the experimental conductance data using a constant scaling factor. An interesting aspect of this second model is the robust asymmetric quasiparticle peaks in the tunneling DOS. This asymmetry, which has the higher peak in the filled states, is a direct consequence of the d-wave gap symmetry and directionality in the model. As will be shown, this result is consistent with our experimental tunneling data."
28,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,14,"Figures present two representative SIN tunneling conductances of Tl-2201. Figure shows Junction E of Fig. , while Figure is an additional conductance curve (Junction J) not shown in Fig. that has a very high peak height to background ratio. As illustrated in Figs. , the SIN conductance data consistently display the sharp, cusp-like subgap feature, weakly decreasing background, and conductance peaks that are either weakly or strongly asymmetric, with the higher peak on the negative bias side. The presence of these features and the overall shape of the conductance data are very similar to the conductance data of Fig. in our earlier report. To compare the two data sets to Model I, the SIN conductance data are first normalized by dividing through with an extrapolated normal state conductance curve which is shown as the solid line in Fig. . The normalized conductances are then compared to the DOS obtained from Model I as shown in Fig. . Other than a remaining conductance peak asymmetry and somewhat broader experimental peaks, the model DOS shows a remarkably good overall fit in the gap region with the experimental DOS. Notice that while the process of normalization has reduced the degree of asymmetry of the conductance peaks in both data sets, it has not eliminated it. This proves that the asymmetry is not a consequence of the background."
29,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,15,"The comparison of Model II with the unnormalized tunneling data is shown in Fig. . The most striking observation is the model's ability to reproduce the peak asymmetry that is seen in the data. As was shown in Ref. , this type of asymmetry with the higher peak in the filled states is a robust property of d-wave gap symmetry and directional tunneling. The strength of the directionality here is defined by θ o and the values used to compare both experimental data here are considerably larger than the ones used to analyze the Bi-2212 data. This implies that these two data sets are best fit with a weak directional tunneling processes which is consistent with the type of weighting function f (θ) in Model I."
30,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,16,"As in Bi-2212, Model II could not accurately reproduce the background conductance although it does show the generic decreasing background seen in both data sets. This may also be due to the fact that we are not using the exact normal state band structure for Tl-2201 in the model. Model II also produces a poorer agreement with the subgap data which might be due to the particular choice of directionality function used. Note that the values of the energy gap from both models are very close to each other, with the Model I having a slightly lower gap values than Model II."
31,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,17,"We would like to point out that attempts at comparing the normalized experimental data with just a pure d-wave gap symmetry without the f (θ) weighting function in the Model I led to a poorer fit to the data. Considering this, we reanalyze some of the SIN tunneling data from our previous report (Junction B and C in Fig. of Ref. and relabeled here as Junction B' and C' respectively). We have restricted this analysis by using only Model I. Figure shows the raw SIN conductance data of Junction B' and the estimated normal state conductance used to obtain the normalized data. This normalized curve is shown in Fig. along with the comparison to Model I. The model produces a better fit in the gap region (with identical gap value) when compared to our earlier fit. This procedure is repeated for Junction C' as shown in Fig. (which has been normalized by a constant). In this case, the overall fit is only slightly improved over the one we reported earlier, with an identical gap value."
32,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,18,"One of the distinct features of the tunneling DOS in Bi-2212 is the strong dip beyond the quasiparticle peak in the occupied states. This feature is clearly seen in SIN conductance data of Bi-2212 from both STM and PCT. Furthermore, this dip feature is enhanced in the superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) junction. This is apparent from the break junction tunneling data in Ref. . Our SIN conductance data of Tl-2201 from this work and in our previous report do not seem to distinctively show the same dip features, although there is evidence of a weak dip feature in the normalized data of Figs. as well as junctions C and G in Fig. . We explore this issue further by generating SIS conductance curves from the raw data of Junction E and Junction B' which should enhance any dip feature that may exists in these SIN data. As shown in Fig. , both conductance data generate SIS curves that are qualitatively similar to the experimental SIS tunneling data of Bi-2212. Both curves clearly display the prominent dip features located at slightly less than 3∆. This indicates that the dip feature is also present in the SIN conductance data of Tl-2201 but at a smaller amplitude than the ones observed in the SIN data of Bi-2212."
33,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,19,"Another significant difference between the tunneling data of Bi-2212 and Tl-2201 is the magnitude of the supercon- ducting gap and this might be related to the dip feature discussed above. The optimally-doped Bi-2212 which has a T c of 93-95 K has an energy gap in the range of 37-38 meV. Due to the high reproducibility of the gap value for Bi-2212, it is presumed that the gap value for Bi-2212 is consistent with its T c . Tl-2201 which has a bulk T c of 86 K in this study and 91 K in the previous study, has an energy gap in the range of 19-25 meV. This value is considerably less than the energy gap of Bi-2212 even though bulk T c for both cuprates are roughly the same. This discrepancy raises an important question in HTS cuprates, namely the relationship between gap size ∆(T = 0) and T c . The unusual ∆ versus doping in Bi-2212, which violates mean-field theory, strongly suggest that T c is a phase coherence temperature. In this picture, there are strong superconducting fluctuations above T c and presumably the ability of each HTS to support such fluctuations depends on structural parameters, anistropy and the degree of 2-dimensionality. It is thus possible that there is no universal relationship between ∆ and T c for all HTS. If there exists a universal relationship between these two parameters for HTS cuprates as is approximately the case for conventional superconductors, then the difference in the gap size between these two HTS's needs another explanation. It is possible, due to the strength of the interplane bonding, that the tunneling measurement is probing predominantly the surface of the Tl-2201 crystals which has been exposed to air and may have properties different from the bulk. This raises the possibility that the surface of Tl-2201 may be slightly overdoped, which results in a smaller gap size. When Bi-2212 is annealed in air it has a T c ∼86 K and is slightly overdoped. This is the equilibrium oxygen doping level at atmospheric conditions and a similar situation is found for Tl-2201. Air annealed Tl-2201 has a T c ∼82 K. Therefore, air-exposed Tl-2201 will have a tendency for the surface to be somewhat overdoped by coming to equilibrium with atmospheric conditions. We are then suggesting that when the sample is cooled down to 4.2 K, there are no changes in the surface concentration. Of course we have no proof of this. If there are changes in the surface concentrations upon cooling in vacuum, then these changes are highly reproducible because both Bi-2212 and Tl-2201 display highly reproducible spectra and gap values."
34,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,20,"Furthermore, the strength of the dip feature seems to indicate that the surface is slightly overdoped. In Bi- 2212, tunneling conductances exhibiting gap sizes of 35-40 meV exhibit dip strength of approximately 80% of the background conductance. For smaller gaps in the range of 15-20 meV (which are from overdoped Bi-2212), the dip strength is approximately 10%. This is consistent with what is observed in Fig. for Tl-2201 and seems to support our argument that the surface of Tl-2201 crystals we measured is slightly overdoped. This however, is still speculation and requires further detailed study to account for the apparent gap size discrepancy. We note that preliminary temperature dependent data indicate that junctions which exhibit small gaps (∼ 20 meV) also show a strong smearing out of the gap feature at a temperature below the bulk T c."
35,PHC3200009-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,21,"To summarize, we have performed SIN tunneling junction measurements on single crystals of Tl-2201 with bulk T c of 86 K. The conductance data obtained reproducibly show cusp-like subgap features, asymmetric conductance peaks and weakly decreasing backgrounds. These observations are consistent with our earlier report on Tl-2201 with a T c of 91 K that were synthesized in a different manner. The present data are fit reasonably well with two different models using the d-wave gap symmetry. The need for a weighting function in Model I and the prominent asymmetry of the data which is reproduced in Model II seem to indicate that the tunneling process in these cases may have a weak preferential tunneling direction centered at or near the absolute maximum of the d-wave gap. The magnitude of the superconducting gap for this cuprate is noticeably smaller than the gap size of optimally-doped Bi-2212 that has similar T c . The existence of a universal relationship between the superconducting gap size and T c is still undetermined, and therefore the origin of the discrepancy between the gap size of these two cuprates is still uncertain."

Although the original composition is Na 0.74 CoO 2 , the actual composition was determined to be Na 0.7 CoO 2 by the atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and the Na + ion-selective electrode (ISE) techniques.

The value of x depends on the equilibrium concentrations of Br 2 , Br − , and Na + , provided the reaction time is long enough (over 48 hours for polycrystalline samples).

In this study, we employed both routes to synthesize the hydrated compound in order to make a compar- ison.

XRD measurement for the sample annealed at 673 K in air shows that Co 3 O 4 is separated out, like the case in . So, the loss of weight at ∼ 605 K corresponds to the following equation, Since Co 3 O 4 decomposes at about 1180 K in air, the weight-loss at 1184 K is ascribed to the decomposition of Co 3 O 4 , It is noted that the theoretical weight-losses based on Eqs.

Since the sodium content was determined to be 0.22 for the WLH sample (see below), the water content for this compound is thus estimated to be 0.85. This value is obviously lower than the common value ∼ 1.3 . On the contrary, the water content for the WVH compound is determined as 2.3, which is remarkably higher than that of previous reports. We suspect that free water had been absorbed in the WVH sample. It is noted that the ratio of weight-loss at 1184 K and 1291 K is quite different for the two hydrated samples. This is because that the sodium content in the WLH compound is lower than that in the WVH sample."

In the ISE measurement, the sample was dissolved in acid solution, and then the solution was neutralized by (CH 3 ) 2 CHNH 2 to eliminate the disturbance of H 3 O + . Both measurements show that the sodium content for the WLH compound is 0.22, which is 1/3 smaller than that of the WVH one."

It can be seen that the liberated Na + increases with increasing the reaction time. During the first 10 hours of the hydration, Na + concentration increases rapidly. Then, it increases gradually until the sat- uration at 0.01 mol/L when t=120 hours. It was also noted that the pH value increases from 9.0 at the beginning of the hydration to 12.0 when the reaction completed. That is to say, NaOH is gradually liberated during the hydration reaction. Considered that the hydration is not a redox reaction, therefore, H + has to be incorporated in the hydrated product. By using the above TGA re- sult, the WLH compound can be expressed as Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O, and the hydration can be described as Apparently, the equation above consists of the ion-exchange of Na + and H + . So, it is not strange that the content of the incorporated proton was found to alter with the change of the concentration of NaOH in the reactor. When the NaOH was removed, the content of the incorporated proton could increase up to 0.15. On the contrary, in the case of high NaOH concentration, the amount of the incorporated H + will be reduced. Note that free water may exist in the WVH sample, we speculate that small amount of proton might be also incorporated in the Na 0.32 CoO 2 • 2.3H 2 O phase."
55,SSC1310125-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,14,"Now, let us discuss the possible crystal structure of Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O. As we know, the anhydrus parent compound Na 0.32 CoO 2 consists of triangular CoO 2 layers in which cobalt is octahedrally coordinated. Partially-occupied Na + is sandwiched by the CoO 2 layers. Water can be intercalated between CoO 2 layers and Na + layers when the sodium is deintercalated to some ex- tent. By using neutron diffractions, detailed structural models were estab- lished . Impressively, Jorgensen et. al. proposed that the position of Na + was shifted in such a way to accommodate the tetrahedral coordina- tions by water molecules. In this model, the ideal Na to H 2 O ratio is 1:4, which also satisfies the chemical formula Na0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O."
56,SSC1310125-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,15,"So, we think that similar structure is probable for the present WLH compound. Another problem concerns about the position of the incorporated H + . From chemical bonding point of view, H + may bond with the oxygen in H 2 O to form H 3 O + , or, bond with the oxygen in CoO 2 layers to form the OH groups. We have measured the IR spectra, but no definite conclusion can be drawn about the bonding of the H + . The longer c-axis of Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 •0.85H 2 O compared with that of Na 0.32 CoO 2 • 2.3H 2 O can be explained in terms of Coulomb attractions between the Na + layers and CoO 2 layers. One would expect that relatively weak Coulomb at- tractions along the c-axis for Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O due to the relatively less electric charge in the Na + and CoO 2 layers. So, though the water content is not high in Na 0.22 H 0.1 CoO 2 • 0.85H 2 O, the c-axis parameter can be even larger than that of Na 0.32 CoO 2 • 2.3H 2 O."

The fresh pellet shows no superconducting transi- tion above 1.9 K, however, after the very same sample was placed in humid environment at room temperature over a period of time, superconductivity was recovered. Moreover, T c increases with increasing the placement time. Therefore, it should be careful to draw any conclusions on the relationship between T c and the factors, such as water and sodium content. We checked the XRD patterns for the as-pressed and the as-placed pellets. Both data in- dicates single phase of c=19.7Å , however, the as-pressed sample shows very broad diffraction peaks, and the broad peaks change back into sharp ones for the as-placed sample.

This roughness is quite close to the freshly cleaved surface of a Bi2212 single crystal with an rms surface roughness of 0.20 nm . For Bi2212 thin films with a similar thickness prepared by MBE, the mean surface roughness is between 0.5 and 0.9 nm across an area of 10 × 10 µm 2 . It is clear that even after the Ar-ion etching the surface quality of the single crystals is better than that of thin films of comparable thickness grown by MBE.

Strictly speaking, we should take into account some contribution from the c-axis resistivity also because the electrodes are only attached to one side of the highly anisotropic single crystal and the bias current should flow along the c-axis before getting into the bridge .

Unlike most dopants, Zn substitutes for Cu on the planes and causes significant changes to the local electronic structure without much change of hole concentration . In the superconducting state Zn substitution dramatically changes both the transition temperature and the temperature dependence of the low-temperature penetration depth . NMR and mag- netization measurements in the normal state suggested that Zn induces a weak magnetic moment µ ef f =0.32 to 0.36 µ B /Zn for fully oxygenated crystals, and that this moment increases as the oxygen content decreases . An oxygen reduced sample (O 6.66 ) which exhibited a spin gap showed a moment of 0.86µ B /Zn . A model in which each Zn atom effects the local magnetic order of nearby copper atoms on the scale of the magnetic cop- per correlation length (which varies with δ) explains the normal-state magnetic measurements on this system . In the superconducting state, NMR measurements sug- gested that in Zn substituted YBCO there exists a finite electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level . Early specific heat measurements seemed to agreed with this conclusion indicating increased DOS in the su- perconducting state in Zn substituted samples."
100,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,3,"Simple valence counting suggests that if the Zn impu- rity maintains a nominal Cu 2+ charge, the Zn 2+ would have a (3d) , S=0 configuration and act as a nonmag- netic impurity. Thus, it is important to understand whether a nonmagnetic impurity can induce a local mo- ment on the surrounding Cu 2+ sites. Early theoreti- cal treatment of the problem expected that a nonmag- netic impurity can only induce a local moment when the ""mother"" phase has a spin gap . Further studies of this problem concluded that in a doped antiferromag- net with no spin gap an induced localized magnetization will exist around the impurity but it does not correspond to a free moment. At low enough temperatures where the staggered correlation length is larger than the local- ization length associated with the impurity distortion, this localized moment is always aligned with the local staggered order . While the question of whether the magnetic moments exist in a global sense and in par- ticular whether the moments are observable below the superconducting transition temperature is still an open question, new theoretical ideas argue that the moments may be partially screened below the spin gap and fully screened deep in the superconducting state in the cuprates. Recently, there has been some theoretical work done considering the fact of a possible Kondo-screening. In a conventional s-wave superconductor, the Kondo ef- fect is suppressed by the formation of the superconduct- ing gap, as shown by Abrikosov and Gorkov . In d- wave superconductors, however, there are quasiparticles in the node lines which could cause a Kondo screening. Indeed, Fradkin and Cassanello recently calculated the thermodynamic properties of a d-wave superconductors with magnetic impurities . They predicted a screen- ing mechanism analogous to the exchange coupling be- tween magnetic impurities and the electrons in a Fermi liquid that causes the Kondo effect. In the clean limit, the Dirac like quasiparticles and the magnetic impurity form a singlet state. The screening is only effective above a critical exchange coupling , because in contrast to the Kondo effect in metals, the density of states of normal quasiparticles in a d-wave superconductor vanishes at the Fermi surface. In this limit, the magnetic susceptibilty disappears superlinearly, hence the effect can be consid- ered as overscreening."
101,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,4,"Observing the effect of a low concentration of Zn dop- ing on the magnetic behavior of the cuprates in the su- perconducting state is practically impossible due to the strong signal associated with the vortex state. However, applying a magnetic field will split the free Zn-induced moments into a two-level system and a Schottky anomaly should be apparent in the low temperature specific heat. In the present paper we provide a comprehensive study of the effect of Zn impurities on the behavior of low-lying electronic excitations in YBCO. To this end we study the specific heat of pure, 0.15%, 0.31% and 1% Zn-doped single crystals YBCO samples. We extend earlier mea- surements on Zn-doped polycrystalline YBCO samples. Compared to pure YBCO we find that: i) The linear-T term, which has been regularly observed in specific heat measurements of YBCO is greatly increased. This result is only qualitatively consistent with the ""dirty d- wave"" scenario used to explain the penetration depth measurements and the suppression of T c . ii) The T 3 term decreases, suggesting either a surprisingly large increase in the Debye temperature or a new electronic contribution with a similar temperature dependence. iii) A low temperature upturn T −2 below ∼3.5 K is observed. This upturn is seen in many specific heat measurements , though , its origin is still unclear. iv) The most intriguing result of our measurements is that there is no apparent increase in the number of free magnetic mo- ments as indicated by a Schottky anomaly in any of the Zn-doped samples as compared with the pure sample. Normal state measurements of the magnetization of the 1% sample is in agreement with previous measurements indicating a magnetic moment of the size ∼0.36 µ B /Zn. From these results, we conclude that the magnetic mo- ments that exist in the normal state must be screened at low temperatures in the superconducting state."

This method gives an accuracy of 0.01 -0.02% Zn per Cu. With increasing Zn-doping, the T c is suppressed by ∆T c ∼12K/% Zn. Magnetic measure- ments showed that in our 1% sample the T c is suppressed by 12 K. Specific heat data were taken using the relax- ation method, which especially allows the measurement of relatively small samples.

103,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,6,"Specific heat data on the Zn-doped YBCO crystal were taken between 2 and 12 K at zero field and between 2 and 8 K at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 Tesla. The specific heat was measured as a function of temperature at constant mag- netic field which was applied above T c before cooling the sample. The zero-field results are shown in figure , plot- ted as c(T )/T vs. T 2 and compared with pure (0% Zn) samples. In this representation, for a normal metal, the slope β is the coefficient of the lattice T 3 term and the intercept γ is the coefficient of the linear electronic heat capacity and proportional to its density of states. Devi- ations from this γT + βT 3 behavior are not very notice- able for the nominally pure sample, but with increasing Zn concentration the samples show a low-temperature upturn below ∼3 K. Also, from a visual observation, the curves for the Zn-doped samples have larger γ, and smaller β suggesting higher electronic density of states and higher Debye temperatures with increasing Zn con- centration. While the cause of the low-temperature up- turn is still unknown, there are some indications that it is related to interaction between paramagnetic impurities and a local field or a result of collective behavior of these impurities . This is supported by our finding that this upturn is somewhat influenced by the quality of the sample. Previous reports of early samples of YBCO, showed a much larger low-temperature upturn in the spe- cific heat, thus, a straightforward fitting of the data at higher temperatures (e.g. ≥ 5 K) to avoid the upturn will result in misleading values of both the γT term and the βT 3 term . Although the ""upturn effect"" is not too large below 3.5 K, and does not effect our overall data, we still include it in our analysis as discussed below."
104,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,7,"The magnetic field dependence is shown in figure for the 1% Zn sample. The lower Zn concentration samples show similar behavior. The most notable result here is the further increase in the extrapolated intercept with the c(T )/T axis, an indication of further increase in the quasi-particles density of states upon the application of magnetic field. Based on our previous results on pure YBCO crystals we first attempt the general fit: where we omitted the T 2 term for the Zn doped samples as we no longer expect to have clean lines of nodes, and we attempt to account for the uncertainty in the upturn by allowing the power law used to describe it to vary as T −N where N=1,2. In these equations, β is field in- dependent and the βT 3 term is assumed to result from phonons. c Sch (T, H) is a Schottky anomaly associated with a field-independent molar concentration ν Sch of free spin-1/2 moments. Finally, we have a free function γ(H)."
105,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,8,"For pure samples, the coefficient of this linear-T term is found to obey γ(H) = γ(0) +γ(H) where γ(0) decreases as twin boundaries and oxygen vacancies are removed from the crystal (for O 6.99 , γ(0) ∼ 1 mJ/mol-K 2 ), and γ(H) ∝ H 1/2 with a coefficient which agrees semiquan- titatively with the prediction for lines of nodes . For the low temperature upturn, in fitting only the zero-field data, the best fit was obtained with N=2. However, a global fit using data of all fields for a given Zn concen- tration results in a best fit with N=1. As our results and in particular the conclusions based on the results were not sensitive to the choice of N, we used N=1 in all of the following data analyses. In general we found that the field dependence of the 1/T low temperature upturn is not consistent with increasing spin-1/2 impurities: it does not change dramatically with applied field and does not become a Schottky-like term either. The coefficients that we obtained in this fit are given in Table ."
106,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,9,"Starting our analysis with the effect of Zn-doping on β , we find that β = 0.308, 0.284, and 0.274 mJ/mol-K 4 for the 0.15%, 0.31% and 1% Zn doped samples respec- tively, as compared with 0.392± 0.001 mJ/mol-K 4 for the nominally pure sample. If this T 3 term is only asso- ciated with phonons, it corresponds to an increase in the Debye temperature from 403 K in the nominally pure sample to 454 K in the 1% Zn-doped sample. Such a large increase is very surprising and may indicate that a portion of the T 3 term is electronic in nature. The linear term, γ(0)T , also increases with Zn doping. The zero-field linear-T term increases from 3.0 mJ/mol-K 2 in the nominally pure sample to 4.3, 5.8 and 11.7 mJ/mol- K 2 in the 0.15%, 0.31% and 1% Zn doped samples re- spectively. Assuming a normal state linear T coefficient γ n ∼20 mJ/mol-K 2 , this implies a residual density of states ratios n res = N (E F )/N n of 0.066, 0.14, and 0.43 for the three crystals (here N (E F ) is the density of states at the Fermi level and N n is the density of states in the normal state that results in that γ n ). From penetration depth measurements of crystals from the same batches , an analysis based on a ""dirty d-wave"" found a scattering parameter Γ/T c ≃ 0.018-0.030 for 0.31% Zn doping and Γ/T c ≃ 0.006-0.009 for the 0.15% Zn dop- ing. In the limit of strong resonant scattering the dirty d-wave model predicts Γ ∝ n 2 res with a logarithmic cor- rection of order ln(T c n res /Γ) . Ref. shows reasonable agreement with that prediction using penetration depth data of 0.15% and 0.31%. To analyze the specific heat we first need to estimate the ""Zn-like"" impurities in the nominally pure sample. Again, the penetration depth of similar samples give a scattering parameter Γ/T c of about 0.0008 which corresponds to an impurity concen- tration of 0.013% and a residual density of states ratio of 0.03, which implies a contribution of ∼0.6 mJ/mol-K 2 to the zero-field linear term. The residual ∼2.4 mJ/mol-K 2 most probably come from the unfilled chains as was found by measuring the high oxygen content crystals . Us- ing the above data figure shows the change of the zero field linear term from the Zn-free sample ( ∆γ(0) ) as a function of the Zn concentration. For comparison we also show in figure the expected ∆γ(0) expected from ""dirty d-wave"" theory . While as for the penetration depth data, the low Zn concentration fits the ""dirty d- wave"" theory reasonably well, stronger deviation appears for the 1% sample indicating a more linear dependence on the Zn concentration. Table summarizes the results presented above."
107,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,10,"For pure samples, the field dependent coefficient of the linear-T term obeys γ(H) = γ(0) +γ(H). Whileγ ∝ H 1/2 for pure samples, Zn doping alters this behavior and the 1% Zn sample showedγ ∝ H as is shown in figure . This suppression of the H 1/2 term was expected because of increased scattering. In Volovik's work , the H 1/2 magnetic field dependence of the density of states results from the use of the intervortex spacing as a cutoff to the spatial integral over the density of states in the vortex. For the large Zn concentration such as our 1% sample we expect a much shorter cutoff length. In the unitary limit the scattering rate at low frequencies (and temperatures) saturates at a value ℓ ∼ v F n res /2Γ . Using our results for Γ we find that this length is of order 100Å, thus explaining the linear field dependence."
108,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,11,"Finally we turn to the search of the Zn induced mag- netic moments. As noted in the introduction the Zn- induced impurities are expected to be observed in finite magnetic field specific heat measurements. For a two- level system this is a Schottky-like anomaly given by: where ∆ is the size of the two-level system gap. Clearly a true two level system exists for spin 1/2 impurities only. In the case of Zn impurities we expect an effective mo- ment of order one Bohr-magneton , hence, a simplified two-level system with a moment µ and a gap ∆ = 2µH should be a good approximation for the expected efect on the specific heat. Also in equation 2, ν Sch is the mo- lar concentration of moments and R is the gas constant. Impurity moments are always found in specific heat mea- surements of high-T c materials even for ""pure"" crystals. For optimally doped YBCO a concentration of about 0.05% -0.1% per copper atom is found . For higher oxygen concentration this number is smaller providing us with evidence that most of these moments come from un- compensated copper atoms in the chains. As mentioned above, it has been argued that Zn impurities induce mo- ments that for the concentration range and oxygen level of our samples is expected to be µ = 0.32µ B to 0.36µ B . Thus, it is easy to calculate the expected Schottky anomaly associated with the Zn moments; in particular we expect that since the Zn moments originate from the Cu-O planes and the ""unaccounted"" spin-1/2 moments come from the chains the Zn contribution will simply be an addition to the pure crystal heat capacity. With the above introduction, the most surprising result is that we did not find any change in the Schottky anomaly for any of the Zn doping all the way to 8 Tesla, the maxi- mum field we measured. This result can most dramat- ically be seen in figure where the specific heat data at 8 Tesla is plotted together with the calculated Schot- tky anomaly expected for 1% Zn with magnetic moment per Zn of µ = 0.32µ B (the smaller expected contribu- tion). Also plotted in figure is a Schottky anomaly with µ = 1.28µ B , displaying the possibility of a ""composite"" moment that results from local ferromagnetic interaction of moments on four neighboring oxygen atoms . If a significant amount of either 0.32µ B or 1.28µ B moments were present, it would be readily apparent in the size of the Schottky anomaly, which is unchanged from undoped samples. Fitting with a Schottky term with 1.28µ B mo- ments in addition to the 1µ B -spin-1/2 anomaly finds no more than 0.02% additional spins per Cu and is con- sistent with no 1.28µ B moments at all. At 0.32µ B per moment, the presence of 1% spins per Cu would create a Schottky tail which wouldn't roll over at even the high- est fields and lowest temperatures measured. However, this upturn would increase proportionally to the square of the applied field, being 16 times larger at 8 Tesla than at 2 Tesla. Assuming that all of the low temperature up- turn in the 8 Tesla data is from a small-moment Schottky anomaly, we obtain an upper limit of 0.03% spins per Cu, for 0.32µ B moment spins. Figure highlights this dis- crepancy, showing that even with different fitting meth- ods, there are few, if any, of the Zn impurities creating free magnetic moments in the crystal."
109,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,12,"The absence of Zn-induced magnetic moments in the superconducting state may be explained in two ways. The first is that the moments exist only in a local sense and thus will be found in local measurements such as Knight shift but will be missed in bulk measurements such as the present specific heat due to the ""spread"" of the moment throughout the whole sample . To check for this hypothesis we measured the susceptibility of the 1%-Zn doped sample. A weak Curie behavior was found which is of similar magnitude to that measured by Zagoulaev et al. implying a similar size of magnetic moment per Zn impurity. The fact that the Zn-moments exist in the normal state may be explained by the fact that we have been measuring a doped Heisenberg antifer- romagnet which is close to optimal doping, and for which the spin gap has not collapsed yet."
110,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,13,"The second possibility for the ""disappearance"" of the moments is that they are screened in a Kondo fashion. Such a possibility was recently considered by Nagaosa and Lee and by Cassanello and Fradkin . Rele- vant to our measurements is the Cassanello and Fradkin work in which they postulated that magnetic impurities in a clean d-wave superconductor will be screened, and show that the screening can be described as a multichan- nel non-marginal Kondo problem. For simplicity they as- sume spin-1/2 impurities that are located on the Cu sites in the planes. Using expected values of the exchange cou- pling, they find a critical temperature T K ∼ 10 K, below which the impurities will be overscreened. Their calcu- lation of the low-temperature specific heat yielded the expressions: Here ν i is the impurity concentration per mole, R is the universal gas constant, ζ(3) is the Rieman zeta function of argument 3, N c is the rank of the symmetry group of the impurity spin, taken to be 2 in the relevant case (see for details), δ is a dimensionless parameter related to the strength of the screening ( the singlet amplitude), ∆ 0 is the maximum gap of the d x 2 −y 2 superconductor, and T K is the Kondo temperature associated with the impurities. Before presenting our fit to the Cassanello and Fradkin's calculation we note that the calculation are based on a very simple model that assumes that the quasiparticles that screen the moments come from the nodes only. However, Zn impurities cause the depression of the order parameter close to the impurity site due to potential scattering (i.e. pair breaking). This effect is the main cause of the depression of T c , and was not included in the calculations. However, all the effects related to Zn scattering are local in nature and thus should reduce to a generalized Andreev boundary condition (general- ized because of the different symmetries that may be in- volved, including inter-node scattering and so on). It is very unlikely that these effects will help in the Kondo screening since these potentials are invariant under spin rotations . With the above discussion in mind we fitted our Zn-doped specific heat data with the screen- ing model, i.e. equations 3. Since the model provides us with the limiting cases only for temperature and fields we first fit the high field, assuming that all the field depen- dence comes from the screening. We then introduce an interpolation function that is exponential in nature which connects the low and high magnetic fields. We show the results of the fit in figure while the fitting parameters are shown in TABLE . Again, compared with Zn-free sample the Schottky anomaly does not change, the T 3 contribution is smaller and a small low temperature up- turn is observed. For the 1%Zn we find (δ/T K )= 0.0082, a value within the range discussed in . For that sam- ple we also find that the quality of the fit degrades at high fields, possibly due to the model becoming invalid with the relatively large DOS at the nodes and its si- multaneous smearing by the Zn doping and the magnetic field. For the 0.31%Zn the value (δ/T K )= 0.003 seems somewhat low as we expected to first approximation that the two values will be the same."
111,PR06103604-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,14,"In conclusion, we presented in this paper a comprehen- sive study of the low temperature heat capacity of Zn- doped YBCO single crystals. Several trends have been found as a function of Zn doping. The T 3 term decreases with increasing Zn while the liner term increasing, in- dicating an increasing DOS at the nodes. This residual density of states is only qualitatively consistent with a d-wave resonant scattering theory. The 1%Zn clearly de- viates from the theoretical expectation, showing excess DOS. A low temperature upturn is consistently observed for the Zn-doped samples, similar to early measurements on more disordered YBCO samples. The cause and exact form of this upturn is still not clear. The most surprising result of our study tough is that no Schottky anomaly is observed for the presumed magnetic moments created by Zn doping. Based on a recent theory by Cassanello and Fradkin we fitted the data with Kondo screened mo- ments. The relatively good quality of the fit and the rea- sonable parameters extracted from it give us confidence that indeed Zn-moments in YBCO crystals are screened by quasiparticles in the nodes of the d x 2 −y 2 superconduc- tor."

In the last case , the observation that the magnetic in- tensity decreases at large momentum more rapidly than does the Cu-spin form factor, has been considered to support the suggestion of orbital moments of a d-wave density-wave (DDW) order parameter (that could be the hidden order responsible for the ""pseudo-gap phase"" of underdoped cuprates) . However, in the cuprates, the real coexistence of magnetic order and superconductiv- ity or a microscopic phase segregation remains a matter of discussion.

Each added Co atom, with an average coordination number of 5, pulls in 0.5 oxygen atoms . Additionally, the Co substitution induces a trans- verse distortion of its Cu(1) site . Co atoms tend to form either small clusters like dimers or even short chains along the (110) direction . As a result, these chains pin down the twin boundaries of the or- thorhombic structure (micro-twinning) that triggers an orthorhombic-tetragonal transition for y ≥ 0.025 . NMR and transport measurements show the cobalt substitution reduces the hole doping. However, for the low Co substitution level (y ≃ 0.013) examined here, despite the decrease in the Hall effect derived car- rier density and in the specific heat derived conden- sate density , the doping is still high enough for T c to remain at its optimum value. In addition, Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) measurements have evidenced the appearance of magnetic moments on the Cu of the Cu(1) sites and more surprisingly on those of the Cu(2) sites as well.

There are a number of arguments against this hypothesis. As the magnetic correlation length exceeds 200Å, then the Co would be essentially concentrated within these clusters. Such Co clusters would yield an observable magnetic diffraction pattern. The local Co concentration would also be quite high and we would expect to observe the be- havior seen in samples having high Co levels.

After subtraction of the scan just above T c from that at low temperature, the remaining intensity was fitted to a Gaussian profile centered at the AF wave vector. For both types of con- stant energy scans reported in , the AF response at 39 meV in the superconducting state displays a mo- mentum width (FWHM) of 0.28 ± 0.06Å −1 .

The magnetic resonance peak is not sharp in energy and can be fitted by the usual ""ansatz"" of a single Gaussian line- shape: this yields an intrinsic energy width of ∼ 9 ± 1 meV (FWHM). This analysis in terms of a single broad signal centered at E r is supported by the temperature de- pendences performed at the AF wave vector at 42 meV and 35 meV (6 meV below E r ) which both show a simi- lar decrease of the AF response up to T c .

Such a phase segregation scenario has some analogies with the three phase model developed to explain the Cu-NQR data . However, the magnetic correlation lengths found here (ξ > 200Å) are much bigger than the dimensions of the nucleated regions where the Cu(2) become magnetic as considered in ref. . In addition, Kohno et al. have proposed a phenomenological description of AF-SC coexistent states due to disorder in strongly correlated systems. In their model, based on Ginsburg-Landau the- ory, a key assumption is that the SC state is in competi- tion with the AF phase with a first order phase bound- ary, which enables the AF state to nucleate where SC is suppressed. For a finite concentration of impurities, the first order AF-SC boundary of the clean case is re- placed by a finite region where the SC and AF moments coexist microscopically with spatially varying order pa- rameters. It has also been proposed that an AF state can locally appear around surfaces or impurities and can co-exist with d-wave superconductivity and in particular, the local formation of an AF order parameter can easily occur near a (110) surface. The AF order in the present case could have its origin in the magnetic polarisation produced by the Co 3+ or in the structural effects related to the micro-twinning along the (110) directions or more probably, to a combination of both these effects."

A structural unit of cation-layers is stacked in a sequence of -HgO-BaO-CuO-Ca-along the c-axis. The substitution of Hg by Pb enhances the stability of the Hg-1223 phase because the high steam pressure of Hg lowers the chemical stability in synthesis. However, the doping into Hg layers is related to an interstitial oxygen defect. On the other hand, the substitution of Ba by Sr improves the hole doping of CuO2 planes. Thus, the element substitution in Hg and Ba sites becomes a key factor in synthesizing high-quality superconductors. Therefore, the cation distribution in the two sites has been examined by the two- wavelengths anomalous dispersion (TWAD) method of synchrotron X-ray resonant scattering. Single crystals of Hg-1223 were grown at T = 1130 K by the liquid-assisted solid-state recrystallization method from the precursor powder prepared by spray drying or evaporation of the nitrate solutions. Oxygen contents in the precursors were determined by iodometric titrations. Four samples of Hg0.45Pb0.30Ba1.63Sr0.50Ca1.94Cu3O8 ( Tc = 128 K), Hg0.42Pb0.41Ba1.19Sr1.06Ca1.97Cu3O8 (125 K), Hg0.50Pb0.50Ba0.59Sr1.24Ca1.83Cu3.34O8 (116 K) and Hg0.34Pb0.54Ba0.61Sr1.17Ca1.88Cu3O8 (115 K) were selected for single- crystal intensity measurements. A conventional measurement to determine the Ba-site occupancy was made to use a Rigaku AFC-5 four-circle diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation. After the absorption correction by the arbitrary-shape grid-integration method, crystal-structure refinements were successfully performed with R factors ranging 6.4 to 6.7 %. The site preference of Hg, Pb and Cu in the Hg site was determined with a vertical-type four-circle diffractometer in PF-BL-10A, where wavelengths of λ = 1.3906 and 1.0191 Å were used at Cu K and Hg LIII absorption edges, respectively. In the TWAD method with least-squares calculations, a variation of the residual factors gives a minimum against the contents of Hg or Cu, suggesting, for example, that Cu does not occupy the Hg site for all samples. In the presentation the site preference and structural change will be discussed in the aspects of superconductivity."

At ambient pressure, the Cu-substitution is known to suppress the spin density wave (SDW) phase in pure BaFe 2 As 2 (T SDW ≈ 140 K) and to induce a superconducting (SC) dome with a maximum transition temperature T max c 4.2 K. This T max c is much lower than the T c ∼ 15-28 K achieved in the case of Ru, Ni and Co substitutions. Such a lower T c is attributed to a Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking effect. The latter is strongly suppressed by applied pressure, as shown herein, T c can be significantly enhanced by applying high pressures. In this work, we investigated the pressure effects on Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking in the BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 series. Around the optimal concentration (x opd = 0.11), all samples showed a substantial increase of T c as a function of pressure. Yet for those samples with a slightly higher doping level (over-doped regime), T c presented a dome-like shape with maximum T c 8 K. Remarkably interesting, the under-doped samples, e.g. x = 0.02 display a maximum pressure induced T c 30 K which is comparable to the maximum T c 's found for the pure compound under external pressures. Furthermore, the magnetoresistance effect as a function of pressure in the normal state of the x = 0.02 sample also presented an evolution consistent with the screening of the Cu 2+ local moments. These findings demonstrate that the Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking effect is completely suppressed by applying pressure in the low concentration regime of Cu 2+ substituted BaFe 2 As 2."

In the latter case, the emergent SC state must be robust against the impurity pair-breaking mechanisms associated with strain/stress caused by the chemical substitution . In this regard, some substitutions, have revealed a strong pair-breaking mechanism. In fact, superconductivity does not emerge in Mn and Cr substituted BaFe 2 As 2 despite their effectiveness in suppressing the SDW order . Moreover, the inexpressive maximum T c ∼ 5 K observed in BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 within a narrow range of Cu 2+ concentrations contrasts with T c ∼ 26 K observed for Co-substituted samples .

This behavior happens at temperatures around 60-90 K and, in some cases, it might be associated with a vestige of the structural/SDW transitions. However, we are convinced that this is the case only for the x = 0.09 for which a corresponding anomaly was also found in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements (not shown). The samples with x = 0.10 and 0.11 show metallic-like behavior in the whole temperature range. The SC samples present the onset of T c varying from 2.5 to 4.2 K.

As such, one would expect a decreasing of T c as a function of pressure in the absence of any suppression of the pair-breaking mechanism only for concentrations equal or larger than the OPD limit. The magnetic field dependence of ρ ab (P , T ) for all studied single crystals around the OPD region is exemplified by the x = 0.11 sample in .

The values of T s and T SDW are in good agreement with the reported ones for BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 samples with the same Cu- concentration, measured by nuclear magnetic resonance and heat-capacity experiments . Upon increasing pressure, T s and T SDW are both suppressed but with different rates leading to an increase of the split between the transitions, as displayed in the T -P phase diagram shown in . A drop in the resistivity around 29 K (open symbols in ) starts to develop for P 2.8 GPa and evolves to a complete zero resistance state (ZRS) (solid symbols in figure 3(c) at P = 3.4 GPa. By increasing the pressure, the onset of T c ≈ 29 K remains nearly constant while the width of the SC transition becomes sharper. At P op ≈ 4.0 GPa a sharp SC transition is established with a T c ≈ 31 K. This value of T c is close to the maximum T c achieved in the pure BaFe 2 As 2 under pressure indicating that for this range of Cu- concentration and pressure, the Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking effect is completely suppressed by pressure. In fact, pressure is well known to lead to a screening of the local moments by enhancing their hybridization with the conduction electrons in many compounds . For pressures higher than P op ≈ 4.0 GPa, the onset of T c slowly decreases as a function of pressure and the ZRS disappears for P 8.4 GPa."
218,piva2015combined-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,11,"The small suppression of the SC transition temperature as a function of field up to 9 T, shown in , is again in agreement with the high critical fields of this family of compounds . The magnetic field dependence of ρ ab (P , T ) at 1.8 K for several pressures for x = 0.02 is presented in . Interestingly, the normal state resistivity for this compound shows a negative MR that evolves into a positive one for P > 2.4 GPa. A positive MR with a H 2 - dependence is usually expected in the Fermi-liquid regime of normal metals. The negative MR in metals usually indicates the presence of a spin-dependent scattering mechanism that can be suppressed by magnetic field. The results presented in figures 2(e) and 3(e) suggest the presence a spin-dependent scattering mechanism that tends to be reduced by increasing the Cu-concentration or pressure. As the SDW magnetic character of the Fe 3d electrons is nearly unaffected by the magnetic field (not shown), we attribute this spin-dependent scattering mechanism to the Cu 2+ (s = 1/2) local moments shown by recent ESR experiments, which directly probe the Cu oxidation state . The ESR data are in contrast to previous reports based on ARPES, XAS and NMR measurements, which suggest that the Cu atoms are in the Cu 1+ oxidation state . However, the data reported here is consistent with a Cu 2+ spin-dependent scattering mechanism. Such mechanism is responsible for the impurity magnetic pair-breaking effect which can be strongly suppressed by the application of pressure, leading to the significant enhancement of T c , as seen in . As such, it is expected that the suppression of the Cu 2+ spin dependent scattering mechanism by pressure would also lead to a negative MR in the normal state, as observed at low temperatures for the x = 0.02 sample in figure 3(e). Furthermore, the local moment character of Cu 2+ is supposed to decrease as a function of the Cu-concentration given that BaCu 2 As 2 is a Pauli paramagnet . This assumption is consistent with the fact that OPD samples show a positive MR in the normal state indicating a tendency to a more Fermi- liquid-like behavior. In fact, it has been recently suggested that the electronic character of the Cu and the strength of the As-As inter-layer bonds both strongly change between weakly Cu-substituted BaFe 2 As 2 and pure BaCu 2 As 2 , perhaps via a first-order lattice instability such as a miscibility gap in the BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 system ."

If this is true, it can well explain the behavior of T c tuned by pressure, as its anion height at ambient pressure is also larger than the optimized value of 1.38 Å. As for LiFeP, the anion height is 1.33, very close to the optimized value, but its T c is much lower. This is likely caused via the more extended electronic structure of phosphide over arsenide. LiFeP and LiFeAs have similar tendencies of T c tuned by pressure and their pressure coef- ficients are close. Additionally, T c and crystal lattice constants a and c for LiFeP at ambient pressure and LiFeAs at 5.5 ∼ 6.5 GPa become comparable . Therefore, we can view LiFeP as a compressed LiFeAs."

241,P065172501-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"Impurity substitution at the Cu site in high-T c cuprates has been considered to be a test probe for the mechanism of high-temperature superconductiv- ity and the symmetry of the superconducting order pa- rameter . It has also shed light on the recent striking issue of a normal-state pseudo-gap. The most important observation was that the non-magnetic Zn ion suppressed T c somewhat more than magnetic ions such as Ni for all kinds of hole-doped cuprates such as (La,Sr) 2 CuO 4 ,  YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ , ] YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 , and Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 . The T c reduction rate for Zn substitution was dT c /dx ∼ 10 K/% and was higher for underdoped compounds than opti- mally or overdoped ones. This behavior of T c is strongly contrasted with that of conventional superconductors, where the reduction of T c is stronger for magnetic ion impurities, but nearly absent for nonmagnetic ion impu- rities. This difference led to the theoretical formulation of an unconventional pairing mechanism and a symmetry of the order parameter for high-temperature superconduc- tor ."

Especially, one must be very cautious about the oxygen content when comparing the amounts of T c reduction di- rectly. Another complexity is due to the existence of several substitutable sites inside a unit-cell."

Without a charge reservoir block, it has only the back-bone structure common to all high-T c cuprates, CuO 2 planes separated only by a metallic spacer layer. The structure is robust, and oxygen is very stoichiometric and stable: buckling of the CuO 2 plane, O interstitials and O vacancies were re- ported to be nearly absent. The T c has been found to be very robust against modifications of the structure and changes in the magnetic moment due to doping various lanthanide ions at the Sr sites. Thus, the substitu- tion for Cu in the infinite-layer superconductors has the least possibility of changing T c via secondary routes, and observations should reveal a more intrinsic change in the T c of cuprate superconductors. However, difficulties in synthesizing high-quality sample has prohibited intense work on these infinite-layer superconductors. More- over, no work on the Cu-substitution effect has been reported."

For Ni substitution, both T c and the superconducting volume fraction drastically decrease, and superconductivity nearly vanishes for a 2% substitu- tion with an average T c reduction rate of dT c /dx ≥ 20 K/%. This behavior was confirmed for several samples with x = 0.02. However, for Zn substitution, the change in T c was less than about 2 K until x ∼ 0.03 where the superconducting volume fraction became less than about half that of the pristine sample. For samples with x > ∼ 0.03, growth of singl-phase samples was very diffi- cult.

The nearly total suppression of superconductivity in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 Cu 0.98 Ni 0.02 O 2 seems not to result from the lattice effect because the lattice constants remain much closer to those for superconducting Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 than those for insulating SrCuO 2 .

Our finding for (Sr 0.9 ,La 0.1 )CuO 2 seems to be the next step. Two kinds of representative n-type cuprates show similar behaviors for the substitution effect on T c , Ni killing the superconductivity faster than Zn. How- ever the difference is that the substitution effect in (Sr 0.9 ,La 0.1 )CuO 2 is much closer to those in conventional superconductors with respect to the exact value of the T c reduction rate dT c /dx. Impurity substitution effects in hole-doped cuprates and electron-doped cuprates have been discussed in terms of the superconducting gap symmetry, d-wave and s- wave, respectively . Phase-sensitive Josephson tunneling or the presence of a half flux quantum at the center of the tricrystal ring could be a direct test of d-wave superconductivity, but would require high-quality thin films, which have not been feasible for infinite-layer superconductors due to difficulties in film growth. In ad- dition, the pairing symmetry of the (Nd,Ce) 2 CuO 4 com- pound remains to be controversial. Many experimental observations indicate that (Sr 0.9 ,La 0.1 )CuO 2 has properties which are the most similar to those of conventional superconductors. This compound was reported to have more 3-dimensional su- perconductivity with the c-axis coherence length, even near zero temperature, being larger than the c-axis lat-tice constant. The undoped antiferromagnetic insu- lator Ca 0.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 2 has been reported to have more 3-dimensional magnetic coupling and that material has been reported to have a stronger 3-dimensional character than other parent insulators of cuprate superconductors, such as YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 , La 2 CuO 4 , and Sr 2 CuO 2 Cl 2 . For example, an estimate of the ratio of the out-of-plane to the in-plane coupling constants for Ca 0.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 2 was two to three orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding values for YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 and La 2 CuO 4 . A very recent observation of scanning tunneling spectra in (Sr 0.9 ,La 0.1 )CuO 2 support the existence of an s-wave gap with a superconducting gap ∆ ∼ 13 meV, as well as the absence of pseudogap. IV. SUMMARY We found that in electron-doped infinite-layer super- conductors Sr 0.9 La 0.1 Cu 1−x R x O 2 , substitution of the nonmagnetic Zn ion in the CuO 2 plane hardly suppress T c (dT c /dx ≤ 0.5 K/% for x ≤ 0.03) while substitution of the magnetic Ni ion kills the superconductivity at only x ∼ 0.02 (dT c /dx ≥ 20 K/%). This behavior is sim- ilar to that observed for conventional superconductors. This behavior is also consistent with many recent obser- vations, such as the existence of s-wave gap, the stronger 3-dimensionality in superconducting and antiferromag- netic properties."

Significant substitution on either the Mg or B sites has been achieved for only a few elements -for example, Al on the Mg site or C on the B site . Even for these elements achieving substitution is not simple. Al doping beyond 10% leads to phase separation , and phase transitions have been found at the 17 and 75% doping levels . Mg-Al ordering at 50% doping leads to a MgAlB 2 compound with a T c of 12K . Carbon substitution experiments have yielded conflicting results; from reports of no substitution , to phase separated samples , to limited solubility of about 15% with different T c behavior with composition. The solubility limits for most other elements have not yet been intensively investigated. The solubility limit (x in Mg 1-x M x B 2 ) has been reported for Li as 0.3 or 0.15 ; for Na as 0.2 , for Zn as 0.1 , for Mn as 0.03 and for Cu as 0 . There is no case where chemical substitution has increased T c above the value achieved for high-quality samples of pure MgB 2 (39 K)."
255,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,4,"Based on the literature for transition-metal diboride compounds, one might expect that changing the stoichiometry, for example, creating Mg vacancies, might be another way to alter the superconducting properties of MgB 2 . In 1970, Cooper et al. reported that they could raise the T c of NbB 2 to 3.87 K by synthesizing boron-rich compositions near NbB 2.5 . They also reported that boron-rich compositions gave the highest T c , above 11 K, in Zr 0.13 Mo 0.87 B 2+x . This is the highest T c reported for a transition-metal diboride. However they made no comment about how they thought the nonstoichiometric composition was accommodated. More recently, the (Zr,Mo)B 2+x system has been reinvestigated using neutron powder diffraction. It was shown that the nonstoichiometry is accommodated by the formation of vacancies on the Zr/Mo site and that vacancy concentrations up to 15% can be achieved."

Zhao et al. investigated Mg-deficient compositions and reported that lattice parameters and T c changed with starting composition. They explained their results as being due to either Mg vacancies or interstitial B atoms. However, they also observed MgB 4 as an impurity phase in their Mg-deficient samples, which argues against the formation of Mg vacancies. Gibb's phase rule (for a two-component system) is violated if a variable Mg vacancy content in MgB 2 and the expected impurity phase both appear under equilibrium conditions at constant T and P. Serquis et al. analyzed the Mg vacancy content and lattice strain in a series of MgB 2 samples using x-ray Rietveld analysis. They reported Mg vacancy concentrations up to 5% in their samples and concluded that T c scaled with both the Mg vacancy concentration and strain. Single crystal x-ray diffraction of samples grown under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions also showed a 4% Mg vacancy concentration. Margadonna et al. found large variations in the phase inhomogeneity in samples synthesized under high- pressure Ar. This variation was modeled with coexisting, Mg deficient, Mg 1-δ B 2 phases."
257,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,6,"A number of studies have invoked the existence of nonstoichiometry in MgB 2 as an explanation for differences among samples without providing experimental evidence that nonstoichiometry actually exists. For example, Chen et al. found a correlation between the residual resistance ratio and magnetoresistance for sample made at different starting compositions, from which they concluded that defect scattering, possibly disorder on the Mg site, was responsible for the sample to sample variation. Bordet et al. suggested that variations in Mg vacancy concentration could explain large differences reported for the pressure dependence of T c . A number of authors have speculated that Mg deficiency could explain the depressed T c 's observed in thin films. Conversely, other authors have concluded that accidental impurity doping was a more likely explanation for differences among samples. Recently, Ribeiro et al. investigated the effect of B purity on transport properties. They concluded that impurities in the B incorporated into the MgB 2 during synthesis can have a major effect on T c and on the residual resistivity ratio. They argue that impurities accidentally incorporated during synthesis, not nonstoichiometry, probably account for the differences in sample properties."

No variations were observed on traversing the phase boundary between B rich and Mg rich compositions that could be related to any change in stoichiometry of the MgB 2 phase. Although small changes in both lattice constants and T c 's were observed with composition, these changes result from strain and impurity effects, not from a variation in stoichiometry.

The amount of MgB 4 reaches a minimum at about 1 to 2 hours, than increases again. The amount never reaches zero as would be expected. Unreacted Mg was observed at the bottom of the crucible for all of the synthesized samples. Mg was also observed in the diffraction pattern of the synthesized samples for the 2 and 8hr reaction times showing that at longer times Mg was also present in the product as well as at the bottom of the crucible. The thermal gradients in the furnace are responsible for transporting the Mg from the initial position on the surface of the B powder to the coldest point at the bottom of the crucible. Some fraction of the Mg has probably transported to the bottom of the crucible before the temperature has increased to a point where reaction kinetics become rapid. Once the final temperature is reached, the reaction mixture is depleted in Mg since it is reacting faster than it can diffuse from the bottom of the crucible. At longer times Mg is again observed in the reaction mixture since the equilibrium vapor pressure of Mg is reached in the product."
267,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,16,"The reason the MgB 4 phase fraction never goes to zero could possibly be due to either 1), the slight loss of Mg due to volatility or its reaction with residual oxygen in the furnace or 2), the decomposition of MgB 2 due to the thermal gradients in the sample. The decomposition pressures for MgB 2 have been calculated by Liu et al. Using their result, a thermal gradient of about 400 o C would be required to have MgB 4 at the hotter sample top and Mg at the cooler crucible bottom. This thermal gradient is not possible, thus the increasing MgB 4 content is most likely due to the lower Mg vapor pressure at the top surface of the sample due to reaction with residual oxygen in the furnace or Mg volatility. This conclusion is supported by the observation of black MgB 4 present on the top surface of the reaction product after the 8hr reaction time."
268,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,17,"The overall composition of the sample is thus determined by two rate constants. There is a rapid synthesis step as the Mg reacts with the B that, from , would likely be completed in about 2hr under the conditions used for this work. There is also a slow decomposition step leading to MgB 4 that is determined by the rate of Mg loss from the top surface of the reaction mixture. This leads to a slightly nonuniform sample with Mg at the bottom of the crucible and MgB 4 at the top surface of the sample."

The T c was only significantly reduced for the sample with the longest reaction time showing the most MgB 4 .

This allows phase rules to be invoked in interpreting the data. A reaction time of two hours was used for the composition dependant studies. This is a compromise between a time long enough to completely react the sample and short enough to minimize the amount of MgB 4 . shows the refined amount of impurity (Mg or MgB 4 ) present in a series of MgB 2 samples as a function of Mg starting composition after a 2hr reaction time. No MgO was found in the diffraction analysis. This places an upper limit of about 2% on the amount of any oxygen contamination of the sample. Any Mg present at the bottom of the crucible was also transferred into the sample container for diffraction analysis. As expected, the dominate impurity in the Mg rich samples is Mg and in the Mg deficient samples is MgB 4 . However, for the reasons discussed above, there is no point around x=1 at which a single phase is found. The extrapolation of the Mg and MgB 4 concentrations to zero should show the single phase composition or single phase region of the phase diagram. The least squares fits of the impurity contents extrapolated to zero concentration give Mg 1.00 B 2 and Mg 1.01 B 2 for Mg deficient and Mg excess starting compositions, respectively. Based on only these data, the single phase composition could be on the slightly Mg rich side of the phase diagram or, conversely, a small region of variable nonstoichiometry could exist with up to 1% excess of Mg (or a deficiency of B). However, the errors in this analysis are on the order of a few %, thus, MgB 2 appears to be a stoichiometric compound from this chemical analysis of the reaction products."

The site occupancy is constant, within our experimental accuracy, over the entire phase range investigated. The refined value for the Mg site occupancy is not conclusive evidence that Mg vacancies actually exist. In the Rietveld refinement, Mg site deficiency could be mimicked by chemical substitution on either the Mg or B site (by elements with appropriately different scattering lengths) or by a failure of the Rietveld refinement code to correctly model the anharmonic thermal motion of the B atoms. The latter problem would be expected to yield artificially increased values for both the site occupancy and harmonic temperature factor of B, consistent with our observation of apparent Mg deficiency. Such systematic errors could explain the disagreement between the refined Mg-site occupancy ) and the slight Mg excess found in the chemical phase analysis for the single phase, or single phase region, of the phase diagram . However, the Mg excess required for the single phase composition found in the phase analysis can also be accounted for by a slight loss of Mg during the synthesis. This could occur due to volatilization and (or) reaction with oxygen (as was shown to occur in the time dependant investigation). Our overall conclusion is that a vacancy content of up to 1% at the Mg site cannot be ruled out. More importantly, the refined Mg site occupancy does not vary with starting composition; in particular there is no rapid change in site occupancy at or near x=1 that would indicate solid solution behavior over a small range of starting compositions. Thus, at this temperature, MgB 2 is a line compound. shows the lattice constants as a function of x for the various samples and shows the c/a ratio. The large scatter in the data points for the a-and c-axis lattice constants, much larger than the statistical errors of the profile fitting as measured by the size of the lattice points, is due to random instrumental errors, e.g. sample positioning. These errors are removed for lattice constant ratios, thus the c/a ratio show in has higher accuracy than the individual lattice constants. There is a rapid drop in c and c/a across the single phase region around x=1. The a-axis shows an almost linear dependence on Mg content. The c-axis changes by almost a factor of 3.5 more than the a-axis, thus the c/a ratio mimics the change in the c-axis. This rapid decrease in c/a at the nominal single phase composition could be interpreted as evidence for a Mg-vacancy solid solution region in the material, if one ignores the constant refined value for the Mg site occupancy. However, as will be shown, this anomaly in lattice constants is due to lattice strain, not any intrinsic stoichiometry variation in the MgB 2."
272,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,21,"The profile refinement of the diffraction peak shape for the samples did not show any evidence for particle size broadening, however, strain broadening was observed. The diffraction peak shapes were modeled in terms of an isotropic Gaussian strain broadening term (sig-1) plus an anisotropic strain broadening term (g1ec) that defines a small additional Lorentzian broadening along the c axis (These terms are defined in the GSAS manual.). shows both the isotropic stain parameter, sig-1, and the anisotropic strain parameter, g1ec, for the samples. The c/a ratio and the c-axis lattice constant scale with the much larger isotropic strain broadening (sig-1). The behavior of the lattice parameters and peak broadening versus starting composition can be readily understood by realizing that the behavior divides into three smoothly connected regimes; a Mg rich region, a nearly stoichiometric region and a MgB 4 rich region."
273,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,22,"In the Mg rich region, above Mg 1.1 B 2 , the strain, both isotropic and anisotropic, is lowest and the lattice parameters display their intrinsic values. In this region, where a significant amount of Mg metal is present as an impurity phase, grain-interaction stresses among the randomly oriented MgB 2 crystallites are relieved. Our hypothesis is that some of the Mg metal is distributed on the grain boundaries that separate individual crystallites, allowing stress relaxation on these boundaries. We note a report of Mg in grain boundaries of sintered MgB 2 samples observed by analytical electron microscopy, consistent with this hypothesis. In the intermediate regime, from Mg 0.9 B 2 to Mg 1.1 B 2 , the amount of impurity phase, whether Mg metal or MgB 4 , is small enough that the behavior is dominated by grain interaction stresses among the randomly oriented MgB 2 crystallites. Because of these stresses, upon cooling from the synthesis temperature, the MgB 2 crystallites are inhibited from realizing the full anisotropy of the intrinsic thermal expansion, which is twice as large along the c axis than along the a axis . Instead, the c-axis thermal expansion is slightly reduced and the a-axis thermal expansion is slightly increased. This yields a slightly larger c axis and slightly smaller a axis, when compared to the strain-free values observed in the strain-free Mg-rich regime."
274,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,23,"In the composition region below Mg 0.9 B 2 , where the concentration of MgB 4 as an impurity phase is high, the material displays the behavior of an MgB 2 / MgB 4 composite in which the response of MgB 2 lattice and peak broadening parameters depends on the thermal expansion behavior of both components of the composite."
275,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,24,"We, thus, conclude that the observed small variations in lattice parameters over the range of starting compositions studied results from the multiphase behavior of the samples and the resulting effects on grain interaction stresses, not on any variation of the stoichiometry of the MgB 2 phase."

The transition temperatures remain relatively constant in the Mg deficient region of the phase diagram but decrease systematically in the Mg rich region.

In the transition temperatures are plotted versus the calculated phase fraction of MgB 2 based on a stoichiometric x=1 phase composition in order to more clearly show the difference between the Mg deficient and Mg rich regions. For the Mg-deficient samples with MgB 4 as the second phase, T c is essentially constant. The line through these data in is a least squares fit which is nearly horizontal indicating no variation of T c with phase fraction. In the Mg-rich region of the phase diagram, T c decreases continuously with decreasing MgB 2 phase fraction. This behavior can't be explained by any variation in the intrinsic nonstoichiometry of the MgB 2 phase. Additionally, there is no correlation between lattice strain and T c ; indeed, the Mg-rich region that shows a small, constant lattice strain has the largest change in T c . One must conclude that T c is independent of strain."
277,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,26,A simple explanation for the observed T c dependence of the Mg content of the sample is that an impurity (or impurities) in the Mg incorporate into the MgB 2 phase and lower its transition temperature. shows a hypothetical phase diagram that could account for the observed T c behavior.

In this region, the impurity content of the MgB 2 will increase linearly with Mg content and, assuming a linear dependence of T c with x, will lead to a linear suppression of T c as is observed. Note that if the impurity responsible for the T c suppression was coming from the B, T c would remain constant in this region."

Thus the T c maximum should occur in this two-phase, Mg deficient region. Although the errors in the T c determination are large, the data in might suggest that the maximum T c does indeed occur at x < 1."
280,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,29,"In the MgB 2 + MgB 4 (SS) region of the phase diagram T c should remain constant since the impurity content would remain at zero and all of the impurity would be incorporated into the MgB 4 phase. This is consistent with the data in , which show a constant T c within the accuracy of the measurement. The T c behavior would be quite different if B had been the host for the impurity. T c would be high and constant in the MgB 2 + MgB 4 (SS) phase region and show a decrease in the MgB 2 (SS) + MgB 4 (SL) phase region analogous to the case for Mg hosting the impurity. However, in the Mg + MgB 2 (SS) phase region T c would remain constant and suppressed. Thus, in our case the dominant effect on T c is due to impurity contamination from the starting Mg."
281,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,30,"The actual behavior of T c will depend on the impurities present, their distribution in the starting materials, and the nature of the Mg-B-Im phase diagram for each particular impurity. This could lead to very complex behavior of T c with starting composition depending on the number of impurities, their effect on T c and their interaction with the relevant boride phases. In our case, the impurity content was low, and we could model the T c in a very simple way."

The impurity calculations were done if both starting elements had analyzed impurity concentrations or if the impurity was dominant in only one starting element and we could assume zero concentration in the second element. The impurity elements group into 3 classes. The first class (Si, Fe) have large, random variations from the expected values. These elements most likely have large nonuniform distributions in the solid phase due to small diffusion constants at the low synthesis temperature. The second group of elements (Ca, Mn, In) have values larger than expected. These elements have most likely been additionally doped into the material from external sources during the synthesis and handling procedures. The last group (Zn, Pb, Al) on the other hand, have concentrations that scale in a manner consistent with the T c behavior, i.e. increasing impurity content as the Mg starting composition increases. Zn and Pb actually follow the calculated impurity content fairly closely. These elements, being volatile, attain a uniform distribution in the solid phase, however, may not actually have been incorporated into lattice. None of these elements is likely responsible for the T c variation in the samples, the concentration is far too low. Al, for example, would require almost 6000 ug/g for a 0.2K drop in T c based on the work reported in Ref. . Even though it may be impossible to identify the impurity responsible for the T c variation, the analysis shows that some dopants do follow the correct phase behavior."
285,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,34,"In conclusion, we have shown that, for the synthesis conditions employed in this work (850°C in 50 atm. Ar gas), MgB 2 is a line compound; i.e., it does not have variable composition. The composition may be slightly (up to 1%) Mg deficient; however, other effects such as a failure of the Rietveld refinement to adequately model the anharmonic motion of B or chemical substitution on either the Mg or B site can mimic Mg vacancies in structure refinements. In this regard, we note that chemical substitution may provide an alternative explanation for the 4% Mg vacancy concentration observed in single- crystal x-ray diffraction studies of MgB 2 crystals grown at high pressure from the Mg-B-N system. In particular, incorporation of N at the B site would raise the x-ray scattering cross section of that site, leading to an indication of Mg deficiency in a refinement that assumed only B on the B site. A more precise determination of the composition may be possible by exploiting the different scattering contrasts in a joint neutron and x-ray diffraction study or by pyctnometric measurements of the density of single crystals. However, achieving better accuracy than the present study will be difficult."
286,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,35,"Although these results apply only to MgB 2 made under these synthesis conditions, they are likely to hold for other synthesis methods near the same range of temperature and pressure. Moreover, this study illustrates the approach that must be taken to explore whether variable composition can be achieved by other synthesis methods. First, the synthesis technique must adequately approximate equilibrium conditions. Second, all products of the synthesis must be accounted for in the analysis. Phase rules can only be applied if these two conditions are satisfied."
287,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,36,"We have also shown that small variation of lattice parameters with starting composition is not an adequate proof of variable composition in the MgB 2 phase. In the present study, small variations arise from grain-interaction stresses, which vary with the phase composition of the sample, leading to a rather complex behavior of the lattice parameters with starting composition. We note that stress effects could be greatly amplified in samples made at high pressure because stresses introduced under high-pressure synthesis conditions, where strong sintering between grains occurs, may not be able to relax."
288,P063224522-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,37,A small variation of T c with starting composition observed in the Mg-rich regime in our study can be explained in terms of accidental doping by an impurity in the starting Mg.

For example, Ribeiro et al. reported rather large changes in T c depending on the purity of the starting B.[21] However, in both their study and ours, it has not been possible to identify the impurity or to quantify its concentration in the MgB 2 . A detailed interpretation of accidental impurity doping effects requires a knowledge of the ternary phase diagram for Mg, B, and that particular impurity. We have shown in the present case that it is possible to hypothesize a phase diagram that is consistent with all experimental observations. It may be possible to extend the concept of accidental impurity doping to develop methods for achieving deliberate chemical substitution in MgB 2 . For example, alloys of Mg might be used to incorporate other metals on the Mg site. It has already been shown that BC can be used as a starting material to synthesize C-doped MgB 2-x C x .  Creative use of such ideas may provide a route for exploring chemically substituted MgB 2 in cases where other synthesis routes have failed."

Quantitative carbon analysis revealed that carbon could be introduced into Y-123 from both the precursor and the sintering gas. Nearly carbon-free (< 200 ppm) samples were prepared from a vacuum-treated precursor by sintered at 900 ˚C and cooling with 20 ˚C /min in flowing oxygen gas. The lower T c (= 88 K) and higher oxygen content (y = 6.98) strongly suggested the overdoping state, which was supported by the temperature dependence of resisitivity and thermoelectric power. The nuclear quadrapole resonance spectra and the Raman scattering spectra indicated that there was almost no oxygen defect in the Cu-O chain in these samples. On the other hand, in the same cooling condition, the samples sintered in air stayed at optimal doping level with T c = 93 K, and the intentionally carbon-doped sample was in the underdoping state. It is revealed that about 60% of incorporated carbon was substituted for Cu at the chain site in the form of CO 3 2+ , and the rest remains at the grain boundary as carbonate impurities. Such incorporation affected the oxygen absorption process in Y-123. It turned out that the oxygen content in Y-123 cannot be controlled only by the annealing temperature and the oxygen partial pressure but also by the incorporated carbon concentration."

Although fully oxygenated Y-123 with y > 6.99 must be overdoped with T c = 87-89 K , the T c of well-oxygenated polycrystal is saturated at about (=92-93 K ).

As rising the quenching temperature, T c increased and had a maximum at 93.5 K in the sample quenched from 460 ˚C , and further rising temperature led to a decrease in T c. These results proved that Sample B1 was in the overdoped state without any post-annealing."
323,PHC4210001-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,25,"So far it has been believed that long time and low temperature annealing in oxygen were needed to obtain an overdoped sample.

This will be discussed in section 3.3"

T c of B1 is lower than those of B3 and A1. The r-T curve of B1 keeps a good linearity down to T c , while those of B3 and A1 slightly drop from 30-50 K above T c, which is consistent with the results of single crystals . Though the absolute values of resistivity are considerably higher than those of single crystal, we supposed that it is an effect of grain boundaries."

The S-T curve with the room temperature value of S = -3mV/K for B1 shows a good agreement with that of overdoped single crystal (T c = 87 K, y = 6.99) as well as the absolute value at room temperature . The S-T curves for the optimally doped samples (B3 and A1) are also the same as those of nearly optimally doped single crystal ."

Very sharp peaks in the spectrum for B1 indicate no appreciable oxygen deficiency, while broad and tailed peaks in B3 suggest charge distribution due to oxygen deficienciy . The spectrum of A1 was almost the same as that of B3. The 63 Cu nuclear spin-lattice relaxation curves also confirmed that the sample B1 has a stoichiometric composition in oxygen, but A1 and B3 have some defects."

The peak near 500 cm -1 is ascribed to stretching mode phonon for the apical oxygen, while the peak at about 580 cm -1 corresponds to the same mode but for the chain oxygen deficient sites. As the oxygen content increases, the 500 cm -1 peak shifts to higher wave number which indicates shortening of the bond distance between Cu(2) and the apical oxygen. Simultaneously, the defect-induced mode at about 580 cm -1 vanishes."

The T c of C1 was 3.5 K higher than that of B1(See and ), and the residual carbon concentration of C1 is much higher than that of B1. This demonstrates that one of the carbon impurity sources is residual carbon in the precursor. It was supported by the direct carbon analysis for the precursor. The carbon concentration of the air-heated precursor (2031 ppm) was five times larger than that of vacuum-heated precursor (413 ppm)."

They also indicated that the total carbon concentration in the sample is higher than the substituted carbon, which means there are additional impurities at the grain boundaries and/or the grain surface of Y-123. Assuming a linear relationship between the substituted carbon concentration and the reduction in c, we estimated the former from the latter data in our samples, as illustrated in and in . This estimation suggests that about 1% of Cu(1) was replaced with CO 3 2+ in the case of conventionally synthesized Y-123."

The Seebeck coefficient of Sample D2 is comparable to that of the 600˚C-quenched sample (B5).

The answer of these questions is that a polycrystalline sample of Y-123 prepared in a conventional way contains a small amount of carbon, which makes its carrier doping level optimum in spite of the oxygen annealing that should give an overdoped state. We also demonstrated that carbon came from both the precursor and the sintering gas."

Furthermore, the amount of substituted carbon in Cu was estimated from the shrinking of lattice parameter c. According to our analyses, the conventionally prepared Y-123 has about 1% carbon-substitution at the Cu chain site and oxygen cannot be fully introduced, resulting in the optimally doping state. These results require us to reexamine the complex and partly contradictory results reported for slightly overdoed polycrystals."

358,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,1,"We report the results from a thermopower and a Cu nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the infinite CuO 2 layer electron doped high temperature superconducting cuprate (HTSC), Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 . We find that the temperature dependence of the thermopower, S(T), is different from that observed in the hole doped HTSC. In particular, we find that dS(T)/dT is positive above ~120 K. However, we show that S(T) can still be described by the same model developed for the hole doped HTSC and hence S(T) is not anomalous and does not imply phonon mediated pairing as has previously been suggested. The Cu NMR data reveal a Knight shift and spin lattice relaxation rate below T c that are inconsistent with isotropic s-wave pairing. The Cu spin lattice relaxation rate in the normal state, however, is Curie-Weiss like and is comparable to that of the optimally and overdoped hole doped HTSC, La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 . The magnitude of the Knight shift indicates that the density of states at the Fermi level is anomalously small when compared with the hole doped HTSC with the same T c , indicating that the size of ) ( f E N is of little importance in the HTSC. We find no evidence of the normal state pseudogap that is observed in the hole doped HTSC and which was recently reported to exist in the electron doped HTSC, Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 4 , from infrared reflectance measurements."
359,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"Introduction One of the major difficulties in developing a consistent theoretical model of superconductivity in the high temperature superconducting cuprates (HTSC) is understanding the magnetic and electronic behavior of the hole doped and electron doped HTSC. It is now generally agreed that the hole doped HTSC (HDHTSC) have a d-wave superconducting order parameter, show a normal state pseudogap for low hole doping and exhibit a non-Korringa relationship between the Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate and the Cu Knight shift. This non-Korringa behavior has been attributed to the Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate being dominated by coupling to antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The situation in the electron- doped HTSC (EDHTSC), based on R 2-x Ce x CuO 4 (R is a rare earth), is not so clear. There are conflicting reports concerning the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that a pseudogap exists when superconductivity is suppressed by high magnetic fields but only for temperatures less than ~25 K or there exists a pseudogap in the normal state for temperatures up to 300 K. The understanding of the spin dynamics is hampered by the magnetic rare earth atom, which is believed to dominate the spin-lattice relaxation. It is known that the nuclear quadrupole frequency is anonymously small when compared to that of the HDHTSC, which is not understood."
360,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,3,"Previous reports of NMR measurements on the infinite layer EDHTSC, Sr 1-x La x CuO 2, have shown that the Cu spin lattice relaxation rate in the normal state increases with decreasing temperature, although the absolute values of the Cu spin lattice relaxation rate are different in these studies. This compound has the advantage that it does not contain magnetic rare earth ions that can affect the NMR data. Furthermore, the superconducting transition temperature, T c , is much higher (~40 K ) than that in the other EDHTSC, R 2-x Ce x CuO 4 , where superconductivity exists for lower temperatures of <25 K and the occurrence of superconductivity and the Meissner fraction depends upon aggressive annealing at high temperatures in a reducing atmosphere. The one disadvantage of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is that it must be made using a high pressure synthesis technique and incorrect synthesis can lead to site disorder, the partial formation of the 1D antiferromagnetic insulator, SrCuO 2 , as well as the antiferromagnetic insulator, La 2 CuO 4 ."
361,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,4,"Interest in the infinite layer compound has recently been revived by a report that the carrier concentration of CaCuO 2 can be altered by field effect doping resulting in hole doped or electron doped superconductors . It is therefore important to compare the normal and superconducting state properties of the infinite layer superconductors with those from the HDHTSC. For example, tunneling spectra, and the rate at which T c is suppressed by Zn and Ni, have been interpreted in terms of a s-wave superconducting order parameter , which would appear to suggest a different superconducting pairing mechanism when compared with the HDHTSC. Furthermore, a thermopower study has concluded that the superconducting pairing mechanism is phonon mediated ."

The dc magnetization measurements were made using a SQUID magnetometer, where the remnant field was ±0.1 mT. The data were not corrected for demagnetizing effects.

364,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,7,"Cu NMR measurements were made on both unorientated powder and c-axis aligned powder samples in resin. Powder spectra were obtained at fields of 5.6 T, 8.45 T, and 14.1 T, point-by-point using the π/2-τ-π-τ Hahn pulse sequence, where π/2 was between 2 µs and 10 µs and τ was between 30 µs and 40 µs. The second half of the echo was Fourier transformed and then integrated, or summed, to obtain the intensity at each frequency. As the probes used to obtain the spectra had a Cu background, data was not taken near this frequency."

The 63 Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate, T 1 -1 , was obtained using both the inversion recovery technique and from the magnetization recovery after the application a saturating comb of π/2 pulses. In both cases the magnetization recovery for the I=3/2 Cu nuclei for magnetic relaxation (∆m=±1) is , where τ denotes the time between the inversion pulse or the last saturation pulse, Γ is 2 for perfect inversion and 1 for the application of a perfect π/2 saturating comb."
366,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,9,It was found that the second scenario better fitted the data. The excitation of the +1/2↔+3/2 and -1/2↔-3/2 transitions result in different A and C values and a nonzero B value.

It becomes finite and negative at the transition temperature of 44 K determined from susceptibility measurements (see figure 1 inset). The thermopower continues to become more negative until reaching a maximum negative value near 110 K and then falls toward zero."
368,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,11,"It is interesting to compare this behavior to that in the HDHTSC, in which a very general trend has emerged. In those materials the thermopower just above the superconducting transition temperature falls with a nearly constant (and approximately universal) slope ."
369,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,12,"The magnitude near the superconducting transition temperature depends on the doping level, which has led to its use as a gauge of the hole concentration . The only superconducting cuprates to deviate from this general behaviour are those with conducting chains and/or ribbons, which are thought to make their own positive slope contribution to the thermopower . An interpretation of this generic behaviour is available based on the doping dependence of the Fermi surface, and a conventional treatment of the charge carrying quasiparticles ."
370,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,13,"Within this picture the thermopower is comprised of a diffusion contribution, linear in temperature with a sign and magnitude that is determined by the Mott formula, and a phonon drag contribution, S g , which is given by, Here a C is the volumetric heat capacity of the acoustic phonons, N is the concentration of carriers, e is the electronic charge, p W is the scattering rate for phonons and pe W is the contribution from events in which the phonons are scattered by electrons. The sign and magnitude of the constant A is determined by a balance of scattering events in which the electron traverses filled vs. empty states in reciprocal space."
371,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,14,"The generic behavior of the thermopowers in the HDHTSC then fits within this picture as being a contribution of a diffusion term and the temperature independent phonon drag contribution imposed by the heat capacity at temperatures above the acoustic phonon maximum. This interpretation implies that there is no temperature dependence in the ratio , consistent with a picture in which the temperature dependent anharmonic phonon scattering does not significantly limit the phonon lifetime. Similar behavior is occasionally found also in conventional metals , although it is more common to find that the phonon drag contribution falls as 1/T above the Debye temperature, where anharmonic scattering limits the phonon lifetime . Thus, in conventional metals one usually finds a low temperature thermopower showing a linear temperature diffusion component and a cubic temperature phonon drag component, while at higher temperatures the drag contribution is inversely dependent on the temperature. It can be seen in that the thermopower in the present case conforms to the more common behavior, for low temperatures, and, for high temperatures. The linear diffusion term coefficient, 1 a , and the low and high temperature phonon drag coefficients, 2 a and 3 a , are fitted as"
372,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,15,"The magnitudes found for the various contributions are entirely reasonable when compared to either theoretical expectations or to data on the HDHTSC or conventional metals . The high temperature 1/T attenuation of S g caused by the ratio p pe W W / is however weak, suggesting that even here the phonon lifetime is limited more strongly by electrons than by anharmonicity. There is no evidence of any deviation from the expected behavior that might suggest the development of a pseudogap."
373,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,16,"Finally, we note that there is an earlier report of thermopower measurements on thin films of the EDHTSC, Sr 0.9 Nd 0.1 CuO 2 , where T c varied from 24 K to non-superconducting . In that report the thermopower data were also fitted to a sum of linear temperature and inverse temperature terms, though the temperature range chosen (<90 K) was inappropriate for assigning the inverse-temperature behavior to a phonon drag contribution. Consequently, the conclusion that the low temperature thermopower data (<90 K) from the thin film samples implies phonon mediated pairing in the EDHTSC is also inappropriate."
374,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,17,"We now consider the Cu NMR data. We show in figure 2 that the room temperature Cu NMR powder spectra are narrow and nearly independent of applied magnetic field when scaled by the Larmor frequency. The resonance from the 65 Cu isotope occurs at a higher frequency and is not shown. The 63 Cu NMR spectrum at 14.1 T contains a narrow region of 1.4 MHz in extent and a broad weaker region extending to ±6 MHz. It is clear that the broadening of the central peak is little affected by second order nuclear quadrupole broadening in contrast to the HDHTSC. This is evident in where the 63 Cu NMR spectra taken at 8.45 T (filled circles) and 5.6 T (open circles), scaled by the applied field, are also shown. It can be seen that that the widths are nearly the same, indicating that second order nuclear quadrupole effects are small. The weaker broad signal is likely to be due to the +1/2↔+3/2 and -1/2↔-3/2 satellite transitions and a distribution of nuclear quadrupole frequencies. We estimate, from the NMR spectra at different magnetic fields, that the average nuclear quadrupole frequency is less than 3 MHz. This is significantly smaller than that observed in the HDHTSC (16 MHz to 40 MHz ). However it is comparable to the upper estimate of the nuclear quadrupole frequency in superconducting samples of the EDHTSC, Nd 2-x Ce x CuO 4 (< 2 MHz ), and it is consistent with the estimates from two previous studies on Sr 1-x La x CuO 2 with x>=0.07 (<~3 MHz )."
375,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,18,"We show in that the 63 Cu NMR spectrum from a c-axis aligned sample at 9 T with c⊥B shifts to lower frequency for temperatures below T c and there is a significant increase in the linewidth as can be seen in the insert to figure 3. An increase in the 63 Cu NMR linewidth is also observed in the HDHTSC and it has been associated with vortices in a type II superconductor and the formation of a flux lattice at low temperatures . The corresponding 63 Cu NMR shift, δ ab , is plotted in , where it can be seen that δ ab is temperature independent in the normal state as reported by Mikhalev et al. from measurements on an unaligned powder sample. Imai et al. also noted that the δ ab was temperature independent but the shift data were not presented. The 63 Cu NMR shift can be understood by noting that, for axial symmetry, the total NMR shift, δ α , of the central transition in an external field B directed in the α-direction with respect to the crystal frame shift can be written as, , where, α is ab for c||B or c for c⊥B, α ν ∆ is the shift in frequency from the Larmor frequency, 0 ν , ) ( , T K s α is the temperature dependent Knight shift, α , 63 orb K is the temperature independent orbital shift, α , dia K is the diamagnetic shift due to the superconducting screening currents and (2 ) , 0 / Q α ν ν ∆ is the second order nuclear quadrupole shift. The diamagnetic shift decreases with increasing magnetic field due to increased flux penetration. We estimate this shift in a manner similar to Zheng et al. [38], where the previous estimate was made for the HDHTSC, YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8, and found to be close to the experimental value. Using the experimentally determined values of the penetration depth and the superconducting coherence length [21], we find that % 007 . 0 , − ≈ ⊥ dia K at 9 T and for low temperatures where the flux solid occurs."
376,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,19,"The second order quadrupole term in equation is large in the HDHTSC because of the large electric field gradient at the Cu nucleus and it can be the dominant term, leading to a NMR shift of up to 3.5 % for c⊥B. The subtraction of the large second order quadrupole, and the small diamagnetic term, at low temperatures leads to the orbital shift which, for the HDHTSC, is ~0.22 % in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 , ~0.22 % in Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ , and ~0.30 % in La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 . These values are very similar to the low temperature NMR shift from our Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 sample which, after correction from the small diamagnetic shift, is 0.21 % for c⊥B.

In the heavily overdoped region, ) ( 63 T K s increases with decreasing temperature in the normal state, which may be due to the proximity to a van Hove singularity. A varying density of states (DOS) within ~T k B 2 of the Fermi level, f E , affects the Knight shift because the Knight shift is proportional to the static spin susceptibility, which can be expressed as, ε s N is the DOS and ) (ε f is the Fermi function. Consequently, the absence of a decrease in ) ( , 63 T K s ⊥ with decreasing temperature indicates that there is no significant normal state pseudogap in the EDHTSC, Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 . Rather, the Fermi surface is flat at least for energies within ~T k B 2 of the Fermi energy. The Knight shift above 50 K is estimated from figure 4, and by accounting for the small diamagnetic correction, to be 0.09 %. This is significantly less than that observed in optimally doped HDHTSC.

Using the Knight shift and the known HDHTSC Cu hyperfine coupling constants, we estimate that the static spin susceptibility in the normal state for Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is 5 10 2 . 1 − × . This is slightly less than the measured susceptibility in our sample of 5 10 6 . 1 − × , indicating that the smaller Knight shift can not be accounted for by a large reduction in the hyperfine coupling constants.

This, along with the flat Fermi surface within ~T k B 2 of the Fermi energy, implies that models developed to account for superconductivity that are based on differences in the band structure (e.g. von Hove singularity, 2 band models etc.) do not appear to be relevant to the HTSC. The significantly smaller ) ( f E N found in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 when compared with the HDHTSC is likely to be due to the different band structures. It can be seen in the insert to figure 4 that the Knight shift decreases for temperatures below T c due to the decreased DOS near f E in the superconducting state. However, the Knight shift can not be fitted by assuming either a s-wave superconducting order parameter (dotted curve) or a d-wave superconducting order parameter (dashed curve) using the experimentally observed c B T k / 2∆=7 ."

A similar problem exists with the HDHTSC where the Knight shift can be nearly temperature independent for low temperatures although it should be linearly dependent on temperature due to the d-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. It has been suggested that the nearly temperature independent Knight shift observed in some of the HDHTSC for T<<T c is due to a finite DOS at the Fermi level . We show by the solid curve in the insert to figure 4, the theoretical δ ab obtained by assuming a d-wave superconducting order parameter and a similar residual DOS with 25 , where 0 N is the DOS in the normal state.

380,P065224520-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,23,"In conclusion, we find that the temperature dependence of the normal-state thermopower from the infinite layer EDHTSC, Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 , is different from that observed in the other HTSC. In particular, dS(T)/dT is positive for temperatures above 120 K, which is not observed in HDHTSC that only contain CuO 2 planes. However, S(T) can be fitted to the thermopower model developed for the HDHTSC where the thermopower is modeled in terms of a diffusion term and a phonon drag term. Consequently, a previous interpretation of the thermopower data from Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 thin films in terms of phonon mediated pairing is inappropriate. The 63 Cu Knight shift from the EDHTSC, Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is much smaller than from the HDHTSC with the same T c, which we interpret in terms of a much smaller DOS at the Fermi level. Furthermore, the 63 Cu Knight shift is temperature independent in the normal state indicating a flat DOS at least for energies ~T k B 1 63 / 1 T decrease more slowly than expected for an isotropic s-wave superconductor. We show that this can be interpreted in terms of a d-wave superconducting order parameter, a residual DOS and additional relaxation by fluxoids. Thus, the significantly smaller DOS, the flat DOS within T k B 2 of the Fermi level, but comparable dynamical spin susceptibility and symmetry of the superconducting order parameter would appear to suggest that the pairing mechanism is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations as suggested by some of the models of the HDHTSC."

The anoma- lous positive curvature, d 2 H ρ /dT 2 > 0, is the strongest in materials with the largest normal state anisotropy, regardless of whether anisotropy is varied by changing the carrier concentration or by comparing a variety of optimally-doped compounds."
387,PR06012475-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"The anisotropy of the high T c cuprates, coupled with their short coherence lengths, gives rise to a complex magnetic phase diagram, featuring a vortex liquid state located between the vortex solid and the normal state . In particular, in the high T c cuprates, the vortex lattice can melt at temperatures well below the onset of short-range superconducting order occurring at the up- per critical magnetic field H c2 . In a fixed temperature experiment, this is evidenced by the onset of resistiv- ity due to vortex motion well below the magnetic field at which the normal-state resistivity is restored, defined as the resistively-determined upper critical magnetic field, H ρ c2 (T ). Resistivity measurements on overdoped Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO y (Tl-2201) and overdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO y (Bi-2201) have found a strong upward curvature in H ρ c2 (T ) with no evidence of saturation at low temper- atures. Such an H ρ c2 (T ) curve contrasts strongly with the conventional Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory for superconductors with weak electron-phonon coupling , in which H c2 (T ) exhibits negative curvature and saturates at low temperatures. Similarly anoma- lous H ρ c2 (T ) curves have been discussed in connection with other anisotropic superconductors, such as the or- ganic superconductors . However, due to the extremely large upper critical fields, studies of the resistive transi- tion in the cuprates have been largely limited to samples in which T c and H c2 are greatly suppressed , either in strongly underdoped or overdoped samples , in deliberately impurity-doped samples , or in the electron-doped cuprates."

At this mean-field H c2 (T ), no feature is observed in the measured resistivity. Perhaps more surprisingly, the experimental evidence for this mean- field H c2 (T ), in both the specific heat and Raman ex- periments, is anomalously and dramatically suppressed by magnetic fields of only a few tesla. Thus, H ρ c2 (T ) does not seem to correspond to the mean-field H c2 (T ), which might suggest that it corresponds to the melting of the vortex lattice. The difficulty with this interpreta- tion of H ρ c2 (T ) is that it is unclear why the melted vortex state should be (or can be) indistinguishable in resistivity measurements from the normal state. More specifically, if H ρ c2 (T ) corresponds to the irreversibility line, then the magnetic phase diagram (at least for Tl-2201 and Bi- 2201) contains an unusual vortex liquid state whose resis- tivity apparently equals the normal-state resistivity and exhibits no substantial magnetic-field or temperature de- pendence . In light of the debate about the magnetic phase diagram and the interpretation of H ρ c2 (T ) in the cuprates, a systematic study of H ρ c2 (T ), particularly in optimally-doped compounds, is clearly desirable."

The resis- tivity of each sample was measured at a given fixed tem- perature during the magnetic field pulse using a ∼100 kHz lockin technique . No significant eddy current heating resulted from the time-varying magnetic field.

This definition is our best determination of the irreversibility line, given the limited sensitivity of the pulsed-field data.

In traditional superconductors, H50 is often asso- ciated with the mean-field upper critical field H c2 ; how- ever, given the uncertain interpretation of the resistive transition in the cuprates, we make no a priori determi- nation of H ρ c2 (T ) from the data.

This fact precludes the usage of the usual criteria for the irreversibility field defined by a cer- tain electric-field threshold. This is the reason why we needed to determine the onset field H onset rather naively with the magnetic field at which the resistivity first is detected to deviate from zero in the ρ vs H plot."

One can infer from Fig. that R n of Bi-2212 and LSCO (x=0.17) be- comes relatively temperature independent at low temper- atures and therefore the errors involved in the estimation of R n are relatively small compared to that for YBCO. The data in Fig. show large positive ""magnetoresis- tance"", particularly at lower temperatures, which makes the definition of R n rather ambiguous. As a result, the estimated errors for H10 etc. are comparatively large for YBCO.

The superconducting properties of the sample were determined by resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements. The re- sistive transition (midpoint) and the onset of diamag- netic shielding occurs at T onset c =13.5(1) K (see ). The width of the resistive transition (10%-90% criterion) amounts to 0.1 K. The heat capacity proves bulk su- perconductivity with a characteristic anomaly at T c of ∆C p /(γT c ) ≈ 2.2; the deviation from the standard BCS anomaly is most likely due to enhanced electron-phonon coupling."

The bulk modulus of La 2 C 3 at 30 GPa is about 250 GPa. This value would be an upper limit for the ambient-pressure bulk modulus B 0 of Y 2 C 3 ; it is much lower than the calculated one (B 0 = 363 GPa) reported in Ref. .

The arrangement of metal ions in La 2 C 3 is similar to that of the 'cI16' (16-atom body centered cubic) phase of high-pressure Li which can be interpreted as a 2×2×2 su- perstructure of bcc. In Li-cI16 a pseudo-gap is formed, involving a lowering of the density of states N (E F ) at the Fermi level, which leads to a decrease of the total energy relative to any of the common high-symmetry phases of elemental metals. Despite the pseudo-gap formation, the cI16 phase of Li is a superconductor with T c > 10 K (see Ref. and literature cited therein). As for La 2 C 3 , the Fermi level is calculated to also fall into a local mini- mum of the DOS. This is qualitatively similar to what is reported for Y 2 C 3 . 4,5 It is not clear whether the forma- tion of a local DOS minimum in the sesquicarbides is a consequence of the structural distortion of the metal sub- lattice away from bcc. In any case, the states in the DOS minimum of Y 2 C 3 show a strong coupling to 'symmetry- preserving' metal atom displacements, i.e. a change in the x parameter. For La 2 C 3 , a C-C distance of 1.236Å is given in Ref. . A slightly larger distance, about 1.29Å (Ref. 8), appears more plausible.

Despite the larger carbon to metal ratio, the bulk modulus of LaC 2 comes out slightly lower compared to La 2 C 3 . This may be explained by the larger metal-metal distance in LaC 2 (12 × 3.93Å at ambient pressure) compared to the average value for La 2 C 3 (3 × 3.63Å, 2 × 3.81Å, 6 × 4.01Å).

Thus, all the above results of the low-temperature MR and R H seem to be most consistent with the Kondo ef- fect, which may be caused by the local moments 7 induced by the Zn impurities. The possibility that the Kondo effect is playing a major role in the Zn-doped sam- ples also explains the various differences between the nor- mal state in the Zn-doped samples and that in pristine samples under high magnetic fields. For more quanti- tative understanding of the possible Kondo effect in the cuprates, theoretical calculations for the Kondo scatter- ing in the non-Fermi-liquid ground state of the cuprates would be required."

Comparison of the low-temperature normal state brought about by Zn-doping to that brought about by high magnetic field reveals significant difference between the two, which highlights the peculiar nature of the charge- localized state in the Zn-doped samples. The negative MR and the upturn in R H observed at low temperatures strongly suggest that the Kondo scattering due to the local moments induced by Zn is playing a key role."

447,P065024523-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,1,"Thermodynamic critical field curves have been measured for La2−xSrxCuO 4+δ over the full range of carrier concentra- tions where superconductivity occurs in order to determine changes in the normal state density of states with carrier con- centration. There is a substantial window in the H − T plane where the measurements are possible because the samples are both thermodynamically reversible and the temperature is low enough that vortex fluctuations are not important. In this window, the data fit Hao-Clem rather well, so this model is used to determine Hc and κc for each temperature and car- rier concentration. Using N (0) and the ratio of the energy gap to transition temperature, ∆(0)/kBTc, as fitting param- eters, the Hc vs T curves give ∆(0)/kB Tc ∼ 2.0 over the whole range of x. Values of N (0) remain rather constant in the optimum-doped and overdoped regime, but drops quickly toward zero in the underdoped regime. ."

The determination of N (0) from specific heat data, however, is made difficult because the lattice spe- cific heat is large and because the upper critical field is above the reach of the magnets available. Another ap- proach to the changes in N (0) is through the study of optical conductivity. 4 By assuming a Drude like absorp- tion and integrating over all frequencies, it was found that N (0) rises in the underdoped region and levels off in the overdoped region."

In addition, we wish to compare the thermodynamic critical fields of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ with those of classical supercon- ductors and with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) picture. Within the BCS model and succeeding strong coupling modifications, 6 the ratio of the critical field at T = 0 to the critical temperature, H o /k B T c is related to N (0) and the curvature of the H c vs. T curve is related to the ratio of the energy gap at T = 0 to transition temper- ature, ∆(0)/k B T c .

Exten- sive measurements 7 of a high quality single crystal of La 1.90 Sr 0.10 CuO 4+δ have shown that the superconduct- ing magnetization curves, M sc vs. H, of this moderately underdoped high temperature superconductor obeys the Hao-Clem model 8 over a wide range of temperature, T , and magnetic fields, H. The Hao-Clem model is a variational calculation developed originally for the Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ system and it was shown to describe the magnetization curves, well for both Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ 9 and La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ system. In the La 1.90 Sr 0.10 CuO 4+δ studies, it also was found that the normal state back- ground magnetization follows a 2D Heisenberg model 10 for the Cu spins with values close to those measured previously by Nakano and coworkers. In addition, this x = 0.10 sample showed a vortex fluctuation contribution to the magnetization 12 close to T c . The presence of these fluctuations limits the temperature range of applicabil- ity of Hao-Clem because they introduce a new term in the free energy. We only use Hao-Clem in regions where these fluctuations do not contribute significantly. At low temperature irreversibility of the magnetization prevents equilibrium magnetization measurements and close to T c, fluctuations make Hao-Clem inapplicable. Even so, there is a window for each x-value where Hao-Clem works well and thermodynamic critical fields can be measured."

In the early part of the experiment, it was thought that it would be easier to control the oxy- gen content in grain-aligned-powders than in single crys- tals because the diffusion distance for oxygen would be less. Single crystals from three different sources, however, have given essentially the same result as the powders. Magnetically aligned samples were prepared by grinding appropriate amounts of La 2 O 3 , SrCO 3 and CuO in an agate mortar and pestle. Mixed and ground powders were pressed into pellets, placed in an alumina boat, and initially fired for 24h at 750 • C. This was followed by grinding, pelletizing, and firing several times at 850 • C and 970 • C for 48 and 72h respectively. After several cy- cles at these temperatures, the grinding, pelletizing and sintering was done at successively higher temperatures of 1000 • C, 1050 • C, and 1100 • C in a tube with oxygen flowing at 2.5cm 3 /min for 24h each time. Measurements of T c and zero-field-cooled Meissner screening fraction at 1.0 mT were carried out as the first test for sample qual- ity.

This diffusion contribution gives rise to the robust negative values of S in the OD region while R H maintains a positive sign which is inconsistent with a simple FL picture . In this region, currently reported thermopower varies linearly with temperature (FL behavior). However, the S(T) behavior of Bi(La)-2201 compounds shows a deviation from this T-linear behavior , which have been also displayed by recent theoretical studies .

For comparison, the above analysis has also been extended to Bi(La)-2201 ceramics . Corresponding results are plotted in (b) and 4(c) as solid lines. As the diffusion thermopower is very sensitive to the electronic structure, the evolution of S diff with doping clearly indicates a general evolution in the electronic states with doping in these one-layer materials."

484,P066020503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,14,"Any attempt to explain the above results should take into consideration a large hole-like Fermi surface in the strongly overdoped region in Bi(La)-2201 and Bi 1.8 Pb 0.38 Sr 2 CuO 6-δ (Bi(Pb)-2201) compounds and the existence of a saddle point, located at (0,π) in the Brillouin zone . Its position becomes closer to the Fermi surface with increasing doping and it is located around 5 meV below the Fermi surface (FS) in the strongly overdoped case of Bi(Pb)-2201 (T c <4 K) . Thus, the saddle point, giving rise to a van Hove singularity (VHS) in the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, emphasizes narrow band properties."
485,P066020503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,15,"A previous theoretical attempt to evaluate thermopower S(T) in the vicinity of a saddle point giving a non-linear T behavior in the OD region was reported in reference . However, the zero thermopower value, S=0, was found when the Fermi level lies on the saddle point. In this case, the Fermi surface becomes electron-like on the OD side, which is not in agreement with photoemission measurements . The negative electron-like diffusion thermopower and positive hole-like Hall coefficient in OD region can be explained within a tight-binding band model of the CuO 2 square lattice involving VHS . The two-faced electron character in the perpendicular and parallel directions to the Fermi surface is in good agreement with the observed hole- like FS in the strongly OD region . However, the Sommerfeld expansion used in reference gives rise to a linear-T variation of S diff (T). The more accurate procedure, taking into account a rapid variation of the DOS in a few k B T (Fermi window) around Fermi level, leads to the deviation of the thermopower from this metallic behavior . The obtained curvature of S(T) (when VHS lies around 5 meV below Fermi level) is less pronounced and has a smaller slope α∼0.1 µV/K than in our case for the most overdoped sample (δ=0.18). One recent theoretical work takes into account the different contributions to the thermopower along the MY (0,π)→(π,π) direction where band dispersion is very narrow with a low Fermi velocity v f (hot states) and along the ΓY (0,0)→(π,π) direction with wide band dispersion and high v f (cold states) . The slope α, principally controlled by the density of states in the cold region, is still smaller (α∼0.08 µV/K) than our determined values for strongly OD states. The evaluated S(T) in the OD region shows also deviations from T-linear behavior, but even less pronounced than in the previous model."
486,P066020503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,16,"All these models include the narrow band properties and the existence of a peak in the density of states near the Fermi surface. This can be also indirectly probed from the susceptibility and the electronic specific heat measurements .  The increasing of susceptibility with doping, observed on samples with the same composition , indicates an enhancement of the DOS value at the Fermi level. This again emphasizes the growing narrow band properties, in good agreement with the increasing slope of the DOS seen in (b). In the absence of a detailed evolution of band dispersions in the OD region, our measurements suggest a rapid approaching of the Fermi level to the van Hove singularity with doping and the expected topological change from hole-like to electron-like Fermi surface for slightly higher hole number (p>0.28). We should note, however, that the possible difference between experimental results and the above theoretical calculations could also arise from the incommensurate superstructure in the BiO layer and the related umklapp scattering ."
487,P066020503-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,17,"In summary, we have presented the doping evolution of the thermoelectric power S(T) of Bi-2201 ceramics in the overdoped region. The diffusion thermopower S diff (T) shows a deviation from currently reported T-linear variation. The drag contribution to the total thermopower, as previously found, diminishes with increasing doping, suggesting its magnetic origin. After subtraction of this drag term, the evolution of the diffusion part from nearly T-linear behavior to a pronounced curvature indicates growing narrow band properties near the Fermi level and the proximity of a topological change of the Fermi surface."

489,SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,1,"The infinite-layer compound ACuO2 (A = alkaline-earth ions) is regarded as the most suitable material for exploring the fundamental nature of the CuO2 plane because it does not contain a charge-reservoir block, such as a rock-salt or a fluorite like block. We report that superconductivity in the infinite-layer compound Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 is of a three-dimensional nature, in contrast to the quasi two-dimensional superconducting behavior of all other cuprates. The key observation is that the c-axis coherence length is longer than the c-axis lattice constant even at zero temperature. This means that the superconducting order parameter of one CuO2 plane overlaps with those of neighboring CuO2 planes all the temperatures below the Tc. Among all cuprates, only the infinite- layer superconductor shows such a feature."
490,SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"The key ingredient of high-temperature superconduc- tors (HTSC) is the CuO 2 plane in which superconduc- tivity occurs. Besides the CuO 2 plane, the unit cell of HTSC generally contains a charge-reservoir block (CRB) which supplies holes or electrons into the conducting layer. However, the function of the CRB, beyond sup- plying carriers in the materials, is not yet completely clear. In one respect, the CRB might simply be a spacer between the CuO 2 planes. In this case, the block reduces the layer-by-layer coupling. The strong anisotropic na- ture of HTSC is believed to be a reflection of this weak interlayer coupling. In this context, the infinite-layer compounds ACuO 2 (A = alkaline-earth ions) are remark- able, because they do not have a CRB, so the simplicity of their crystal structure may allow in-depth insight into the basic mechanism of cuprate superconductivity. Due to the absence of the CRB, infinite-layer compounds have two notable features. First, the distance from one unit cell to the next is the shortest among all the cuprates. Secondly, as a matter of course, charge carriers can be supplied only from the cations at the A sites. For example, the carrier density of the stoichometric infinite- layer SrCuO 2 is zero. The partial substitution of La +3 (or Nd +3 ) for Sr +2 results in superconductivity in these compounds. In this case, the carriers are not holes, but electrons."
491,SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,3,"Recently, we successfully synthesized pure-phase Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 (Sr(La)-112) with T c ≃ 43 K by using a cubic multi-anvil press. The details of the sample prepa- ration will be given elsewhere. In this work, we mea- sured the reversible magnetization as a function of the temperature and the angle between the c axis and the applied magnetic field. From analysis of the data, we found that the usual HTSC two-dimensional (2D) tem- perature region of ξ c (T ) < c below T c did not exist in this compound. This peculiar feature has not been observed in any other high-T c material. Until now, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Y-123) has been known to have the most strong inter- layer coupling, but the three-dimensional (3D) tempera- ture region is limited to near T c only. Previously, it was claimed that the high-T c superconductivity occurred only on the 2D network of CuO 2 planes, since a 3D net- work did not permit spin or charge fluctuation while a 1D structure did not establish long range order of super- conductivity. Hence, our observation of 3D superconduc- tivity in entire region below T c in Sr(La)-112 provides a new aspect of high-temperature superconductivity."

493,SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,5,"shows the reversible magnetization, 4πM (T ), at fields of 1 T ≤ H ≤ 5 T parallel to the c axis of the sample. In this figure, the symbols and the lines denote the zero-field-cooled and the field-cooled magnetizations, respectively. In comparison with other cuprates, our data show two interesting features. First, the curves shift to lower temperature as the field increases and are almost parallel to each other. This typical mean-field behavior is consistent with the prediction of the Abrikosov model in which the magnetization scales linearly with the magnetic field. Such a feature has never been observed before for any high-T c cuprate because the mean-field behavior is usually screened by strong thermal fluctua- tions. Secondly, the rate of decrease of T c (H) with respect to the field is significantly larger than that of other cuprates, here the superconducting transition tem- perature, T c (H), is estimated as the temperature at the point of intersection of a linear extrapolation of 4πM (T ) in the superconducting state with the normal-state base line of 4πM = 0. For instance, at H = 5 T, T c (H) is found to be about 33 K, which corresponds to 0.77T c (0). Hence, the upper-critical field H c2 (0) is expected to be about 20 T, assuming a linear T c (H). To determine H c2 (0) precisely, we apply the Hao-Clem model for re- versible magnetization to our data. The details of the analysis will be given elsewhere (M.-S. Kim et al., manuscript in preparation). Two important parameters characterizing the compound are the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, κ, and the slope of the upper-critical field near T c , dH c2 /dT | Tc . The Hao-Clem model analysis gives κ = 25.3 ± 1.1 and dH c2 /dT | Tc = −0.47 ± 0.02 T/K. Using these, we estimate H c2 (0) to be 13.9 ± 0.5 T through the relationship H c2 (0) ≃ 0.7(dH c2 /dT ) Tc T c, which is about ten times smaller than the value for other cuprate superconductors. The in-plane coher- ence length ξ ab (0) = [φ 0 /2πH c2 (0)] 1/2 is calculated to be 48.6 ± 1.0Å, where φ 0 is the flux quantum. In our study, we apply the Hao-Clem model to de- scribe our magnetization data. Since the model is derived from the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, our result is justified in the GL framework. However, we judge our result not to be model depen- dent particularly from the following consideration: The open symbols in the inset of represent the in-plane magnetic penetration depth, λ ab (T ), obtained from the dc-magnetic susceptibility, 4πχ(T ), for the low-field re- gion of H < H c1 . To deduce λ ab (T ) from the 4πχ(T ) curve, we use the Shoenberg formula, which is not model dependent, but is merely based on the London equations. For comparison, we also plot λ ab (T ) (filled symbols) from the Hao-Clem analysis in the same figure."
494,SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,6,"We can see that the two curves, indeed, coincide. Thus, we can conclude that the application of the Hao-Clem model in this study does not reduce the generality of our results."

The estimated zero-temperature penetration depth, λ ab (0), is 147 ± 6 nm, which is close to λ ab (0) ≃ 130 nm of Y-123. In the framework of the London model, the penetration depth is proportional to (m * ab /n s ) 1/2 , where m * and n s are the electronic effective mass in the ab plane and the charge-carrier density, re- spectively. According to the empirical Uemura relation, i.e., T c ∼ n s /m * ab , the T c 's of the two compounds should be nearly the same. However, the T c of Sr(La)-112 is about half that of Y-123. This discordance might differentiate Sr(La)-112 from the hole-doped cuprates."
496,SSC1230017-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,8,"For the cuprate superconductors studied until now, the zero-temperature coherence length along the c axis, ξ c (0), was found to be much smaller than the unit c- axis length. As the temperature increased toward T c , a dimensional crossover from 2D to 3D occurred at a certain temperature T * where ξ c (T * ) = c/ √ 2. For moderately anisotropic materials like Y-123, a broader 3D-temperature region around T c was observed due to strong interlayer coupling. However, the 3D region for strongly anisotropic compounds, such as Bi-and Tl- based superconductors, was found to be extremely nar- row."

With our high- quality samples, we designed experiments to obtain the anisotropy ratio γ = ξ ab /ξ c .

Previ- ously, Farrell et al. measured the magnetic torque curves for highly anisotropic Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 (Bi-2212) and moderately anisotropic Y-123. By applying the Lon- don model to the data, they obtained the anisotropy ra- tios γ ≃ 55 and γ ≃ 5 for Bi-2212 and Y-123, respectively. On the other hand, we obtained the anisotropy ratio of Sr(La)-112 by measuring M L (θ) using a SQUID magne- tometer with a sample rotator.

In this figure, the solid lines represent the theoretical prediction of the Hao-Clem model. We see a good fit, except for temperatures above T = 39 K. We infer that the departure of the data from the theoretical lines at higher temperatures is due to the thermal fluctuation effect, which becomes more important as the tempera- ture increases. The inset of is a plot of the anisotropy ratio obtained from each curve in . The filled and the open symbols are deduced by application of the Hao-Clem and the London models, respectively. In the filled-symbol set, the curve shows a plateau behav- ior at low temperatures and then increases monotonically with temperature. The increase is postulated to originate from the thermal fluctuation effect, as mentioned above. In the open-symbol set, however, no such plateau feature exists. In fact, the London model is known to be suitable for the low-field region of H ≪ H c2 . Since our magneti- zation data were taken near the transition temperature, the external field of 1 T is regarded as considerably large. Thus, our data set is out of the London region. This is consistent with the 4πM (T ) data in , which lie in the Abrikosov region."

The criterion for 3D superconductivity below T c is ξ c (T ) > c/ √ 2. The value of ξ ab (0) = 5.4Å is con- siderably larger than the c/ √ 2 ≃ 2.4Å.

Similar to the cuprates and heavy fermions, superconductivity in iron arsenides emerges close to the magnetic instability. There are mainly two classes of Fe-arsenides showing superconductivity. RFeAsO crystallizes in the ZrCuSiAs-type structure, composed by alternating (RO) and FeAs layers. The other class of compounds belongs to the well known ThCr 2 Si 2 -type structure (so called 122 family), AFe 2 As 2 (A: Ba, Sr, Eu or Ca) composed of FeAs layers separated by A-layers. Superconductivity in these systems is induced by partial hole or electron doping of the FeAs layers, which otherwise order magnetically. Electron doping has been highly successful for RFeAsO by substitution of oxygen by fluorine or by oxide vacancies, whereas K or Na doping is more successful for AFe 2 As 2 compounds. EuFe 2 As 2 belongs to the so-called 122 family. We have recently performed systematic physical property measurements on EuFe 2 As 2 single crystals and Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 polycrystals . A very similar magnetic transition related to Fe 2 As 2 layers was revealed in EuFe 2 As 2 and other AFe 2 As 2 systems. EuFe 2 As 2 undergoes a SDW magnetic transition at 190 K due to Fe ordering, accompanied by a structural transition .

By doping Potassium to the Eu lattice (hole doping), Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 shows the suppression of the SDW transition and the appearance of a SC phase transition at 32 K. We have also measured the magnetic penetration depth λ(T ) for polycrystalline samples of Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 , which shows deviations from conventional behavior. A minimum in the penetration depth vs temperature at 4.2 K suggests a strong influence of the Eu magnetic ordering on the supercondusting properties.

The broad anomaly at the SC transition ( 32K) arises possibly due to the non-uniform distribution of the dopant concentration. Due to a large phonon contribution at the superconductivity transition a reliable estimation of the normal-state electronic specific heat is difficult. Additionally, there is a magnetic contribution from Eu 2+ moments, which could not easily be subtracted from the measured data. For this reason we are limited in the experimental determination of ∆C p /T c . There is a clear anomaly at the SC transition for x= 0.45 and 0.5, which confirms the bulk nature of the phase transition; the AFM ordering of Eu spins is suppressed after K doping. The SC anomaly is clearer in C p /T vs T (lower inset of Fig. ) and a small increase in the electronic specific heat below 10 K is due to the Eu spins. Furthermore, we have subtracted the phonon contribution, derived from the SrFe 2 As 2 specific heat (yielding the specific heat increment δC shown in the upper inset of Fig. ), which gives a rough estimation of the electronic specific heat of Eu 0.55 K 0.45 Fe 2 As 2 . Due to the substantial width of the SC transition, ∆C p /T c and T c values were determined from this δC/T vs T plot. The estimated jump ∆C p /T c is approximately 70 mJ/mol K 2 , resulting in a ratio ∆C/(γT c ) which is substantially larger than the BCS value of 1.43, hinting at a strong-coupling scenario."

It has been identified recently as a topological superconductor (TSC) with an extraordinary nematic, i.e., C 2 -symmetric superconducting state and odd-parity pairing.

Under out-of-plane fields (B ⊥ ), we discover elongated magnetic vortices hosting zero-bias conductance peaks consistent with the Majorana bound states expected in a TSC. Under in-plane fields (B == ), the average superconducting gap exhibits twofold symmetry with field orientation; the long C 2 symmetry axes are pinned to the dihedral mirror planes under B == ¼ 0.5 T but rotate slightly under B == ¼ 1.0 T. Moreover, a nodeless Δ 4x gap structure is semiquantitatively determined for the first time.

519,PhysRevX.8.041024-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,5,"Recently, a nematic superconducting state was discov- ered in a NMR study of Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 (Ref. ). The spin susceptibility in the superconducting state exhibits twofold symmetry when rotating the in-plane magnetic field, which is surprising considering the threefold symmetry of the lattice. This symmetry breaking, together with the invariance of the Knight shift upon crossing T c under an out-of-plane field, indicates the Cooper pairs are in a pseudo-spin-triplet state with a pinned d-vector direction . Subsequently, measurements on Cu-, Sr-, and Nb-doped Bi 2 Se 3 superconductors all revealed twofold symmetry in the in-plane field angular dependence of the specific heat, upper critical field, critical current, and magnetoresistance below T c (Refs. ). These remarkable observations in Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 have established it as an odd-parity TSC state , with the d vector pinned to a specific lattice axis by strong spin-orbit coupling. However, contradictions still exist, especially in the gap symmetry and the pinning directions of the d vectors among the reported bulk and/or macroscopic measurements . The d vector is reported to be pinned along the Se─Se bond direction in a NMR study by Matano et al. , but it lies along the dihedral mirror plane of the Se lattice in specific heat measurements by Yonezawa et al. and magnetoresistance measurements by Pan et al. .

Moreover, as shown in , the terraces are rough, with many Cu clusters distributed on them. It appears that the spacing between Bi 2 Se 3 quintuple layers in this region is expanded consid- erably by Cu intercalation, which will lead to a more two- dimensional structure. The SC-I region is adjacent to the NSC region shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Although the surface lattice cannot be directly seen in the SC-I region, the orientation of atomic step edges suggests it has the same lattice orientation with the nearby NSC region (see Part 1D of Ref. for details). The dI=dV spectrum obtained in the SC-I regions [] exhibits a similar Dirac- conelike feature, but the Dirac point is now 650 meV below E F .

We note that the heavy-electron-doping effect may be critical for the origin of superconductivity here. Such a U-shaped gap is spatially homogeneous in the SC-I region, and it is insensitive to Cu clusters and step edges,as shown in (k) and in Ref. . Usually for spin-triplet superconductors, such as Sr 2 RuO 4 , the super- conductivity is very sensitive to impurities .

Far from the vortex, the superconducting gap is only slightly affected [blue curves in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e)], and it is gradually suppressed upon approaching the vortex core. Within a few nanometers of one vortex core center, weak ZBCPs are observed with a full width at half maximum of about 0.29 meV [red curves in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e)]. This ZBCP is observed for the first time in vortices of Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 (Refs. ). It could be composed of both conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound states and the long-predicted Majorana bound state expected at zero energy in 2D TSC. These are hard to distinguish because the energy separation of the bound states δE ¼ Δ 2 =E F (Ref. ) is about 0.4 μeV here, assuming Δ k ¼ 0.5 meV and E F ¼ 650 meV. Nevertheless, our observation of a ZBCP is consistent with the prediction of TSC in Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 . As shown in (f) and Figs. S9(d), S9(e), and S10 in Ref. , ZBCPs have also been observed in some vortex cores under B ⊥ ¼ 0.3 T, but their intensities are slightly weaker than under B ⊥ ¼ 0.2 T. The spectrum near zero bias is distorted for B ⊥ ¼ 0.4 T, and the ZBCP is clearly absent for B ⊥ ¼ 0.6 T, as shown in and in Ref. . This behavior resembles the evolution of the Majorana zero-energy mode observed in 5-QL Bi 2 Te 3 films grown on NbSe 2 (Ref. ). The weakening and disappearance of a ZBCP in the vortex core under high field is interpreted as a result of the coupling between states in adjacent vortices . When the field is small, the distance between vortices is large compared to the vortex core size, so the interaction between the vortex bound states can be neglected. Upon increasing field, the intervortex distance shortens, enhancing these interactions and even- tually destroying the Majorana zero mode ."

Under various B == , no obvious in-plane vortices are observed on the surface, and the superconduct- ing spectra are spatially homogeneous (see Part 4 of Ref. for more details). This phenomenon is possible because the superconductivity on the surface (likely resides in topological surface state) is more robust to the orbital depairing of an in-plane field so that the bulk vortex lines are pushed away from the surface, as shown theoretically in Ref. . Consequently, the in-plane field does not gen- erate noticeable spatial inhomogeneity on the supercon- ducting spectrum.

Clearly, the superconducting gap, as estimated from both the leading edge (Δ Ã LE ) and coherence peaks (Δ Ã CP ), varies with θ. We use asterisks (*) here to emphasize that these actually constitute weighted averages of Δ k under B == . The angular dependence of Δ Ã CP and Δ Ã LE based on an extensive data set is summarized in and exhibits clear twofold symmetry, with maxima around θ ¼ 90°and 270°(coincid- ing with the y axis) and minima near θ ¼ 0°and 180°( coinciding with the x axis). show similar twofold symmetry for B == ¼ 1.0 T. In addition, Δ Ã LE along θ ¼ 85°, 40°, and 0°decrease monotonically with increasing B == , and no crossover is observed between them, as shown in and in Ref. . Our detailed experiments indicate that the superconducting gap (Δ Ã CP and Δ Ã LE ) of Cu x Bi 2 Se 3 exhibits twofold symmetry throughout the studied B == range from 0.25 to 1.5 T. The suppression of the superconducting gap by B == is much faster along the x axis (θ ¼ 0°) than nearly along the y axis (θ ¼ 85°), suggesting a smaller upper critical field B c2 along the x axis. Thus, a larger ξ y is evaluated than ξ x from the Ginzburg-Landau relations B x c2 ¼ ½ðΦ 0 Þ=ð2πξ c ξ y Þ and B y c2 ¼ ½ðΦ 0 Þ=ð2πξ c ξ x Þ, which is consistent with our obser- vations that the vortex is elongated along the y axis of the lattice shown in .

For Δ Ã LE , the oscillation amplitude increases from 8.7% under B == ¼ 0.25 T to 28.9% under B == ¼ 1.5 T, while for Δ Ã CP it changes from 5.1% to 8.1%. The gradual smearing of the gap edge (Δ Ã LE ) of the DOS under B == is consistent with the Volovik effect; the quasiparticle energy spectrum is Doppler shifted in the mixed state due to a supercurrent flow running around the vortices, which leads to a broad- ening of the gap edge even for a nodeless superconductor at finite temperature ."

536,PhysRevX.8.041024-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,22,"orbital depairing effect of B == (in-plane vortex) is not obvious here, the influence of B == on superconductivity mainly includes two effects: the Volovik and Zeeman effects. The former effect has been extensively studied in nodal superconductors theoretically and exper- imentally and leads to a DOS under B == that exhibits characteristic oscillatory behavior with field ori- entation. At low temperature and low field, as illustrated in , more quasiparticles are excited when the field is perpendicular to the gap minimal direction of Δ k than along other directions because the field-induced supercurrents (which run perpendicular to the field) can lead to the strongest Doppler shift of the quasiparticle energy around the gap minimal region. Thus, the short axis of Δ Ã LE is actually perpendicular to the gap minimal direction, since this field orientation produces the most quasiparticle excitations. Meanwhile, the application of B == will induce Zeeman effect, whose energy scale is about 0.1 meV for B == ¼ 1.0 T, comparable to the minimal gap magnitude (0.256 meV) in the SC-I region. For E u -symmetry pairing, the d vector is expected to be parallel to the maximal gap direction of Δ k , and it is normal to the plane in which the spins of the equal-spin-paired electrons are aligned . The Zeeman depairing effect is the strongest when B == is parallel to the d vector because the electron spins may deviate from the original plane under sufficient B == . Therefore, both the Volovik effect and Zeeman effect will suppress Δ Ã LE much more strongly when B == lies along the maximal gap direction of Δ k . Consequently, the distribu- tion of Δ k for the SC-I region can be qualitatively determined; as illustrated by the thick blue curve in , the gap maxima are along a Se─Se bond direction, which is rotated 90°from the long axis of Δ Ã LE . The tunneling spectra here and the specific heat measured by Yonezawa et al. reflect the integrated DOS over the Fermi surface under the influence of B == , and they thus exhibit weaker anisotropy than Δ k , whose anisotropy can be more precisely estimated by fitting the tunneling spectra or via the vortex anisotropy. The blue curve thus gives the first semiquanti- tative sketch of an anisotropic nodeless gap structure in Cu x Bi 2 Se 3. This angular distribution of the Δ k is consistent with the orientation of the observed elongated vortices as, empirically, a vortex will extend out in the direction of a gap minimum (assuming only weak Fermi velocity anisotropy) ."

According to above analysis, the angular distribution of Δ k in domain A is illustrated by the blue curve, with its maxima again along a Se─Se bond direction. Similar to the case of the SC-I region, in domain B of the SC-II region, which has the same lattice orientation as domain A, the long axis of Δ Ã LE under B == ¼ 1.0 T is rotated to an intermediate angle, about 20.7°off another dihedral mirror plane, as shown in and in Ref. . The origin of such a rotation under B == ¼ 1.0 T is unclear and merits future investigation. Our data show that gap nematicity is ubiquitous in all the super- conducting domains of Cu x Bi 2 Se 3, the long C 2 axis of Δ k is pinned along one of the three equivalent Se─Se bond directions, which may vary for different SC domains (see more discussion in Part 9 of Ref. )."

The Δ 4y gap distribution is supported by specific heat and magnetoresistance measurements . However, our data suggest that the gap maxima of Δ k are pinned along one of the three equivalent Se─Se bond directions, consistent with the NMR study and supporting a Δ 4x pairing sym- metry without nodes. The differences among bulk mea- surements remind us that the summed responses from all domains with different gap amplitudes and orientations may give an average gap maximum rotated from the actual ones, as the multidomain effect is directly observed in our study of the SC-II region (Part 9 of Ref. ) and previously discussed by Yonezawa et al. in of their paper .

On the one hand, we observe a Dirac-conelike surface DOS in the SC-I regions, a ZBCP in vortex cores under 0.2-0.3 T out-of- plane fields, and a nematic superconducting order param- eter with an anisotropic gap and a preferential symmetry axis. A nematic superconducting state with an anisotropic gap has been predicted only for odd-parity superconduc- tivity , and the preferential direction of the C 2 symmetry axis of the gap and its highly nontrivial response to field strength indeed suggest a pseudospin triplet pairing . The ZBCP might be the long-sought Majorana bound state, so our findings further support topologically nontrivial superconductivity in this material. On the other hand, many aspects of our data are not readily explained by current theories for TSC. For example, we neither observe in-gap states (and in Ref. ) at the step edge as would be expected for a two-dimensional TSC , nor do we observe in-gap states corresponding to Majorana fermions on the surface as expected for a three- dimensional TSC . It is still mysterious why the predicted point nodes appear to be gapped out and why the long axis of Δ Ã LE rotates under high B == . In short, our findings reveal the microscopic behavior of the nematic superconductivity in Cu x Bi 2 Se 3, which will facilitate an understanding of its extraordinary properties and micro- scopic pairing mechanism, and more importantly, our data impose strong constraints for further improving theories of topological superconductivity."

545,PR05914099-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,1,We have investigated the magnetic and the superconducting properties of the hybrid ruthenate- cuprate compound RuSr2GdCu2O8 by means of zero-field muon spin rotation-(ZF-µSR) and DC magnetization measurements. The DC-magnetisation data establish that this material exhibits ferromagnetic order of the Ru-moments (µ(Ru) ≈ 1 µB) below TCurie = 133 K and becomes su- perconducting at a much lower temperature Tc = 16 K. The ZF-µSR experiments indicate that the ferromagnetic phase is homogeneous on a microscopic scale and accounts for most of the sample volume. They also suggest that the magnetic order is not significantly modified at the onset of superconductivity.
546,PR05914099-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"Since the discovery of superconductivity in the cuprate system La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 in 1986 an ever growing vari- ety of high-T c superconducting cuprate compounds has been synthesized all of which contain CuO 2 planes (some also contain CuO chains) as their essential structural el- ements which host the superconducting charge carriers . Between the CuO 2 planes are various kinds of layers, typ- ically NaCl-type, which are insulating and act merely as a charge reservoir. To date, the ruthenate compound Sr 2 RuO 4 is the only known layered perovskite-like sys- tem which becomes superconducting even though it does not contain any CuO 2 planes or CuO chains . Despite its rather low transition temperature T c = 1.5 K the study of its electronic and magnetic properties has become a very rich and active field of research . In parallel, the electronic and magnetic properties of the related ruthen- ate compounds, such as for example the SrRuO 3 system which is an itinerant 4d-band ferromagnet with T Curie ≈ 165 K, have attracted a great deal of interest ."
547,PR05914099-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,3,"Another potentially promising and exciting direction of research has been prompted by the circumstance that the RuO 2 layers share the same square-planar coor- dination and a rather similar bond length with their CuO 2 counterparts. A whole new family of hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compounds may therefore be con- structed whose members consist of different sequences of alternating RuO 2 -and CuO 2 layers. Recently, one such a hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compound, the 1212-type RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 system comprising CuO 2 bilayers and RuO 2 monolayers, has been synthesized as single-phase material . A subsequent study of its electronic and mag- netic properties has revealed that this material exhibits electronic ferromagnetic order at a rather high Curie tem- perature T Curie =133-136 K and becomes superconduct- ing at a significantly lower critical temperature T c =15-40 K (depending on the condition of preparation and anneal- ing) . The most surprising observation, however, is that the ferromagnetic order does not vanish when super- conductivity sets in at T c . Instead, it appears that the ferromagnetic state remains largely unchanged and coex- ists with superconductivity. This finding implies that the interaction between the superconducting-and the ferro- magnetic order parameters is very weak and it raises the question of whether both order parameters coexist on a truly microscopic scale. Since the early investigations of Ginzburg in 1957 the prevailing view is that the coexis- tence of a superconducting-(with singlet Cooper pairs) and a ferromagnetic order parameter is not possible on a microscopic scale since the electromagnetic interaction and the exchange coupling cause strong pairbreaking. Indeed, merely based on magnetisation and transport measurements one cannot exclude the possibility that the RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 samples may be spatially inhomoge- neous with some domains exhibiting ferromagnetic order and others superconducting order . We note that unam- biguous evidence for the occurence of bulk superconduc- tivity in RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 has recently been obtained from specific heat measurements which reveal a sizeable jump at T c of ∆γ ≡ C p /T ≈ 0.35 mJ/g at.K 2 characteristic of a strongly underdoped cuprate superconductor .

Fur- thermore, the ZF-µSR data establish that the ferromag- netic order is hardly affected by the onset of superconduc- tivity and persists to the lowest available temperature of the experiment T=2.2 K. The ZF-µSR data can be com- plemented by DC-magnetisation measurements which es- tablish the presence of ferromagnetic order from the ob- servation of a spontaneous magnetization at T Curie = 133 K and of hysteretic isothermal magnetic behavior with a remanent magnetization. It is shown that the fer- romagnetic ordering involves the Ru magnetic moments with µ(Ru) ≈ 1.05(5) µ B , while the larger Gd-moments with µ(Gd 3+ ) ≈ 7.4(1) µ B remain paramagnetic down to very low temperatures.

The magnetic moment of the paramagnetic component agrees reasonably well with the expected magnetic moment of Gd 3+ which for a free Gd 3+ -ion is µ(Gd 3+ ) = 7.94 µ B and µ(Gd 3+ ) = 7.4 µ B for the structurally-similar GdBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ compound .

In the ferromagnetic state below T Curie =133 K we find that the spectra are well described by the relaxation function: (1) where ν µ is the average muon spin precession frequency which corresponds to the average value of the sponta- neous internal magnetic field at the muons sites, ν µ = γ µ /2π • B µ , with γ µ = 835.4 MHz/T the gyromagnetic ratio.

Before we discuss the ZF-µSR data in more detail, we first emphasize the most important implications, which are evident from Figs. . Firstly, the presence of an oscillating component in the ZF-µSR spectra for T <T Curie = 133 K gives unambiguous evidence for an ordered magnetic state which is homogeneous on a mi- croscopic length scale (of typically 20Å). Secondly, from the amplitude of the oscillating component (A 1 ≈2/3) we can deduce that the magnetically-ordered state accounts for more or less the entire volume of the sample. And thirdly, from the temperature dependence of the µSR signal it becomes clear that the magnetic order persists almost unchanged in the superconducting state."
564,PR05914099-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,20,"In the following we outline how the volume fraction of the magnetically-ordered phase is obtained from the amplitude of the oscillating component of the ZF-µSR spectra. For a polycrystalline sample with randomly- orientated grains in zero external field the local magnetic field, on average, is parallel (perpendicular) to the di- rection of the muon spin direction with probability 1/3 (2/3). For a homogeneous magnetically-ordered sam- ple one therefore expects that 2/3 of the amplitude of the ZF-µSR signal (the transverse component) exhibit an oscillatory behavior, while 1/3 of the signal (the lon- gitudinal component) is non-oscillating and only slowly damped due to spin-flip excitations. On the other hand, for a sample with inhomogeneous magnetic order, for ex- ample containing non-magnetic regions, the amplitude of the oscillating signal will be accordingly reduced and a second non-oscillating transverse component will ap- pear. If the non-magnetic regions are microscopically small, this non-oscillating component is likely to have a rather large damping rate of the order of λ ∼ γ µ • B µ due to stray fields which are imposed by the neighbor- ing magnetic domains. From Fig. (a) and 7(b) it can be seen that the ZF-µSR data on RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 give no indication for such an inhomogeneous magnetic state. As was mentioned above, the amplitude of the initial muon spin polarization P(t = 0) has been determined from a transverse-field (TF)-µSR measurement. From the size of the amplitude of the oscillatory component we deduce that more than 80 % of the sample is mag- netically ordered below T Curie = 133 K. Based on this analysis we estimate that the volume fraction of any dis- ordered magnetic-or non-magnetic phase must be well below 20%. Note that some of the muons (typically 10- 20 %) do not stop inside the sample but somewhere in the cryostat walls. In the ZF-µSR experiment these muons give rise to a missing fraction since their spin-polarization is much more slowly damped than for the rest of the signal. In the TF-µSR experiment, however, this very slowly damped component can be detected via its pre- cession in the external field and it contributes to the to- tal muon spin polarization P(0). The 80% fraction of the magnetically ordered phase therefore has to be regarded as a lower bound. In fact, it is rather likely that the entire sample volume is magnetically ordered. Finally, we note that the muons apparently occupy only one muon site, since only one precession frequency is seen in the ZF-µSR spectra. Also it is clear from the ZF-µSR data that muon diffusion effects are negligibly small below T Curie = 133 K, similar to the other cuprate superconductors where muon diffusion is observed only at significantly higher temperatures of T ≥ 250 K 13 ."
565,PR05914099-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,21,"It is evident from Fig. that the muon spin pre- cession frequency (the local field at the muon site) does not exhibit any strong anomaly at the superconducting transition temperature T c . Instead, as shown by the dashed line, the temperature of the muon spin preces- sion frequency ν µ (T ) (and thus of the magnetic order parameter) is well described by the function ν µ (T ) = ν o (1 − T /T c ) β , with ν o = 9.7(1) MHz (corresponding to B µ (T → 0) ≈ 720(10) G), T c = 133(1) K, and β = 0.333. This functional form is strictly valid only in the critical regime close to T Curie but it can be seen to provide a reasonable description of the magnetic order parameter over a fairly wide temperature range of T Curie T 5 K. The anomaly at very low temperature arises most likely from the magnetic ordering transition of the Gd-moments at T N ≈2.6 K. Note that for the struc- turally related compound GdBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Gd-123) the antiferromagnetic ordering transition of the Gd-moment occurs at a very similar temperature of T N =2.3K . The value of the critical exponent β = 0.333 is close to the theoretical value 0.345 in the 3D XY model . We can- not determine with certainty the number of components in the spin system with these data and, in particular, dis- tinguish between the 2-component XY (β= 0.345) and the 3-component Heisenberg (β = 0.365) models.

Instead, we emphasize that the observed spread in the local magnetic field can be accounted for by the grain boundary effects and by the differences in the demagnetization factors of the individual grains which naturally arise for a polycrystalline sample that has a very small average grain size of about 1 µm 8 . Also, we point out that recent transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM) studies have revealed that our present Ru-1212 sample contains [100] rotation twins and also exhibits some cationic disorder due to the intermixing of Sr ↔ Gd and to a lesser extent of Ru ↔ Cu 8 . These kinds of structural imperfections certainly tend to further in- crease the transverse relaxation rate λ of the ZF-µSR spectra. Meanwhile, we have prepared Ru-1212 sam- ples which are structurally more perfect (by sintering at slightly higher temperature and for longer periods) . Re- cent DC-magnetization measurements have shown that these crystallographic defects do not affect the funda- mental magnetic and superconducting behavior. In fact, both the superconducting-and the ferromagnetic tran- sitions become somewhat sharper and T c and T Curie are slightly increased for these structurally more perfect samples . Additional µSR measurements on these sam- ples are presently under way."
567,PR05914099-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,23,"The temperature dependence of the relaxation rate of the non-oscillating component of the ZF-µSR signal, Λ(T) ∼ 1/T , is shown in Fig. . As a function of decreasing temperature Λ(T ) can be seen to exhibit a cusp-like feature at the ferromagnetic transition of the Ru-moments at T Curie =133 K and a step-like increase at very low temperature which most likely is related to the ordering of the Gd moments. The cusp feature at T Curie = 133 K characterizes the slowing down of the spin dy- namics of the Ru-moments as the ferromagnetic tran- sition is approached. The cusp maximum occurs when the spin fluctuation rate, τ c , equals the typical µSR time scale for τ c ∼ 10 −611 . Note, that in the ferromagnetically- ordered state the longitudinal relaxation rate remains unusually large with values of Λ(T <<T Curie ) ≈ 0.3- 0.4 µs −1 that are at least an order of magnitude larger than expected for a classical ferromagnet (where two- magnon excitations provide the major contribution to spin dynamics). We have confirmed by a µSR measure- ments in a longitudinal field of H LF =6 kOe that this large relaxation rate is indeed characteristic for the lon- gitudinal component of the µSR signal. At present we cannot provide a definite explanation of the origin of the unusually large value of Λ. However, we emphasize that the RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 system can be expected to ex- hibit a rather complex magnetic behavior since, besides the ferromagnetically-ordered Ru moments, it also con- tains the larger Gd moments with µ(Gd 3+ ) ≈ 7.4 µ B which remain paramagnetic below T Curie . The magnetic ordering transition of the Gd moments at T≈2.6 K is evident in the ZF-µSR data in Fig. from the sudden increase in the local magnetic field (or the µSR precession frequency, ν µ ) and a corresponding increase in both relaxation rates, λ and Λ. In addition, we note that recently it has been shown by µSR measurements that in strongly underdoped high-T c cuprate supercon- ductors (like the present RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 compound) also the Cu moments exhibit a spin-glass type freezing tran- sition at low temperature . Finally, it appears that the longitudinal relaxation rate Λ exhibits an additional weak anomaly at a temperature of T≈20 K, i.e. in the vicinity of the superconducting transition at T c =16 K. At present we are not sure whether this effect is related to the onset of superconductivity. From Fig. it appears that the transverse relaxation rate also exhibits a steplike increase in the same temperature range. The local magnetic field at the muon site, however, (see Fig. ) does not seem to exhibit any anomaly in the vicinity of T c . We ex- pect that further µSR measurements on rare earth (RE) substituted RuSr 2 Gd 1−x RE x Cu 2 O 8 samples, as well as on less strongly underdoped samples with higher critical temperatures of T c up to 40 K, should shed more light on the complex magnetic behavior and its interplay with superconductivity in the Ru-1212 system."
568,PR05914099-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,24,"While the ZF-µSR data give clear evidence for the presence of a homogeneous magnetically ordered state, they do not provide any direct information about the origin of the magnetic moments, the type of the mag- netic order and its direction. Based on dipolar-field cal- culations of the local magnetic field at the muon site, however, one can test the consistency with an assumed magnetic structure. The result of these calculations de- pends on the location of the interstitial muon site and also on the orientation of the Ru-moments. Unfortu- nately, for the Ru-1212 system neither of these is accu- rately known at present. Nevertheless, it seems plausible that the muon site is similar to that in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (and other related cuprate compounds) where the posi- tive muon forms a hydroxyl bond with the apex oxygen and is located at the so-called 'apical-site' near the point (0.12a,0.225b,0.14c) . Indeed, as is summarized in table , we obtain rather good agreement with the experimen- tal value of B µ (T→0) = 720 G if we take a similar apical-site near the point (0.13a, 0.22b, 0.16-0.17c) and assume that the ferromagnetically-ordered Ru-moments (µ(Ru)=1 µ B ) are oriented along the RuO 2 plane ei- ther along the Ru-O bond, [100], or along the diago- nal [110] (see table ). For the [110] orientation, how- ever, there exist two magnetically inequivalent muon sites which should give rise to two distinctive precession fre- quencies in the µSR spectra (which are not observed ex- perimentally). For the Ru-moments oriented perpendic- ular to the RuO 2 layer along the resulting local magnetic field at the apex-site is significantly larger than the experimental value. In order to obtain reasonable agreement with experiment for the [001]-orientation one has to assume that the muon site is located much closer to the CuO 2 planes. Such a muon site, however, is not very realistic (simply speaking the positive muon is re- pelled by the positively charged CuO 2 planes) and has not been observed in any of the related cuprate com- pounds. We thus tentatively conclude that the moments align in-plane consistent with the 2-component XY sce- nario. While this result is rather convenient in terms of the coexistence of the ferromagnetic order of the Ru moments and the superconductivity which resides within the CuO 2 layers as discussed below, one has to keep in mind that the underlying assumptions are rather crude. For more detailed and decisive information on the struc- ture and the orientation of the Ru spin order we must await the result of neutron scattering experiments."
569,PR05914099-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,25,"Having established that the ferromagnetic and the su- perconducting order parameter coexist on a microscopic scale, we arrive at the important question as to how this system manages to avoid strong pair-breaking effects. We suspect that the answer is closely related to the lay- ered structure of the hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compound and, in particular, to the purely two-dimensional coher- ent charge transport in the strongly underdoped CuO 2 planes. We envisage a scenario where the ferromagneti- cally ordered Ru spins are aligned in the RuO 2 plane hav- ing a very large out-of-plane anisotropy while the charge dynamics of the superconducting CuO 2 planes is purely two-dimensional, i.e., coherent charge transport occurs only along the direction of the CuO 2 planes. For such a configuration the principal pair-breaking effect due to the electromagnetic interaction can be minimized, since the dot product of the magnetic vector potential (which then is normal to the planes) and the momentum of the Cooper pair (which is parallel to the planes) vanishes. An additional requirement is that the direct hyperfine interaction between the superconducting electrons of the CuO 2 planes and the ordered Ru spins has to be ex- tremely small. Both requirements may be fulfilled in the present Ru-1212 system due to the confinement of the superconducting electrons of the strongly underdoped CuO 2 planes. The absence of magnetic pairbreaking is suggested by the fact that the T c value is fully consistent with the underdoped state indicated by the thermoelec- tric power . So far we have been unable to significantly increase the doping state (by e.g. Ca substitution) so as to explore these implications. Furthermore, we have not yet succeeded in crystallographically aligning pow- ders or growing single crystals which would allow one to investigate the magnetic anisotropy. However, further information can be obtained by examining the ferromag- netic fluctuations above T Curie as seen in the divergence of the susceptibility. Figure shows dχ/dT plotted ver- sus (T/T Curie -1) for the zero-field-cooled susceptibility for T >T Curie . The slope of -2.30(3) indicates a critical exponent of γ = 1.30(3) consistent with 3D XY fluctu- ations for which γ = 1.32 18 and again consistent with orientation of the Ru-moments within the a-b plane."

Finally, we note that an alternative (and highly spec- ulative) explanation for the coexistence of high-T c su- perconductivity and ferromagnetic order in the present Ru-1212 superconductor could be that the supercon- ducting order parameter has a non-zero angular momen- tum which itself breaks time-reversal symmetry. Such a highly unconventional order parameter symmetry has been discussed also in the context of the Sr 2 RuO 4 super- conductor. We point out, however, that at present we have no evidence in favor of such a scenario."
571,PR05914099-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,27,"In summary, we have performed DC-magnetization and zero-field muon spin rotation (ZF-µSR) measure- ments which characterize the superconducting-and the magnetic properties of the hybrid cuprate-ruthenate compound RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 . The DC-magnetization data establish that this material exhibits ferromagnetic order (or at least magnetic order with a sizeable ferromagnetic component) below T Curie = 133 K and becomes super- conducting at a much lower temperature of T c = 16 K. We obtain evidence that superconducting charge carriers originate from the CuO 2 planes, while the ferromagnetic order is associated with the Ru moments with µ(Ru) ≈ 1 µ B . The larger Gd moments with µ(Gd) ≈ 7.4 µ B do not appear to participate in the ferromagnetic transition but remain paramagnetic to very low temperature and undergo most likely an antiferromagnetic transition at T N =2.6 K. The ZF-µSR experiments provide evidence that the ferromagnetic phase is homogeneous on a mi- croscopic scale and accounts for most of the sample vol- ume. Furthermore, they indicate that the magnetically ordered state is not significantly modified by the onset of superconductivity. This rather surprising result raises the question as to how ferromagnetic and superconduct- ing order can coexist on a microscopic scale while avoid- ing strong pairbreaking effects that tend to destroy su- perconductivity. We have outlined a possible scenario which relies on the two-dimensional charge dynamics of the CuO 2 planes and the assumption that the ferromag- netic order parameter of the Ru-moments is confined to the RuO 2 layers."

Under flowing O2-gas of a high pressure (4 bars), we have succeeded in growing single crystals of x = 0.11 with 5 mm in diameter and 20 mm in length. It has been found that both in-plane and out-of-plane electrical resistivities of the single-crystal La2−xBaxCuO4 with x = 0.11 exhibit a clear jump at ∼ 53 K. The temperature corresponds to the structural phase transition temperature between the orthorhombic mid-temperature (OMT) and tetragonal low-temperature (TLT) phases, T d2 . It has also been found that both in-plane thermoelectric power and Hall coefficient drop rapidly at T d2 and decrease below T d2 with decreasing temperature. These results are quite similar to those observed in the single-crystal La1.6−xNd0.4SrxCuO4 with x ∼ 1/8, suggesting that the so-called static stripe order of holes and spins in the CuO2 plane is formed below T d2 in La2−xBaxCuO4 with x ∼ 1/8 as well as in La1.6−xNd0.4SrxCuO4 with x ∼ 1/8"
574,P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"Since the discovery of the anomalous suppression of superconductivity in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8, the so-called 1/8 anomaly has been a subject of con- siderable research attention. In recent years, the 1/8 anomaly has been found not only in a series of La-214 high-T c superconductors but also in the Bi-2212 and Y-123 ones, which means that the 1/8 anomaly is common to high-T c superconductors in- cluding the CuO 2 plane in their crystal structures. In La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8, the structural phase tran- sition from the orthorhombic mid-temperature (OMT, space group: Bmab) to tetragonal low-temperature (TLT, space group: P4 2 /ncm) phase occurs at ∼ 70 K. Moreover, at low temperatures below the struc- tural phase transition temperature, T d2 , the transport properties exhibit various anomalous behaviors, such as an increase in the electrical resistivity and decreases in the thermoelectric power and the Hall coefficient with decreasing temperature. Therefore, the intimate con- nection between the crystal structure, the electronic state and the suppression of superconductivity has at- tracted notice. Several years ago, a static stripe order of holes and spins in the CuO 2 plane was discov- ered from the elastic neutron-scattering experiment in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 with x = 0.12. The static stripe order is formed as the TLT phase appears. There- fore, they have proposed that the dynamical stripe cor- relations, observed in a wide range of hole concentration in the La-214 superconductors, are pinned by the TLT structure, leading to the appearance of the static stripe order and the suppression of superconductivity."
575,P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,3,"In La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8, such a static stripe order has not yet been found in the neutron scattering experiment because of the difficulty in the preparation of a large-sized single crystal of good quality. However, it is thought that the static stripe order exists also in this system, taking account of the appearance of the TLT phase and transport anomalies below T d2 in the polycrystalline sample which are analogous to those ob- served in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 . Moreover, the observation of a magnetic order of Cu spins in the muon- spin-rotation (µSR) measurements provides a strong cir- cumstantial evidence in favor of spin stripe ordering in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8. Another inter- est in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 is that the effect of the Nd spin in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 on the formation of the static stripe order can be examined. It is because Sakita et al. have pointed out that the behavior of the susceptibility of La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 is quite different from that of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 even above T d2 , which suggests that the Nd moment may have a great influence on the formation of the static stripe order. Accordingly, the prepara- tion of the high-quality single crystals of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8 and the detailed study on the possible stripe order are of much importance. Several attempts to grow single crystals of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 by the traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) method have been reported so far. However, no single crystal of good quality with x ∼ 1/8 has been grown in flowing O 2 -gas of low pressures below ∼ 2 bars. Therefore, we have attempted to grow single crystals of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8 by the TSFZ method in flowing O 2 -gas of high pressures, on the analogy of the successful growth of La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 single crystals.

After pulverization, the prefired materials were mixed and sintered in air at 1100 • C for 24 h. This process of mixing and sintering was repeated 4 times to obtain homogeneous powders of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 . Next, 1 mol % CuO powders were added to the powders of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 and mixed thoroughly, in order to ob- tain tightly sintered feed rods in the sintering process and also to compensate for evaporated CuO in the TSFZ growth process. The obtained fine powders were put into thin-wall rubber tubes and formed into cylindrical rods under a hydrostatic pressure of 2.4 kbars. The typical di- mensions of the rods were 6 mm in diameter and 120 mm in length. In the growth process of La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 , one of the most serious problems is deep penetration of the molten zone into the feed rod, which makes the molten zone unstable. To avoid such a situation, it is impor- tant for the feed rod to be sintered as tightly as pos- sible.

Moreover, the anomalous behaviors are much clearer in the single crystal than in the polycrystal, as in the case of La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 . These results demonstrate that carriers are affected by the structural phase transition at T d2 in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 0.11 as well as in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 with x = 0.12.

591,P064144524-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,19,"In general, signs of the thermoelectric power and the Hall coefficient reflect the sign of carriers. Therefore, it is very likely that the observed sign reversals in the temperature dependences of S ab and R H , as shown in , have the same origin. The sign reversal of S ab in the single-crystal La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 0.11 is very small, compared with that in the polycrystalline La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 1/8. It may be due to the smaller value of x than 1/8 where the sign reversal is the most conspicuous in the polycrystalline La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 . As for the sign reversal of R H , it is often observed in the superconducting fluctuation regime, though it has not yet been understood clearly. It is an empirical fact that the sign reversal of R H has a strong magnetic-field depen- dence in the superconducting fluctuation regime. That is, the magnitude of the sign reversal of R H decreases with increasing magnetic field, accompanied by the broaden- ing of the superconducting transition curve in resistivity. displays the temperature dependence of R H in various magnetic fields, measured using another batch of the single-crystal La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 0.11. It is found that the magnitude of the sign reversal of R H increases with increasing magnetic field and saturates in higher fields above 6 T. Moreover, the sign-reversal tem- perature is independent of the onset temperature of the superconducting transition, T onset c , estimated from the resistivity in each magnetic field. Therefore, it is dif- ficult that the observed reversal in the sign of R H in the single-crystal La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 0.11 is attributed to the superconducting fluctuation. The origin of the sign reversals in S ab and R H is not clarified, but it is consid- ered that these behaviors are characteristic of the 1/8 anomaly in a series of La-214 systems."

We now discuss the experimental results in the single- crystal La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 0.11 from the view point of the static stripe order. The observed anomalous behaviors in ρ ab , ρ c , S ab and R H are quite similar to those observed in La 1.6−x Nd 0.4 Sr x CuO 4 with x ∼ 1/8 where the static stripe order is formed at low temperatures below T d2 . In particular, Noda et al. have suggested in La 1.4−x Nd 0.6 Sr x CuO 4 that the rapid decrease in R H below T d2 is a typical behavior of the one-dimensional transport associated with the formation of the stripe or- der. Therefore, it is much convinced that the static stripe order of holes and spins is formed at low temper- atures below T d2 also in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 0.11, though it has already been predicted from the experi- mental results in the polycrystalline samples.

595,PR05907184-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,1,"The ab-plane optical spectra of two single crystals of underdoped La2−xSrxCuO4 were investigated. The reflectivity of La1.87Sr0.13CuO4 has been measured in the frequency range 30 -9,000 cm −1 (0.004 -1 eV) both parallel and perpendicular to the CuO2 planes, whereas La1.86Sr0.14CuO4 was studied only in the ab-plane. The extended Drude model shows that the frequency-dependent effective scattering rate 1/τ (ω, T ) is strongly suppressed below the high-frequency straight-line ex- trapolation, a signature of the pseudogap state. This suppression can be seen from temperatures below the superconducting transition up to 400 K. In the case of underdoped LSCO the straight-line extrapolation is temperature independent below 200 K, whereas above 200 K there is a strong tem- perature dependence of the high-frequency 1/τ (ω, T ). The out-of-plane direction is also examined for evidence of the pseudogap state."
596,PR05907184-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"The presence of a pseudogap in the normal state of underdoped high temperature superconductors is by now widely accepted. The strongest evidence for the pseu- dogap state comes from recent measurements of an- gle resolved photoemission spectra as well as vac- uum tunneling . However, these techniques both de- mand extremely high surface quality and have therefore mainly been restricted to Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ (Bi221) and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Y123) materials, both with two CuO 2 layers per unit cell. Techniques that probe deeper into the sample such as dc transport , optical conduc- tivity and NMR were not only the earliest to show evidence of the pseudogap but have been extended to a much larger variety of materials, including several materials with one CuO 2 . In all cases evidence for a pseudogap has been reported."
597,PR05907184-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,3,"The pseudogap in LSCO as seen by NMR and neu- tron scattering is rather weak and has led to the suggestion that the existence of the pseudogap in the spin excitation spectrum is only possible in bilayer com- pounds such as Y123 and YBa 2 Cu 4 O 4 (Y124). In par- ticular, Millis and Monien attribute the pseudogap (or the spin gap) to strong antiferromagnetic correlations be- tween the planes in the bilayer, which are responsible for a quantum order-disorder transition. Apart from having only one CuO 2 layer La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) is also a good model system for the study of doping dependences since it can be doped by the addition of strontium over a wide range: from the underdoped, where T c increases with Sr content, to the optimally doped where T c reaches its maximum value of ≈ 40 K at x = 0.17, and to the overdoped region where T c → 0 at x = 0.34. The characteristic signatures of the pseudogap state in the dc resistivity are seen clearly in LSCO . These are the striking deviations below a temperature T * from the high temperature linear resistivity, resulting in a clear break in slope at T * . It was found by B. Batlogg et al. that in LSCO T * decreases from 800 K to ap- proximately 300 K as the doping level is increased from the strongly underdoped to just over the optimal doping level. Similar behavior at T = T * has been observed in the Hall effect coefficient and the magnetic susceptibility. The pseudogap can also be observed if the conductiv- ity is measured in the frequency domain, σ(ω), where it shows up as a striking depression of the frequency depen- dent scattering rate at low frequency. It is found that below a frequency Ω p ≈ 600 cm −1 , the scattering rate drops below its high temperature, high frequency, linear behavior. This effect has been clearly identified in the bilayer materials. One of the aims of this paper is to see if this behavior can also be observed in LSCO. A pseudogap state can be defined in terms of this suppres- sion of scattering: the material is in the pseudogap state when the scattering rate falls below the high frequency straight-line extrapolation. In the low frequency limit the scattering rate is proportional to the dc resistivity. Due to this, the 1/τ (ω,T) suppression should be com- pared to the suppression of ρ DC (T) at temperatures below the linear T dependence region. The IR measure- ment gives us the possibility to see both the frequency and the temperature dependence of this feature."

However, as the doping is reduced further, the c-axis pseudogap state features below 0.1 eV become clearer.

In both Fig. and Fig. one can see the temperature evolution of the sharp depression in ab-conductivity below 700 cm −1 at temperatures above T c . A much clearer picture of the pseudogap state can be seen from the effective scattering rate, 1/τ (ω,T), cal- culated from the conductivity using equation (1) which is shown along with the effective mass in Fig. and Fig. . The 1/τ (ω,T) spectra can conveniently be divided into two regions. In the high frequency region, starting at about 700 cm −1 , the scattering rate varies linearly with frequency while in the low frequency region there is a clear suppression of 1/τ (ω,T) below this linear trend. The temperature where this suppression first appears serves as a definition of T * , the onset temperature of the pseudogap state. As the temperature is lowered below T * this suppression becomes deeper. We find that for under- doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 T * ≥ 400 K, an order of magnitude higher than the superconducting transition temperature T c (32 K). This is significantly different from previous results on cuprates where T * more or less coincides with T c near optimal doping."
620,PR05907184-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,26,"The temperature dependence above 700 cm −1 is strongly influenced by the level of Sr doping. In the underdoped sample the high frequency scattering rate is nearly temperature independent up to a certain tem- perature (Fig. and Fig. ), which we will call T * * above which a pronounced temperature dependence of 1/τ (ω,T) is seen (Fig. and Fig. ). In the x = 0.13 sample T * * ≈ 200 K while in the x = 0.14 sample T * * ≈ 150 K. In the overdoped samples the scattering rate above 700 cm −1 increases uniformly with temper- ature at all temperatures suggesting T * * → 0 in that limit. This behavior is also seen in other overdoped HTSC. If one extrapolates the 300 K scattering rates to zero frequency one finds that for the x = 0.13 sample the scattering rate 1/τ 0 ≈ 2500 cm −1 and for the x = 0.13 sample this rate is ≈ 1500 cm −1 . These scattering rates are much higher than what is seen for the higher T c ma- terials reviewed by Puchkov et al. where at 300 K 1/τ 0 ≈ 1000 ± 200 cm −1 for several families and many doping levels. This high residual scattering differentiates the LSCO material from the other cuprates."
621,PR05907184-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,27,"If we call the frequency below which the scattering rate is suppressed the ab-plane pseudogap ω ab ≈ 700 cm −1 we find it is clearly bigger than the c-axis pseudogap frequency ω c ≈ 500 cm −1 In addition to the pseudogap depth and temperature dependence, several other features of Figures should be mentioned. The position of the pseudogap re- mains at 700 cm −1 for all temperatures. There are also several peaks positioned at 500 cm −1 in the scattering rate which complicate the analysis, particularly in the case of the sample with x = 0.14. These peaks have been observed by other groups and have been attributed to po- laronic effects. Another possible explanation is the correlation of the ab-plane conductivity with c-axis LO phonons. We did observe the difference in contribution of LO phonons to the ab plane reflectance with different propagation directions, an effect first observed by Reedyk et al., and also seen in the k c vs. k ⊥ c spectra ob- tained by Tanner's group. In Fig. the reflectance with E a and k c, is compared with the reflectance with E ab and k a, with the La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 sample at room temperature. There is an extra feature observed at 500 cm −1 in the spectra with k c. Further evidence that the c-axis LO phonons couples to ab plane features can be seen in Fig. . The comparison between peaks in the effective scattering rate at 450 cm −1 and 580 cm −1 to the peaks in Im(-1/ǫ c ) shows the same strong correlation seen in many other cuprates. For completeness we also plot the effective mass of un- derdoped samples at low temperatures(Fig. ) and high temperatures(Fig. ). As expected, m * (ω) me rises to a maximum ≈ 3 forming a peak at ≈ 400 cm −1 . The en- hancement of the effective mass in the pseudogap state as well as the upper limit of m * (ω) me are similar to what has been previously reported for Y123, Y124 and Bi2212. Before closing we compare our results with data of Gao et al. on La 2−x Sr x CuO 4+δ films and Quijada et al. on oxygen doped La 2 CuO 4+δ . Our results in the un- derdoped case are comparable with those of the oxygen doped material, although Quijada et al. did not carry out a frequency dependent scattering rate analysis for their underdoped sample. The film results of Gao et al. are quite different from our findings. The films used in that study had a strontium level that would correspond to optimal doping in crystals. However, the 1/τ (ω) curves deviate markedly from what we observe for slightly under and overdoped samples. The authors performed an ex- tended Drude analysis and found a strongly temperature dependent scattering rate even at low temperatures. This is in sharp contrast to our results which would suggest a very weak temperature dependence in this tempera- ture region. Based on our work, their samples should be in the pseudogap state since they have an x value near optimal doping. Comparing these results with other sys- tems, in particular with Tl2202, two factors suggest the possibility that the films may be overdoped. First, their T c was near 30 K, lower than that expected for optimal doping. Secondly, it is known that the oxygen level in films can vary substantially and in LSCO oxygen can have a major influence on the doping level . On the other hand, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that all the crystal results are affected by the polishing process, and that the films better represent the bulk ma- terial. It is clearly important to measure films where the oxygen content is controlled by selective annealing."

624,PR05907184-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,30,"The scattering rate is similar for both systems in the pseudogap state. At low frequencies, ω ≤ 700 cm −1 , the scattering rates are temperature dependent and change with frequency in a non-linear fashion. Above 700 cm −1 this behavior becomes linear. Within experimental un- certainty the observed high frequency scattering rate of the underdoped sample is not affected by temperature up to certain temperature T * * . This temperature is equal to 200 K in case of La 1.87 Sr 0.13 CuO 4 and 150 K in case of La 1.86 Sr 0.14 CuO 4. Above T * * the high frequency scat- tering rate is temperature dependent. This behavior is identical to the high-frequency effective scattering rate of an overdoped HTSC. Our findings in the direction perpendicular to the CuO 2 planes showed that the depression of the c-axis conductivity is not as prominent as the one found in the two layer HTSC. Nevertheless, the signature of the pseu- dogap can be seen at the frequencies below 500 cm −1 up to room temperature."

628,PR06006991-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"The peculiar normal-state properties of high-T c cuprates are generally considered to be the keys to elu- cidate the high-T c mechanism, since they give us a clue to clarify the nature of the strongly-correlated electronic state of the cuprates. To understand the underlying elec- tronic state of the cuprates, it is desirable to study the normal state at low temperatures and to chase the systematic evolution thereof with carrier concentration . Therefore, particularly useful system for the normal- state study is such a system where T c is relatively low and where the the carrier concentration can be changed in a wide range from underdope to overdope."
629,PR06006991-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,3,"A typical study in which a wide temperature window for the normal-state is desirable is the measurement of the temperature dependence of the scattering time. For example, the observation of the T -linear resistivity from 10 K to 700 K in Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6 (Bi-2201) had a strong impact, because it clearly demonstrated the dominance of the electron-electron interaction in the scattering mecha- nism. In high-T c cuprates, it has been discussed that the charge transport is governed by two different scattering times with different temperature dependences ; ac- cording to this ""two-scattering-time"" model, in-plane re- sistivity ρ ab is governed by the transport scattering time τ tr (∼T −1 ) and the Hall angle θ H is governed by the ""Hall scattering time"" τ H (∼T −2 ). However, this idea of ""scattering-time separation"" has not yet gained a com- plete consensus and there are other approaches to un- derstand the unusual normal-state transport properties . Therefore, it would be useful to establish the tem- perature and doping range in which the T 2 behavior of the Hall scattering rate τ −1 H is observed. There are two widely-known cuprate systems which satisfy the requirements of the relatively low T c and the availability of a wide doping range; La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) system and Bi-2201 system. Bi-2201 has not been as intensively studied as LSCO, mostly because of the difficulty in obtaining high-quality single crystals. A number of problems have been known for Bi-2201 crys- tals: (a) the transport properties of B-2201 are quite non-reproducible even among crystals of nominally the same composition ; (b) the residual resistivity of the in-plane resistivity ρ ab is usually large (the smallest value reported to date is 70 µΩcm ), as opposed to LSCO, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO), or Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 (Bi- 2212), where the residual resistivity in high-quality crys- tals is negligibly small; and (c) the temperature de- pendence of the Hall coefficient is weak and thus the Hall angle θ H does not obey the T 2 law , while θ H ∼ T 2 has been almost universally observed in other cuprates . On the other hand, the Bi-2201 system has very attractive characteristics: it has been known for Bi-2201 that the carrier concentration can be widely changed by partially replacing Sr with La (to under- dope) or Bi with Pb (to overdope) ; at optimum dop- ing (Bi 2 Sr 2−x La x CuO 6 with x≃0.4), the maximum T c is about 30 K , which is lower than the maximum T c of LSCO. Therefore, if single crystals of sufficiently high quality are grown, this system would present an ideal stage for the systematic study of the normal-state prop- erties down to lower temperatures than in other cuprates."
630,PR06006991-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,4,"In this Letter, we report that it is possible to obtain a series of high-quality Bi-2201 crystals and show that in those high-quality crystals the normal-state transport properties display behaviors which are in good accord with other cuprates; for example, in the underdoped re- gion, ρ ab shows a downward deviation from the T -linear behavior at a certain temperature which decreases with increasing doping and, in the overdoped region, T depen- dence of ρ ab changes to T n with n >1. What is new in this system is that the Hall angle indeed obeys a power law T α with α≃2, but the power α shows a systematic decrease towards smaller values as the carrier concentra- tion is increased. This finding of a systematic change of α in a relatively-simple single-layer cuprate system poses a serious question to the universality of the ""Fermi-liquid like"" T 2 behavior of the Hall scattering rate τ −1 H . An- other notable finding is that the ratio of the longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) to the transverse MR increases systematically with decreasing carrier concentration, in- dicating that a spin contribution to the MR gradually becomes significant as the sample becomes more under- doped."

It is known that pure Bi-2201 is an overdoped system . Since the La substitution to the Sr site reduces the number of holes, increasing La doping brings the system from overdoped region to underdoped region. We found that the La substitution results in a growth of crystals of better morphology compared to the pure Bi-2201. The actual La concentrations in the crys- tals are determined by the inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP) technique. Here we report crystals with x=0.24, 0.30, 0.44, 0.57, and 0.66, for which the zero-resistance T c is 24, 30, 33, 28.5, and 20 K, respec- tively.

To our knowledge, this optimum T c is the highest value ever reported for Bi- 2201 or BSLCO system. The ICP analysis found that our crystals are Bi-deficient by about 0.2, while Sr+La is almost stoichiometric; for example, the x=0.44 sample has the composition of Bi 1.8 Sr 1.57 La 0.44 CuO 6+δ."

The underdoped samples (x=0.57 and 0.66) show a rather complex temperature dependence in ρ ab , which is similar to that of underdoped YBCO ; the behavior in underdoped YBCO is characterized by a downward deviation from the T -linear dependence and the presence of a maximum in dρ ab /dT . Such a behavior has been cor- related to the opening of a pseudogap . The broad maximum in dρ ab /dT moves to higher temperature as the carrier concentration is decreased, which agrees with the conjecture that the pseudogap opens at higher temper- ature in more underdoped samples. On the other hand, the slope dρ ab /dT of the overdoped samples (x=0.30 and 0.24) monotonically decreases with decreasing tempera- ture. This reflects the fact that ρ ab of the overdoped samples behaves as ρ ab =ρ 0 + AT n with n larger than 1, a behavior reported in the overdoped samples of LSCO and Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ (Tl-2201) . The inset to Fig. shows that ρ ab (T ) for x=0.30 and 0.24 can actually be described by the power law with n=1.14 and 1.27, respec- tively.

Figure shows the temperature dependence of R H for the five samples. A clear evolution of R H with x is ob- served; the change in the magnitude of R H at 300 K sug- gests that the carrier concentration is actually reduced roughly by a factor of 3 upon increasing x from 0.24 to 0.66. Figure shows the plot of cot θ H (=ρ xx /ρ xy ) vs T 2 . Only the data for x=0.66 can be fitted with a straight line in this plot, indicating that the T 2 law of cot θ H holds only in this most underdoped sample.

Firstly, we found that the classical Kohler's rule ∆ρ/ρ∼(H/ρ) 2 is strongly violated, as in other cuprates . We also found that the ""modified Kohler's rule"" ∆ρ/ρ∼(cot θ H ) −2 is not very well applicable to our data; this is different from the results for LSCO and YBCO and might be related to the fact that cot θ H does not behave as T 2 except for the x=0.66 sample.

In particular, τ −1 H shows a tendency that the power α becomes systemati- cally smaller with increasing doping in the whole doping range studied. This observation, combined with the sys- tematic change of the longitudinal MR, might suggest that the T 2 law of τ −1 H is observable only when the spin contribution to the charge transport is strong. This in turn suggests that in Bi-2201 the role of spin degrees of freedom is already weakened at optimum doping, which might be the reason for the relatively low T c of this sys- tem. Interestingly, another single-layer cuprate Tl-2201 shows a good T 2 dependence of τ −1 H at optimum dop- ing and Tl-2201 has the maximum T c of 85 K.

We will see later that at 5 K the optical conductivity reveals a metallic Drude- type of behavior. In addition we carefully analyzed the resistivity upturn for x = 0.2 and T < 50 K in terms of a Kondo-like increase or hopping conductivity of localized charge carriers. Both models do not provide a reason- able description of the low-temperature upturn.

Certainly the fit of Eq. 1 to χ(T ) is not convincing at high temperatures. This is due to the fact that for T > 100 K χ(T ) slightly increases on increasing temperature. It is this behav- ior which led Neumeier et al. to add a term which is linear in T . It is worth to mention that the data can be well fitted in the complete range up to room temperature employing this additional linear term χ cor T without hav- ing significant influence on the results for the parameters χ Pauli , µ ef f , and Θ. An alternative interpretation for the deviation from Pauli behavior at elevated temperatures rests on the as- sumption that for T > 100 K Sr 2 Ru 1−x Ti x O 4 behaves like a 2D antiferromagnet with a large exchange con- stant. In these systems the exchange corresponds to a maximum in the susceptibility which then would be ex- pected at T > 400 K and thereby the increasing suscepti- bility with increasing temperature can be well described."

T m is in agreement with the phase diagram published by Minakata and Maeno 26 , which shows a saturation of T m for Ti concentration x > 0.12. The fact that for x = 0.1 and 0.2 the char- acteristic temperatures T m are almost the same could in- dicate slight deviations of the effective Ti concentration from the nominal composition. One is tempted to assume spin-glass like ordering of statistically substituted local 3d 1 states embedded in a Fermi-liquid of the band states. However, the FC and ZFC cycles were performed at relatively high fields of 10 kOe. At such high fields spin-glass effects often are suppressed . The FC and ZFC splitting can also in- dicate the formation of FM clusters or even true long- range ferromagnetism were the FC and ZFC splitting result from domain-wall effects in strongly anisotropic materials. Having the time dependence of magnetiza- tion in mind, which has been observed by Minakata and Maeno , it seems most plausible to assume short-range FM correlations only. We also would like to stress that magnetization for fields within the ab-plane is not af- fected at all and for low temperatures the zero-field curve with H c is well below M with H a, b.

The crystals show an anisotropic behavior of dc resistivity and infrared reflectivity similar to that ob- served in undoped Sr 2 RuO 4 , but the temperature de- pendence of dc resistivity is rather different. The resis- tivity along c reveals a semiconducting behavior down to the lowest temperatures and the resistivity within the RuO 2 -planes signals the onset of localization effects close to 50 K. From the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization we conclude that the crystals exhibit an anisotropic Curie-Weiss behavior at temperatures be- low 100 K. Moreover magnetic ordering along c with a moment of order 0.01 µ B /f.u. evolves at T < 15 K. At the moment it is unclear if long-range or short- range magnetism is established below T m . However it is clear that strong AFM exchange dominates the in-plane properties while FM coupling between the planes estab-lishes FM correlations along c. Antiferromagnetic or-der within the planes corresponds to spin arrangements observed in La 2 CuO 4 and La 2 NiO 4 and also were de- tected in Ca 2 RuO 4 (Ref. . We also speculate that even at elevated temperatures the Ti-doped Ruthenates behave like two-dimensional magnets similar to what has been observed in Sr-doped La 2 CuO 4 (Ref. ). High- temperature susceptibility measurements, even in the pure compound are highly warranted. From the heat capacity experiments we find that the Sommerfeld co- efficient significantly becomes suppressed on Ti-doping reaching values of 27 mJ mol −1 K −2 for x = 0.1 and 23 mJ mol −1 K −2 for x = 0.2, which still are extremely high values for a bad metal close to localization with a low density of charge carriers. Carrying out the heat ca- pacity in a broader temperature range, we find that just below the magnetic ordering transition the susceptibility becomes considerably enhanced and at low temperatures possibly soft magnetic excitations dominate the heat ca- pacity. However, at the magnetic ordering temperature, as observed in the susceptibility experiments, no heat ca- pacity anomalies indicative for long-range magnetic order were detected. This can be interpreted as an additional evidence that only short-range order exists below T m . It is interesting to note that the heat capacity for T > 1 K remains unchanged in fields as high as 140 kOe."

Note that the oppo- site conclusion was derived for the Na111 series, such as NaFe 1−x Co x As 10 . In the Na111 series, T c follows AF fluctuations when pressure is applied. At first sight, the results of the Na111 series seem to contradict the results reported herein. One may classify the La1111 series as an exotic and exceptional compound among iron-based pnictides. However, all facts including the La1111 and Na111 series are consistent if the superconductivity is not directly affected by antiferromagnetism or AF fluc- tuations. For all iron-based pnictides without exception, 1/T 1 T becomes stronger as the doping level approaches the AF-phase boundary, but the T c optimal doping level is not always located on the AF-phase boundary and de- pends on the compounds, which causes an apparent dis- crepancy."
685,1609.04957-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,12,"Roughly speaking, T c is proportional to the DOS and the paring interaction. The enhancement of the paring interaction is hardly expected for the AF-fluctuation- mediated scenario. As another candidate, the orbital- fluctuation-mediated scenario would be promising. In this case, orbital fluctuations are difficult to observe in 1/T 1 T at a doping level where the structural or nematic phase is absent, and thus the increase in T c is observable via the DOS alone in 1/T 1 T . To investigate whether the paring interaction is enhanced simultaneously as well as the DOS, further theoretical investigations are needed; however, the results of (b) would give an impor- tant clue."
686,1609.04957-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,13,"One may consider another scenario where the pair- ing interaction originates from AF fluctuations, but AF fluctuations are suppressed at ambient pressure by some competing interactions such as orbital and/or charge in- teractions. On the basis of this scenario, T c could be suppressed and the double-dome structure could be ob- served as observed in some high-T c cuprates. Pressure could nullify the competition, and T c may increase un- der pressure even if AF fluctuations are not enhanced. However, the competing orders, which could cause ap- preciable suppression of T c , have not been observed so far in a wide range around x = 0.14 − 0.20. Furthermore, AF fluctuations tend to decrease by applying pressure as observed in the poorly F-doped regime or sufficiently H-doped regime [See Fig. 1(c)]. At present, there is no experimental evidence to support this scenario."

For x = 0.44 (near the second AF-phase boundary), T c remains unchanged without depending on the magnitude of AF fluctuations. These results suggest that the super- conductivity has no direct connection with AF fluctua- tions. So far as the results of 1/T 1 T are concerned, the increase in T c up to 48 K originates from an enhancement of the DOS just above T c."

695,L092157004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,2,"Sodium cobalt oxide, Na x CoO 2 (x ≈ 0.65 to 0.75), has received considerable attention due to its unusual thermal electric properties. Recent studies have re- vealed anomalous non-Fermi liquid behavior in trans- port properties which point to the importance of strong correlations. The cobalt ions form a hexagonal lay- ered structure and the formally 1−x fraction is in the low spin (S = 1 2 ) Co 4+ state, while the x fraction is in the S = 0 Co 3+ state. Interest in this material escalated with the discovery of superconductivity by Takada et al.in Na x CoO 2 • yH 2 O when the sodium concentration is re- duced to about 0.3 and water is intercalated between the layers. The ability to control the sodium content is an exciting development because, in principle, the limit of x = 0 corresponds to a Mott insulator on a triangular lattice with S = 1 2 . Then the hydrated compound can be viewed as electron doping of a Mott insulator with a doping concentration x ≈ 0.3. As such, it is the second known example of superconductivity arising from dop- ing a Mott insulator after the high T c cuprates. The S = 1 2 antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice was in fact the starting point of Anderson's resonating valence bond (RVB) idea,and the new superconductor has been in- terpreted in this light. Until recently, the bulk properties of superconducting Na 0.3 CoO 2 • 1.3H 2 O has been studied mostly using pow- der samples. Single crystal measure- ments are much less plentiful, though such measure- ments are extremely important in order to understand this anisotropic layered compound. In this paper we re- port a new electrochemical method to extract Na from Na x CoO 2 . This is an alternative to the chemical de- intercalation of Na using Br ions introduced by Takada et al. Our electrochemical method permits precise con- trol of the Na content and avoids the environmental haz- ards associated with the use of high molar concentra- tions of Br. In addition, we have succeeded in growing large single crystals of Na x CoO 2 by the floating zone (FZ) method. By applying the electrochemical procedure to the FZ crystals, we have obtained superconducting single crystal samples with which we have carried out a variety of physical property measurements."
696,L092157004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,3,"The initial Na 0.75 CoO 2 polycrystalline material was prepared using Na 2 CO 3 and Co 3 O 4 with Na to Co ratio at 0.75 to 1. The thoroughly mixed and ground powder was calcined at 750C for 12 hours and then reacted at 850C for 24 hours with frequent grindings in between. Na loss was minimized with a fast-heating method. A stoichiometric Na 0.75 CoO 2 feed rod was melted and re-crystallized with an optical floating-zone furnace (4-Xe lamp design, CSI Japan) under oxygen atmosphere. Although Na vapor loss was observed from the white de- posit on the walls of the quartz sample chamber, this loss was minimized by choosing a fast pulling rate. A stable molten zone can be maintained with various pulling rates from 1.5 to 10 mm/hr. Electron probe microscopy anal- ysis (EPMA) indicates the FZ crystal has Na content between 0.71 and 0.74 for a crystal pulled with 2 mm/hr rate. We have grown large single crystals of Na 0.75 CoO 2 (5mm diameter × 8 cm long) successfully with this FZ method. Powder neutron diffraction confirms that the Na level of the FZ crystal is essentially identical to that in the feed rod. A three-electrode electrochemical cell was set up using the Na x CoO 2 sample as a working electrode, platinum foil as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference elec- trode (E 0 = +0.222 V vs. the standard hydrogen elec- trode), and 1M NaOH as an electrolyte.

Hydrated Na 0.3 CoO 2 • yH 2 O can be prepared by having the sam- ple anodically polarized with a constant voltage (0.6-1.2 V) until the decaying anodic current reaches a constant value. Alternatively, a constant current (of 0.1-10 mA) can be used to achieve the same charge level by wait- ing until the final open circuit potential reaches ∼ 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Samples obtained directly from the cell are typically in a mixture of the partially hydrated (c ≃ 13.8Å) and fully hydrated (c ≃ 19.7Å) structures and show only trace amounts of superconductivity. Fully hydrated superconducting crystals can be achieved by sealing the sample in a water vapor saturated container at room temperature. We find that the rate of hydration depends on grain size and several months are required to fully hydrate mm-sized single crystals. The sodium content in each sample was checked by electron probe microanalysis. After electrochemical treatment, our as- prepared floating-zone single crystals with x = 0.75 typ- ically break apart into smaller crystals (∼5×5×2 mm) with x ≃ 0.28 − 0.32."

A plateau in the OCP corresponds to two-phase coexistence. We can identify three prominent plateaus in .

700,L092157004-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,7,"Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and resistivity have been measured on our superconducting single crys- tal samples. As shown in , the susceptibility shows a large anisotropy, similar to that reported for Na 0.68 CoO 2 . However, the Curie-Weiss susceptibility that is so prominent there is now absent. The small cusp at 42 K is likely due to a Co 3 O 4 impurity phase, which is known to have an antiferromagnetic transition in the 33 to 46 K range. By comparing the size the magne- tization cusp with that for bulk Co 3 O 4 , we estimate that the Co 3 O 4 impurity fraction of our sample is small, at the 1% level. However, we cannot detect the existence of Co 3 O 4 within our x-ray diffraction sensitivity. Apart from this anomaly and the low temperature Curie tail (which arises from only 0.5% of the Co moments), the susceptibility is nearly temperature independent. Note the large magnitude and strong anisotropy. For compar- ison, the magnitude is about 5 times that of lanthanum strontium cuprate (La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 ) and 30 times that of a simple metal like Na. The anisotropy is probably due to a combination of anisotropy in the g factor and the van Vleck term. AC susceptibility measurements were taken in a field of 3 Gauss/100 Hz as shown in the inset of . The diamagnetic signal is indicative of a su- perconducting phase with an onset temperature of about 4.2 K, and the screening fraction is estimated to be about 120% (without geometric correction)."

The sample had been hydrated for three months after electrochemical de-intercalation, and x-ray diffraction indicates that 94% of the sample consists of the fully hydrated superconducting structure. In zero field, a pronounced peak is observed at 4.2 K, indicating the transition to bulk superconductivity. A second broad peak exists at lower temperature around 1.5 K. In a field of 1 T, the superconducting anomaly at 4.2 K is strongly suppressed; in contrast, the peak at 1.5 K is slightly en- hanced. This suggests that the peak around 1.5 K is not related to a second superconducting phase with a lower T c. Such a peak may be compatible with a model of weakly interacting localized Co moments, analogous to the effects seen in impurity-doped semiconductors. In fields larger than 5 T, both peaks disappear and are re- placed by a broad enhancement of C/T over a wide range of temperatures. With increasing field, the enhancement of C/T shifts to higher temperatures. In the inset of , the top panel compares the sup- pression of the superconducting anomaly for H c and H ab. In order to achieve a comparable suppression, an in-plane field with magnitude 5 times that of the the out-of-plane field is required. This reflects the anisotropy of H c2 in the different field orientations and is consistent with our resistivity measurements of H c2 (discussed be- low). We note that ∆C/T c in zero-field for our single crystal sample is comparable to that reported by other groups in powder samples.  The data plotted in the main part of exhibit an upturn at the lowest measured temperatures which increases with increasing field. This is most likely due to a Schottky contribution from the nuclear spins. The bottom panel of the inset shows C/T data at high-fields in which a nuclear Schot- tky contribution (6.7×10 −6 B 2 /T 2 ) has been subtracted. These data demonstrate that in fields greater than ∼10 T superconductivity is completely suppressed. Hence, 10 T may be taken as an upper limit for H c2 with H ab."

A better way is to extract a bandwidth which we estimate to be 1.4 eV. Even though the LDA calculation was done for x = 0.5 and without hydration, the bandwidth should be insensitive to these differences. On the other hand, we can fit the observed DOS to that of the free electron tight binding band on a triangular lattice with hopping matrix element t ef f . With t ef f < 0 and x = 0.35, the tight binding DOS for both spins is 0.16/|t ef f |. The measured DOS then implies that |t ef f | ≈ 23 meV, or a full bandwidth of 9|t ef f | ≈ 0.2 eV, which is a factor of 7 smaller than the LDA bandwith. We therefore conclude that there is a mass enhancement of ∼ 7 compared with band theory. By assuming g = 2, we find that the measured χ c of 3.5 × 10 −4 cm 3 /Co-mole corresponds to a free elec- tron DOS of 10.86 states/eV. This gives a Wilson ra- tio 4π 2 k 2 /3(gµ B ) 2 χ/γ of 1.53.

The conductance per square at low T of each layer is 50 (e 2 /h), indicative of a long mean free path. The current and voltage leads were attached with silver paste which was allowed to dry in at- mosphere for 12 hours.

In , we plot H c2 vs. T for both field orientations. There is about a factor of 5 difference in the slopes near T c , con- sistent with the heat capacity data. The value of H c2 for H ab is consistent with the Pauli paramagnetic limit for pair breaking. From the H c2 vs. T curve for H c, we determine a coherence length of ξ ≈ 100Å. This rela- tively short coherence length is surprising for a supercon- ductor with such a low T c, but is entirely consistent with the narrow bandwidth. Assuming a parabolic band, the BCS formula for ξ o can be expressed in terms of the DOS ρ(ǫ F ) in the following way: ξ o = vF π∆o = √ 3kF a 2 2π 2 ρ(ǫF )∆o .

Indeed, many observations, including a fast sup- pression of the Néel order by doped holes which results in the ""spin-glass"" state , and a strong tendency to form spin-charge textures -""stripes"" , point to a very strong coupling between the charge and spin degrees of freedom."

Apparently, if the charge transport and spin correlations are actually de- coupled in the electron-doped cuprates, the SC pairing should have a non-magnetic origin as well.

The three-dimensional or- dering [] that sets in below the Néel temperature T N = 250 − 285 K is governed by weak pseu- dodipolar (PD) interactions, which favor a noncollinear orientation of spins in adjacent planes (alternating along the [100] and [010] directions) .

Note that while these diagonal directions are hard spin axes in the non-collinear phase, they become the easy axes in the collinear one. A perfectly aligned field B [010] causes a first-order transition directly to the spin-flop phase [], while at intermediate field directions the magnetic field first induces a transition into the collinear phase [], and then smoothly rotates the spins to align them perpendicular to the field ."

The reduced T N is probably due to a partial substitution of Pr 3+ with non-magnetic La 3+ , as well as to doped electrons. Similar to PCO , the Pr 3+ ions in PLCCO can be polarized by the ordered Cu 2+ moment. Upon cooling below 100-150 K, the exchange field of the Cu 2+ spins induces a small (up to ∼ 0.1 µ B ) ordered moment"

Indeed, for the collinear spin arrangement [], the magnetic in- tensity vanishes at (1/2, 1/2, L) with L = 1, 3, 5.

In contrast to hole-doped cuprates , the doping of 1% of electrons into the CuO 2 planes appears to be insufficient to induce metallic in-plane conduction in PLCCO, and both ρ ab and ρ c grow upon cooling below room temperature []. It is worth noting also that lightly doped PLCCO turns out to be one of the most anisotropic cuprates with ρ c /ρ ab ∼ 8000 at room temperature -an order of mag- nitude larger than in LSCO and YBCO."

At a first glance, this supports the view that the charge motion in electron-doped PLCCO is virtually decoupled from spin correlations, and one therefore would expect the conduc- tivity to ignore the spin reorientation sketched in . Surprisingly, the experiment shows that this is not the case, and instead of being field-independent, both ρ ab and ρ c exhibit a considerable increase upon transi- tion into the collinear state []. We have confirmed that this MR is of the spin origin and contains no orbital terms, since no difference was ob- served in ∆ρ ab /ρ ab for fields applied parallel or perpen- dicular to the current. Moreover, ∆ρ ab /ρ ab and ∆ρ c /ρ c demonstrate a remarkable similarity both in magnitude and in field dependence, in spite of the huge resistivity anisotropy. Finally, no MR anomaly is observed when a c-axis aligned field is applied, consistent with the absence of a spin-flop transition for such field orientation ."

First is the sign of the anomalous MR, which is always positive in PLCCO, but negative in LSCO. Sec- ond, the MR features in LSCO and YBCO become dis- cernible as soon as the AF order is established, but in PLCCO they appear at temperatures much lower that T N (at T < 70 − 100 K), and quickly gain strength upon decreasing temperature . The latter indicates that some other factors, such as magnetic moments of Pr 3+ or a structural instability , that come into play at low temperature, may be relevant to the observed MR."

One can see that the charge transport ignores the initial spin rotation, and the steep- est resistivity variation is observed at B c , where the collinear structure is established. Although B c changes substantially with temperature [], the apparent shift in the transitions holds consistently, with the peak in dρ/dB roughly coinciding with the end of the transi- tion observed by neutron scattering."

Regardless of the field direc- tion within the ab plane, the resistivity exhibits roughly the same increase at the spin-flop transition, but then (at B > B * c ) it keeps changing without any sign of satura- tion [Figs. 5(b) and 5(c)]. Even more surprising is that this high-field MR changes its sign depending on the field direction, as is schematically drawn in the inset to . One can conceive a spin structure upon rotating the high magnetic field within the ab plane in the follow- ing way: the spins always keep the collinear arrangement and rotate as a whole, being almost perpendicular to the magnetic field . Our data show that the resistiv- ity goes down as the spin direction approaches one of the two equivalent spin easy axes (Cu-Cu directions) and in- creases at the spin hard axes (Cu-O-Cu directions) [inset to ]. Note that the resistivity changes are rather large, ∆ρ ab /ρ ab reaches ≈ 18% at T = 5 K and exceeds 32% at 2.5 K, indicating that the magnetic field B [100] can effectively localize the doped electrons."
733,L092227003-CC.superconductors.tei.xml,19,"Apparently, the fascinating MR oscillations in cannot originate from simple ""spin-valve"" effects, since at high fields the spin structure always stays collinear, and all that changes is the relative orientation of spins with respect to the crystal axes.

Though the exact mechanism of the revealed MR features still remains to be understood, what is certain is that the charge carriers in electron-doped cuprates appear to have a remarkably strong coupling with the spin order, which should play an important role in determining their physical properties."
