Nitride halides MNX (M = Zr, Hf; X = Cl, Br, I) are insulators that contain hexagonal X(MN) 2 X layers which may be stacked in several polymorphic arrangements .Chemical or electrochemical intercalation of alkali metals (Li, Na, K) into the van der Waals gaps between these layers, or removal of a small amount of halogen X, dopes electrons into the M d-band inducing superconductivity . T c = 25.5 K has thus been achieved for Li 0.48 (THF) y HfNCl containing cointercalated tetrahydrofuran solvent (THF) (see ) . The intercalated MNX phases are very air-sensitive which has hampered study of their physical properties.   Superconductivity with maximum T c = 16.3 K has recently been reported in A x TiNCl (A = Li, Na, K, Rb) , where the constituent layers have an orthorhombic structure that differs from that of the Zr and Hf based materials.This reveals that superconductivity is not specific to one underlying lattice symmetry in this family.Physical measurements show that the nitride halides are not conventional BCS superconductors ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In silicon carbide bulk T c up to 1.4 K was achieved by doping with ~ 1 at % boron .For silicon thin films a novel Gas Immersion Laser Doping technique allows to increase the boron doping concentration homogenously up to 11 at %, far beyond the solubility limit of boron in silicon .   In spite of the modest T c of only up to 0.7 K the compatibility of this preparation technique with common silicon thin film technology is promising with respect to a link of superconducting and semiconducting electronics .  For yttrium carbide compounds T c as high as 18 K was reported.Superconductivity in a graphite intercalation compound was first observed in 1965 on KC 8 which exhibits very low critical temperature T c = 0.14 K .  Later, several ternary graphite intercalation compounds revealed higher T c of 1.4 K for KHgC 8 and 2.7 K for KTl 1.5 C 4 . Recently, the discovery of high critical temperatures in graphite intercalation compounds YbC 6 (T c =6.5K), CaC 6 (T c =11.5 K) and Li 3 Ca 2 C 6 (T c = 11.15 K) has renewed the interest in this family of materials .  For graphene, the atomic monolayer modification of graphite, Li-or Ca-decoration is now been reported to induce superconductivity up to T c ~ 6 K Fullerides are metal-doped fullerenes.   Compounds of the form A 3 C 60 can become SC at surprizingly high temperatures .By now, a number of SC fullerides based on the admixture of alkali atoms or of alkaline earth atoms are known.Rb 3 C 60 has a value of T c of 29.5 K, the present record under pressure is held by Cs 3 C 60 with T c = 40 K.The crystal structure of the fullerides is face centered cubic, with the alkali atoms occupying interstitial sites between the large C 60 molecules.Fullerides are BCS-like s-wave superconductors.Intramolecular C 60 phonons (see ) seem to contribute the most important part of the pairing interactions .However, for body-centered cubic A15-structured Cs 3 C 60 (which is not SC at ambient pressure) an apparantly purely electronic transition to a SC state with T c up to 38 K can be induced by pressure, where the T c dependence on pressure can not be described by BCS theory in terms of the induced changes of anion packing density ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The application of pressure changes the inter-atomic distance and modify the electronic and the phononic energy spectra of a solid without introducing any chemical complexity and keeping the physical complexity to a minimum. This is particularly so when the pressure is hydrostatic and the solid is isotropic. Therefore, high pressure techniques have been extensively used in recent years to explore the physical states of solids, to create new ground states in solids, to test theoretical models and to help develop new theories. For example, there are more naturally nonsuperconducting elements that have been turned into superconductors through the application of pressure in the last half-century than naturally occurring elemental superconductors . It was the high pressure experiments on the A15 compound system to examine the correlation between superconductivity and lattice instabilities in the late 1970's and early 1980's that gave us the confidence that superconductivity could take place at temperatures above 30's K , in contrast to the then theoretical prediction . Again, it was the high pressure experiments on cuprates that demonstrated that indeed a superconducting transition temperature (T c ) could be achieved above 50's K and suggested that the cuprate system warranted further exploration for novel physics and higher T c, besides providing hints for the search for T c > 50's K .  In fact, the current record-T c of 164 K was achieved in HgBa 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 9+\u03b4 (Hg1223) with an ambient T c of 134 K only under a pressure ~ 30 GPa."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The parent compound of undoped La1111 displays a layered structure of the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs type of space group P4/nmm ).  It consists of two layered substructures, namely, the alternating FeAs-layers and the LaO-layers.Each FeAs-layer is composed of a Fe-sheet sandwiched by two As-sheets with the Fe-atoms tetrahedrally coordinated to four As-atoms. Each LaO-layer consists of an O-sheet sandwiched between two La-sheets. FeAs-layers may be expected to form the active block for the charge carriers to flow, and the LaO-layers constitute the charge reservoir blocks that inject charge carriers into the active block to maintain the maximum layer-integrity of the FeAs-layers, as in the cuprate HTSs. It is a semimetal and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at T o ~ 150 K and becomes superconducting when charge carriers are introduced via electron-doping by partial substitution of O by F when T o is suppressed to 0 K.  The report of superconductivity in electron-doped LaOFeAs has attracted great attention worldwide for three main reasons among others: 1) it is a new material system with a relatively high T c ; 2) it belongs to a layered transition-element-pnictide material class that is comprised of a large number of compounds and thus gives great possibilities in the search for higher T c ; and 3) it contains a large concentration of the magnetic Fe, which is antithetic to superconductivity, and thus provides an avenue to examine the role of magnetism in high temperature superconductivity (HTS). It is therefore rather natural to hope that what high pressure has done to cuprate HTS can be repeated in Fe-pnictide superconductors in raising the T c .   In the ensuing months, many other superconducting Fe-pnictides have been discovered. They are grouped into four homologous series, 1111 (ROFeAs with R = rare-earth; AeFFeAs with Ae = alkaline earth), 122 (AeFe 2 As 2 ; AFe 2 As 2 with A = alkaline), 111 (AFeAs) and 011 (FeSe).When properly doped, the maximum T c 's are ~ 55 K for 1111 , ~ 38 K for 122 , and 12-25 K for 111 , and ~ 9-14 K for 011 , respectively.Many high pressure experiments have been conducted and theoretical models proposed on these compounds.We shall first briefly review the results and discuss their implications here before presenting the details and discussions according to the different homologous series in later sections."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The reasonably high rate of T c -enhancement by pressure of +1.2 K/GPa coupled with the rapid T c -rise to 55 K by replacement of La observed in electron-doped La1111 by rare-earth elements of smaller ionic radii gave scientists the optimism that a miracle similar to that for cuprate HTS was in the offing and the significant role of magnetism in HTS was about to unravel.   Given the similarities between the Fe-pnictide and cuprate superconductors, the doping (x) dependence of the pressure effect on the T c of electron- doped Sm1111 (SmOFeAs) was soon investigated after the discovery . Pressure was found to enhance T c for samples in the underdoped region, i.e. dT c /dx > 0; to suppress T c for samples in the overdoped region where dT c /dx < x; and to affect T c only slightly for the optimally doped sample, very different from the case of Hg1223 .The observations suggest that the maximum T c of the R1111 may not exceed 50's K and that the lower-than-50's K observed then in R1111 may rise to the 50's K should the sample conditions be optimized. Unfortunately, the highest T c observed in superconducting Fe-pnictides to date has not exceeded 55 K, although the then lower-than-50 K-T c was raised to above 50 K.  Pressure was also found to suppress the magnetic transition temperature T o , consistent with the positive pressure effect on T c of the underdoped samples and with the doping effect on T o .Later, more high pressure experiments were made on the R1111 phase compounds .They demonstrated the close relationship between magnetism and superconductivity, the ability to raise the T c of close to optimally doped R1111 up to 45 K rapidly below ~ 5 GPa followed by a slow T c -drop at higher pressures and the possibility to induce superconductivity in the undoped parent R1111 with a rapid T c up to ~ 25 K."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Sr122 and Ba122 are semi- metals, and possess alternating FeAs-layers and antiferromagnetic transitions at ~ 200 K and 140 K , respectively, coinciding with a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition, similar to R1111. They become superconducting and form a new homologous series of AeFe 2 As 2 (Ae122 with Ae = alkaline-earth elements) when hole-doped by partial replacement of Ae with alkaline elements = A .The large solubility range of (Sr 1-x K x )122 make easy the formation of the full T c -x phase diagram and thus enables the systematic study of the x- dependence of the pressure dependence on T c .    Indeed, it was found that dT c /dP > 0 for the hole-doped Sr122 samples in the region where dT c /dx > 0; whereas dT c /dP <0 for samples in the region where dT c /dx < 0, similar to the observation on the electron-doped Sm1111 .

Above 0.8 GPa, T c seems to saturate or, possibly, decrease toward higher pressure. This tendency of T c , passing through a maximum with increasing pressure, has been confirmed for other underdoped R(O 1-x F x )FeAs compounds [16]. The observations can be summarized as: for electron doped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs, dT c /dP > 0 when dT c /dx > 0 in the underdoped region and dT c /dP < 0 when dT c /dx < 0 in the overdoped region, similar to the HTS cuprates as far as the signs are concerned [47].   This implies that the main effect of pressure is to promote electron-doping in Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs, while it generates holes for the HTS cuprates. It should be noted that the suppression of the SDW transition observed should also contribute to the positive dT c /dP of the underdoped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs.By referring back to the quadratic universal T c (x) relation for the hole-doped cuprates by Presland et al. , we have proposed a possible upper T c -limit < 50's K for the R1111 FeAs-superconductors, independent of the R in R1111 and suggested to look for higher T c in the FeAs-layered compounds with more complex structures than that of the R1111 series . It was later shown theoretically by Nekrasov et al. that R is indeed electronically isolated from the conducting electrons and plays no role in the superconductivity of Fe-pnictides.Unfortunately, our predicted upper T c-limit remains valid to date; however, we hope the latter prediction will bear fruit soon."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

They investigated the pressure effects on the resistivity \u03c1 of the optimally electron- doped (with an x where dT c /dx ~ 0) and the electron-underdoped (in a region where dT c /dx < 0) La(O 1-x F x )FeAs with x = 0.11 and 0.05. Their ambient onset T c 's are 28 K and 9 K for the x = 0.11 and 0.05 samples, respectively. The pressure was generated in a BeCu piston-cylinder cell up to 3 GPa hydrostatically and up to 30 GPa in a diamond anvil cell quasi-hydrostatically.   The \u03c1(T)'s of the x = 0.11 and 0.05 samples are shown in Figs. 5a and b at different pressures. The onset-T c of the x = 0.11 sample, as defined in Fig. 5a, increases steeply from 28 K to 43 K with pressure up to 3 GPa at a large initial rate dT c /dP ~ + 8 K/GPa and then drops off slowly to 9 K at 30 GPa at a rate dT c /dP ~ -1.4 K/GPa as shown in Fig. 6.The onset-T c of the sample of x = 0.05 was also found to increase with pressure but at a slower rate of + 2.0 K/GPa below 3 GPa where the experiment stops (Fig. 7 and inset). The experiment did show that the T c of La(O 1- x F x )FeAs with F-doping can be raised to a maximum of 43 K by the joint effects of chemical (F- doping) and pressure doping.     The authors further pointed out that a large number of existing transition-metal-oxypnictes with a structure similar to LaOFeAs [7] may offer great opportunities for seeking superconductors of higher T c by proper doping.   The experiment also shows the sensitivity of \u03c1 and the superconducting transition of La(O 1-x F x )FeAs to non- hydrostatic pressure effects as evident in Figs. 5a and b where \u03c1(T)'s at different pressures are displayed.Pressure inhomogeneity tends to broaden the superconducting transition and remove the zero-\u03c1 state, making it difficult to define the onset T c at high pressure.This was further demonstrated later in the study of 122 Fe-pnictides where hydrostaticity may have a bearing on the nature of superconductivity induced by pressure as was observed decades ago in \u03b1-uranium.It should be noted that Fratini et al. suggested that internal chemical pressure may simulate the externally applied pressure effect on T c by analyzing and comparing the structural transitions of the undoped LaOFeAs and NdOFeAs.Later Wang et al. carried out an iso-valent-doping experiment on LaOFe(As 1-x P x ) by partial replacement of As by P.Their XRD results show a reduction in volume as x increases.They found that LaOFe(As 1-x P x ) become superconducting with T c reaching 10.5 K at x = 0.4.Unfortunately, a higher T c was not realized."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

A zero dT c /dP is expected from the standard universal T c (x)-relation.Such a prediction is true only when the rigid band model is true, i.e. the T c (x)-relation is not altered by pressure in terms of the maximum T c and the optimal x where T c reaches its maximum.

In other words, pressure changes the carrier concentration and the band simultaneously.Therefore, the positive dT c /dP for an optimally-doped La(O 1-x F x )FeAs is understood in terms of this modified T c (x)-model.However, the asymmetrical T c -peak with respect to pressure is less obvious and whether it is a characteristic of the Fe-pnicitides is unclear."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The results are summarized in Fig. 8. Similar to their previous work on the x = 0.11 sample, all display rapid T c -increase followed by a slower T c -drop above ~ 5 GPa to 30 GPa and the rate is the highest of 8 K/GPa for the optimally doped sample.They also witnessed the undoped LaOFeAs to become superconducting at pressures above ~ 2 GPa.

The data indicate that the nearly constant maximum T c close to the optimal doping at ambient pressure and the general nonlinear overall T c -P behavior are consistent with the modified T c (x)-model discussed above.In the same study, Takahashi et al. found that the T c of LaOFeP with an ambient pressure value of T c = 5.8 K rises steeply to 8.8 K at 1 GPa and then drops rapidly to ~ 7 K with further increasing pressure, similar to the LaOFeAs. The crystal structure of these samples was also studied by XRD at room temperature under pressures up to 10 GPa.    They found a bulk modulus of ~ 70 GPa, similar to the cuprates, and a reduction in anisotropy by pressure but no pressure-induced structural change.  Zocco et al. [19] found a qualitatively similar T c (P)-behavior of La(O 1-x F x )FeAs with a more rapid drop of T c at high pressure.   However, they found an exception of a continuous decrease of T c with pressure for the optimally doped Ce(O 1-x F x )FeAs (Fig. 9), showing that R in R1111 may play a role in their T c - response to pressure, although there may still be uncertainty in the exact doping level.More examples with such behavior of negative effect on T c from low to high pressure were found, for instance, by Takeshita et al. [23] in another study on oxygen-deficient NdO 1-y FeAs.Garbarino et al. [18] measured the pressure effects on the T c and the lattice parameters of the optimally doped La(O 1-x F x )FeAs.They found that T c decreases linearly with pressure up to ~ 20 GPa.Yi et al. [20] reported the similar dependence of T c on pressure for the nominally optimal-doped and overdoped La(O 1-x F x )FeAs.However, the exact values of x cited may be questionable in view of their relative T c 's.Okada et al. [22] measured the T o and T c of undoped LOFeAs and found that both coexist in a wide range of pressures of ~ 1 -13 GPa.From the above reports, it is clear that the pressure effect on the T c of R1111 depends on R, the pressure hydrostaticity, and the doping level.The effect of pressure hydrostaticity above 2-3 GPa cannot be neglected and the uncertainty associated with the latter is large due to the complexity in sample preparation and characterization."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The large solubility range of (Sr 1-x K x )Fe 2 As 2 makes it possible to form a complete T c -x phase diagram at ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12 where T o represents the SDW transition temperature. The maximum T c = 38 K takes place at x ~ 0.4 -0.5.    Possible coexistence of SDW and the superconducting states is apparent between x ~ 0.2 and 0.3.The phase diagram makes possible the systematic study of the x-dependence of the pressure coefficient of T c of the 122 series. It should be noted that this was the first complete T c (x)-phase diagram of Fe-pnictides available at the time.We have, therefore, measured \u03c1(T) and \u03c7 ac (T) under hydrostatic pressures up to 1.7 GPa, for different x's to cover the three major regions of hole-doping [10, 15, 29].  The T c (P) for samples with x = 0.2 (underdoped), 0.4 (~ optimally-doped) and 0.7 (overdoped) are given in Fig. 13.   It is unambiguously shown that dT c /dP is positive for the underdoped sample, close to zero for the optimally doped sample and negative for the overdoped sample, in agreement with the prediction of the universal T c (x)- relation proposed for the hole-doped cuprate HTSs as discussed in section 2.1.The observation can be summarized as: dT c /dP > 0 in the region where dT c /dx > 0; dT c /dP ~ 0 where dT c /dx ~ 0; and dT c /dP < 0 where dT c /dx < 0, suggesting that pressure promotes holes.The pressure study on electron-doped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs suggests that pressure generates electrons.Based on these two studies, one may conclude that symmetry between the electron-and hole-dopings exists in Fe- pnictide superconductors, in agreement with the earlier observation by Wen et al. .It should be noted that pressure suppresses the SDW transition in the hole-doped (Sr 1-x K x )Fe 2 As 2 ), just as in the electron-doped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Superconductivity was detected only near the T-cT transition in the hysteretic area. A question concerning its nature was raised. The loss of magnetism was attributed to the depletion of the Fe 3d density of states at the Fermi surface as was suggested by band-calculations. Yu et al. [31] performed a careful magnetic susceptibility experiment under hydrostatic pressure conditions using He as the pressure medium and they detected no sign of superconductivity. They therefore concluded that neither the O nor the cT-phase is superconducting. They further attributed the occasional observations of superconductivity near the T-cT transition to possible intermediate phases generated by non- hydrostatic pressure conditions in domain walls of phase separated regions arising from the large anisotropic change crossing the O-cT transition line. Pratt et al. [43] recently did an inelastic neutron scattering study on CaFe 2 As 2 under hydrostatic pressures and found the antiferromagnetic fluctuations in all three phases are suppressed or quenched completely in the cT-phase within the experimental resolution.

This method can be used to determine the critical temperatures T c either for the extended \u2212 s wave or d wave symmetry. We can also describe the pressure effects on T c by introducing the assumption that it induces a change in the magnitude V of the attractive potential. This assumption yields an explanation for the intrinsic term, and together with the well known change in n h , we set the critical temperature as T c = T c (n h (P ), V (P ).

Thus, we can see that the constants c 1 and c 2 are determined by how V and n h changes with the pressure (Eq (). Hall effects can give directly \u2202n h /\u2202P as in the case of Bi2212 and therefore c 2 .  Since these measurements are not available for the T l 0.5 P b 0.5 Sr 2 Ca 1\u2212x Y x Cu 2 O 7, we can obtain c 1 and c 2 by comparing with the curves of T c \u00d7 P for two values of n h . In fact Wijngaarden et al. also esti- mate the value of c 2 from their experimental data for the T l 0.5 P b 0.5 Sr 2 Ca 1\u2212x Y x Cu 2 O 7. Since at low pressures only the linear term comes into play, the higher order coefficients can be ignored.  Thus, \u03b1 1 becomes the slope of a linear approxi- mation from the initial points of the T c \u00d7 P curve, for a given n h compound.Starting with n h =n op , in spite of not being strictly necessary, we determine c 1 using the estimated \u03b1 1 in Eq., as long as at n op the charge transfer term vanishes. To determine c 2 we estimate \u03b1 1 from the T c \u00d7P curve of an n h = n op compound, and use again Eq. Once these two constants are determined, the \u03b1 z coefficients for any n h value can be calculated (Eq. For the T l 0.5 P b 0. 5 Sr 2 Ca 1\u2212x Y x Cu 2 O 7 series we used the experimental values for the n h = n op = 0.15 and n h =0.20 compounds to calculate c 1 and c 2 . The estimated \u03b1 1 were 1.5K/GP a and 0.41K/GP a for n op and n h =0.20, respectively.  The phase diagram parameters ( \u2206Tc \u2206V ) taken from Fig. 1 and 2 and used in the calculations were 2900K/eV for the extended \u2212 s wave and 2300K/eV for the d wave symmetry for the n op compound and 2700K/eV for the extended \u2212 s wave and 2600K/eV for the d wave symmetry for the n h =0.20 compound. The parameters of the parabolic curve (Eq.19) used were \u03b2 = 3.5 and T max c =105.1K. Therefore, the resulting constants were c s 1 = 5.17\u00d7 10 \u22124 eV /GP a and c s 2 = 6.7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 GP a \u22121 for the extended \u2212 s wave and c d 1 = 6.52 \u00d7 10 \u22124 eV /GP a and c d 2 = 8.7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 GP a \u22121 for the d wave symmetry.  On Fig. we present our results in comparison with the experimental data. One observes that, for the optimum doping, and the compounds near the optimum doping, we have a rather good result.For the optimum com- pound (n h =0.15) in particular, we had the better result, for both symmetries, with very good agreement with the experimental data .For n h =0.075, 0.20 and 0.25 we can reproduce well the low temperature data and obtain a qualitative agreement on the high pressure region."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In under- doped YBCO, the in-plane resistivity \u03c1 ab shows a clear downward deviation from the T -linear behavior below a temperature T * , which has been discussed to mark the onset of the pseudogap .

Inset: Plot of R hyp H vs T for the three samples, see text. The measurements are performed with a low-frequency (16 Hz) ac technique. Longitudinal and transverse volt- ages are measured simultaneously using two lock-in am- plifiers during the field sweeps at constant temperatures. For the transverse signal, we achieved a high sensitivity by subtracting the offset voltage at zero field (the offset comes from a slight longitudinal misalignment between the two Hall voltage contacts). The temperature is stabi- lized using a high-resolution resistance bridge with a Cer- nox resistance thermometer. We confined the maximum magnetic field to 4 T, with which the error of the Cer- nox thermometer caused by its own magnetoresistance is negligibly small in the temperature range of the present study. The magnetic field is applied along the c-axis of the crystals. To enhance the temperature stability, the sample and the thermometer are placed in a vacuum can with a weak thermal link to the outside. The achieved stability in temperature during the field sweeps is better than a few mK. The data are taken from \u22124 T to +4 T, and then the asymmetrical component is calculated to obtain the true Hall voltage.

Our results are somewhat different from previous results on single crystals , but rather resemble that of the thin film result . Notably, R H around 250 K does not change with z, while the peak at 110 K is clearly suppressed with increasing Zn concentra- tion. Still, the behavior of cot \u03b8 H is in good agreement with the previous studies; as is shown in Fig. , cot \u03b8 H changes approximately as T 2 in a rather wide range, and the Zn impurities add a T -independent offset which is roughly proportional to z. We note that the Zn-doping effect on R H (T ) ob- served here is naturally expected in the context of the two scattering time scenario. One can infer that the primary effect of Zn-doping is to add some constant impurity-scattering rates to both \u03c4 \u22121 tr and \u03c4 \u22121 H , because both \u03c1 ab (T ) and cot \u03b8 H (T ) show essentially parallel shifts upon Zn-doping. Since one can approximately express \u03c4 \u22121 tr \u223cT and \u03c4 \u22121 H \u223cT 2 in pure samples, the scattering rates in Zn-doped samples can be approximated as H is approximately written as R H \u223c (T + A)/(T 2 + B) in Zn-doped samples.  If we compare this expression with that for the pure samples, R pure H \u223c T /T 2 \u223c T \u22121 , we can infer that at high temper- atures R H in Zn-doped sample should approach R pure H , while at low temperatures R H in Zn-doped sample is ex- pected to become smaller than R pure H (which can be eas- ily seen when one considers T \u21920). The above heuristic argument implies that the weakening of the T depen- dence of R H (T ), combined with a z-independent room- temperature R H , is a rather natural consequence of the Zn-doping in the two scattering time scenario, although this effect has not been well documented before.  Now let us analyze the data in more detail in regard of the T dependence of cot \u03b8 H .A close examination of Fig. tells us that the data for z=0 and 0.006 are slightly curved in this plot; we found that the best power laws to describe the data in a wide temperature range are T 1.85 , T 1.9 , and T 2.0 , for z=0, 0.006, and 0.013, respectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For this purpose, it is instructive to see how R H (T ) would behave if cot \u03b8 H continues to change as T \u03b1 down to T c . The inset to Fig. shows the plots of the T dependence of such hypothetical R hyp H for the three samples, where R hyp H is calculated by dividing \u03c1 ab by (C + DT \u03b1 ) \u00d7 H, where D is the T -independent value at temperatures above T 0 in Fig. . It is clear from the behavior of R hyp H that R H (T ) would not show a peak if cot \u03b8 H continues to change as T \u03b1 down to T c .  Therefore, we can conclude that the peak in R H (T ) in underdoped YBCO is caused by the opening of the pseudogap."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For exam- ple, in overdoped Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+\u03b4 (Tl-2201), it has been reported that cot \u03b8 H shows a good T 2 dependence down to near T c (which implies that the pseudogap does not open), and yet the peak in R H (T ) is observed at a temperature well above T c .  In this case, the peak in R H (T ) is just a result of the two different T depen- dences of \u03c4 \u22121 tr \u223c T n + A (1\u2264n\u22641.9) and \u03c4 \u22121 H \u223c T 2 + B (note that in Tl-2201 both \u03c4 \u22121 tr and \u03c4 \u22121 H have somewhat large offsets even in pure crystals ). Mathematically, R H \u223c (T n + A)/(T 2 + B) has a peaked T -dependence and thus R H (T ) can show a peak well above T c for some combination of A and B, even when both \u03c1 ab and cot \u03b8 H do not show any deviation from the power laws.  On the other hand, as is demonstrated in the inset to Fig. , the peak in R H (T ) of underdoped YBCO cannot be ac- counted for by the above origin and therefore is clearly caused by the pseudogap.This argument tells us that one should always look at the T dependence of cot \u03b8 H , not just the peak in R H (T ), to determine whether the pseudogap is showing up through (\u03c9 c \u03c4 H ) \u22121 ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The onset temperature T 0 for this deviation, which is found to be unaffected by Zn doping, is close to the lower temper- ature scale for the pseudogap T g (probed by the Cu NMR relaxation rate, for example). The fact that cot \u03b8 H tends to be enhanced below T 0 suggests that the effect of the pseudogap is not to reduce the Hall scattering rate; we therefore propose that the effect is more likely to be origi- nating from a change in the Fermi surface topology, which causes a change in the effective mass. Also, we demon- strated that the peak in R H (T ) of underdoped YBCO is not just a result of two different scattering times, but is actually a result of the pseudogap effect on cot \u03b8 H ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This type of tetrahedral network is called the pyrochlore lattice, and has been studied extensively in order to elucidate the effect of geometrical frustration on the properties of localized spin and itinerant electron systems. Recently, superconductivity was found in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 (Re 5+ : 5d 2 ) at T c = 1 K for the first time in the family of pyrochlore oxides. 2-4) The mechanism of the superconductivity appears to be conventional, and may be understood in the framework of the weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. 5) Very recently, we have discovered a new pyrochlore oxide KOs 2 O 6 which exhibits superconductivity at 9.6 K. 6) Our preliminary structural analysis indicates that it crystallizes in a cubic structure with space group m Fd3 , as in the ideal pyrochlore oxides, but with K atoms located at the O' site of the ideal pyrochlore structure.     It is known that the pyrochlore structure sometimes tolerates vacancies at the A and O' sites.

If they are related, the pseudogap might be associated with the presence of electronic pairs above T c . From this point of view, superconductivity occurs when the phase of these pairs becomes coherent and not when they are first formed in the phase incoherent state . T he idea of a precursory pair formation at relatively high temperatures T c < T < T * and its relevance for high T c superconductivity is supported by the experimental observation that the pseudogap evolves into the superconducting gap at low temperatures, as clearly demonstrated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy . Moreover, the ARPES data indicate that the pseudo-and the superconducting gap both have d-wave symmetry. T he fact that the T *(p)-and the T c (p)-lines merge in the overdoped regime , with p the hole density, may explain the difficulty to observe a pseudogap in the strongly overdoped case.

Although La 1.8 Sr 0.2 CuO 4 and La 1.75 Sr 0.25 CuO 4 reveal distinct pseudogap features, they partially recover a 2D (or 3D) character.

T his evolution suggests that the effect can be attributed to superconducting fluctuations. T he fluctuations appear at temperatures, which exceed T c by several times.  It is therefore reasonable to speak about precursory pairing far above T c .By presenting the magnetoresistivity data in the form of classical Kohler-plots, we found that the superconducting fluctuations are very pronounced in underdoped samples.  At the same time, the normal-state contribution to the magnetoresistivity dominates in overdoped samples. T he region, where we observed superconducting fluctuations, is schematically shown in the phase diagram of by the shaded area. In order to evaluate this region exactly, an adequate theory is needed, which allows to separate fluctuations and normal-state contributions to conductivity. Unfortunately, such theory is lacking at the moment. It is however clear from our data that there is a close link between the presence of strong superconducting fluctuations and the pseudogap phase. Since fluctuations are expected to become more pronounced in systems with a reduced dimensionality, this observation is in excellent agreement with the idea that the pseudogap phase is characterized by 1D charge transport . T he excess conductivity of the La 1.94 Sr 0.06 CuO 4 (T c = 2.4 K) and La 1.9 Sr 0.1 CuO 4 (T c = 17.5 K) sample at 50 T indeed shows a simple power-law behavior with respect to the temperature. T he experimentally found power 1.54 is close to 3/2, which is characteristic for one-dimensional fluctuations, according to the basic theory of paraconductivity, proposed by Aslamasov and Larkin .Hence, our findings strongly favor stripe models and are consistent with the idea of a precursory behavior towards superconductivity far above T c."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Furthermore, extracting and inserting the sample gives the value of \u2206f 0 already reduced by finite \u03bb(0). Other methods of estima- tion of \u2206f 0 such as measuring a ball made of a conven- tional superconductor or replicating an HTSC sample using low-T c material 3 result even in greater uncertainty, because in addition to an inevitable \"static\" uncertainty between different runs there are additional uncertainties related to differences between real sample and the sub- stitute. Furthermore, realistic samples are irregular and so have dimensions which are uncertain to much more than \u03bb(T ). They may also have large demagnetizing ef- fects. Finally Eq. (1) itself involves approximations for R that adds further error. It is therefore not feasible to measure \u03bb(T ) using resonator frequency shifts in the straightforward manner outlined. Despite this limitation on accuracy, the precision with which changes in \u03bb can be measured is much higher. This is illustrated in by the change \u2206f upon warming the sample from low to intermediate temperature. In this case the sample stays fixed so the temperature-independent static uncertainty is irrelevant.

Essentially all other experimental results agree with this view. The developing situation in the electron-doped cuprates is not so clear.

We have already demonstrated that low-T quadratic fits are unacceptably poor. Even if one believes that the low-temperature data are quadratic in T , there is no sign of a crossover to linear behavior , and the extrapolated low-T quadratics go to zero well above T c , so the curvature is too weak to be compatible with a dirty d -wave interpretation .

These off-stoichiometric regions usually have a characteristic length of a few hundred \u00b5m or smaller and a very similar structure to SnSb , and thus are difficult to distinguish by the XRD measurements.

Moreover, the initial diamagnetic signal in the susceptibility data could also be due to these regions.

It is prudent to note that SnSb is not a line compound , and hence rapid quench is necessary to retain the phase to room temperature.  During this process, it is expected that the grain surface cools faster than the interior, which leads to the development of strain at the grain boundaries. This may result in the increase of density of states and/or phonon softening, and consequently an enhanced T c . Note that the grain boundaries constitute a small fraction of the sample, yet they are connected to form a continuous superconducting path, as observed experimentally. In this respect, high pressure study and epitaxial film growth of SnSb, which may favor a higher T c, will be of interest in future."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Despite their different crystal structures, the \u03b3 n and \u0398 D values are very similar for these compounds. Nevertheless, compared with SnAs, SnSb has a much lower T c and a smaller \u03bb ph .  Actually, this is also the case when one compares the experimental results of SnSb with the theoretically predicted ones assuming the same crystal structure as SnAs . This implies that, within the BCS framework, the lower T c value of SnSb in the rombohedral structure compared with that in the rock-salt structure is due to a decrease in the electron phonon coupling strength.However, it is noted that the electronic band structure of SnAs measured by ARPES is not in full agreement with the calculated one, but bears signatures of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) .  As for SnSb, the SOC effect is expected to be even stronger, and hence the possibility of odd-parity pairing cannot be excluded.In this regard, to better understand the SC in SnSb, a combined theoretical and spectroscopic study of its band structure and Fermi surface is strongly called for."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

It is further shown that the material a bulk type-II superconductor below 1.50 K with a BCS-like gap. Nevertheless, the zero resistivity transition takes place at a considerably higher temperature of 2.48 K, for which two possibilities are discussed.   One possibility is that this is due to the presence of inhomogeneous regions with off stoichiometric Sn/Sb compositions due to the micro-phase segregation.Another possible scenario in that the enhanced T c in resistivity measurement results from the strain effect that develops at the grain boundaries during the sample quenching. We also compare the properties of SnSb with those of the rock-salt structure SnAs superconductor, which suggests that the lower T c in SnSb is likely due to a weakening of the electron phonon coupling strength.Since SnSb can be regarded as a close relative to the topological semimetal Sb, further band structure calculations and surface-sensitive spectroscopic studies are called for to assess the potential of this material as a topological superconductor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

A superconducting transition is observed with an onset temperature (T SC ) of about 0.6 K.

This removed 5% of the sample mass, corresponding to a surface layer 5 \u00b5m thick. shows the resistivity measured after etching: the super- conducting transition has been removed.The sample was then spark-cut along its length to give two pieces, each having one spark-eroded surface.

These results were obtained with the voltage contacts on the spark-eroded surface, but identical be- havior was observed when the experiment was repeated on another sample with the same treatment history and voltage contacts were placed on the etched surface oppo- site to the spark-eroded one.On this occasion, Cu wire was used as the spark-cutter electrode so contamination from the wire is excluded as a cause of surface supercon- ductivity.The disappearance of superconductivity af- ter etching and its subsequent reappearance after spark- cutting was reproduced in another sample.In well etched samples no sign of superconductivity was observed at the lowest current density measured J = 675 Am \u22122 and the lowest temperature T = 45 mK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The results for the spark- cut surface show that the composition varies as a func- tion of position but that it is always Zn-depleted, and that it includes regions that are close to Zr 2 Zn in com- position. Atomic concentrations shown in are normalized to 100% but we note that no significant con- taminant peaks are present in any of the spectra used to produce these results. For each sample spectrum two different composition estimates were obtained, the first using only the Zr-L\u03b1 and Zn-K\u03b1 peaks and the second using Zr-L\u03b1 and Zn-L\u03b1. The presence of two character- istic Zn X-ray peaks of very different energy provides a check on our correction procedure because the correction factor is much larger for Zn-L\u03b1 than for Zn-K\u03b1. The excellent agreement between the two estimates for the polished surface shows that the correction procedure pro-vides accurate results in this ideal geometry. The small discrepancy (at the 1% atomic concentration level) may arise, for example, from the correction model used or from a slight tilt of the sample surface relative to the electron beam. Importantly, the results for the spark-cut surface obtained using the different Zn peaks are also in good agreement. The discrepancy is larger than in the case of the polished surface due to the effects of surface roughness on the X-ray intensity corrections. However, it is still small compared to the dramatic Zn depletion observed.

T c at this field is about 2.8K as is seen from the inset of .  The T dependence of T \u22121 1 is shown in . The spin gap is observed even under high pressure as an activated T de- pendence of T \u22121 1 at temperatures higher than 30K, i.e., The value of \u2206 spin is estimated to be 173K. It should be noted that the spin gap is seen in the state in which the charge transport is metallic . By contrast, T \u22121 1 below 30K is dominated by a term showing T -linear dependence followed by a peak devel- oped below T c . The onset and the position of the peak shift to higher temperature with decreasing the magnetic field to 5.0T (open squares in ). If the T -linear component originates from extrinsic source, it should be persistent in the superconducting state. However, T \u22121 1 measured at low temperatures obviously goes below the T -linear line shown in the figure. Then, such a case is excluded. As for the peak the possibility of vortex mo- tion might be pointed out. The vortex motion has been observed from T \u22121 1 of ligand sites in high-T c cuprates such as YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 or HgBa 2 CuO 4+\u03b4 when the H is applied perpendicular to the plane.   The FL is self-trapped between the planes for the H parallel to the plane, and thus the effect is hardly expected in the present case.In fact, the effect disappears when the H is applied parallel to the planes in HBCO system . Fur- thermore, T \u22121 1 /\u03b3 2 N (\u03b3 N : nuclear gyromagnetic ratio ) at the peak is 80 or 25 times larger than those for YBCO or HBCO, respectively. The value is too large to explain the peak due to vortex motion.   Hence, we conclude that the peak of T \u22121 1 and the T -linear component have the same origin in the electric state and/or spin fluctuations.The peak can be assigned to a superconducting coherence peak and the T -linear dependence of T \u22121 1 to Korringa- type behavior, where the value of b is about 6.1 (sec \u22121 K \u22121 ).The ob- servation of the clear peak implies that a finite gap ex- ists in the quasi-particle excitation at all wave vectors.In the meaning that there exist no nodes in the pairing symmetry, the superconductivity possesses a s-wavelike character."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

As a result, an intriguing phase competition between the stripe phase and the superconducting phase appears around a critical composition of x = 0.16 which appears as a bicritical point.

The measurements were made under a magnetic field of H= 10 Oe by warming up the sample after zero field cooling. constant which gives rise to the in-plane expansion and the out-of-plane compression. This strong dependence of T c on anisotropic pressure was also directly demon- strated by a recent uniaxial pressure measurement . Our observation of distinct differences between the in- plane and the out-of-plane pressure effects agrees well with these observations. The most remarkable result here is the substantial dif- ference between the [100] direction and the [110] direc- tion, both within the CuO 2 plane. This is the first obser- vation of an in-plane anisotropic pressure effect in high-T c cuprates.  Only when the pressure is applied along [110] do we see a strikingly large increase of T c with in- creasing pressure.  Indeed, the application of only several kbar causes T c to almost double. In contrast, when the pressure is applied along [100], only a small change in T c is observed.This implies that the in-plane pressure effect cannot be simply described by a superposition of pressure effects along two orthogonal directions but strongly de- pends on the symmetry of strains induced.  This novel anisotropic pressure effect is visually summarized in Fig- ure.Note that the increase of T c with P/[110] upon pressure, dT c /dP [110] \u223c 2.5 K/kbar is even larger than observed on La 2\u2212x Ba x CuO 4 around x \u223c 1/8 with hy- drostatic pressure , previously the largest pressure effect ever observed in high-T c cuprates."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The presence of a universal critical angle for switching was also demonstrated. The tilting angle decreases upon Sr doping and, eventually at the critical angle, drives the stripe magnet into SC. The strain, at 45 degrees to the stripe direction [100] or [010], very likely reduces the LTT tilting angle because of the symmetry mismatch. This decrease of the tilt- ing angle will shift the phase boundary between stripes formation and superconductivity to lower x and will sub- stantially enhance T c of the sample in the critical region.

First, by checking for this anisotropy, we may identify the contribution from the stripes and particularly dynamical stripes to supercon- ductivity itself.  Indeed, uniaxial pressure measurements are now under progress on samples with Sr content x away from the critical composition x = 0.16, in order to explore the influence of dynamical stripes. Second, using [110] pressure, we should be able to switch the stripe magnet to a superconductor using relatively low pressures of a few kbars, if the sample is located at the stripe side of the critical region. We indeed observed such a stripe magnet to superconductor transition at 1 kbar in a nonsupercon- ducting La 1.65 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.15 CuO 4, which has a marginally smaller Sr content than the samples shown in Figures.

We can obtain direct access under pressure to important FS parameters through the measurement of the upper critical field H c2 (T ). Indeed, since the seminal work of Hohenberg and Werthammer , it is known that the orbital limitation of H c2 (T ) is mainly controlled by the Fermi velocity v F . As a consequence, H c2 (T ) can appreciably deviate from the usual (almost parabolic) behavior in clean superconductors when the various sheets of the FS have different electron phonon coupling parameters and Fermi velocities. In such a case, an eventually complex FS can often be modelled by just two bands, allowing to extract the main anisotropies in \u03bb and v F from H c2 (T ) . In a previous article we have measured the pressure evolution of the critical temperature T c and upper critical field H c2 (T ) of two topical superconductors, MgB 2 , and the nickel borocarbide YNi 2 B 2 C, and obtained the pressure induced changes on \u03bb and v F using such an effective two band model .

Indeed, assuming bands with a roughly quadratical dispersion, the Fermi veloci- ties are related to their radius in k-space.The eventual closing of a gap results in an increase of the area of the relevant FS, as already observed in the compound YNi 2 B 2 C, where the behavior of H c2 (T ) under pressure evidences a strong increase of v F in the strong coupling bands, related to the disappearance of a FS nesting feature under pressure .On the other hand, in the case of MgB 2 , the observed decrease in v F,1 under pressure is related to a continuous shrinking of the strong coupling sheets under pressure due to the reduction of their hole doping, achieved at zero pressure through its ionic layered character ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For example, in many layered high T c superconductors, a close relationship is found between the doping dependence of T c and of T * , the pseudogap critical temperature (in hole doped as well as in electron doped materials, see e.g. ). In the Ce heavy fermion systems under pressure , a maximum appears in T c at the same pressure where the Neel temperature is suppressed, demonstrating the implications of the softening of magnetic modes in the formation of superconducting correlations.   In the case of 2H-NbSe 2 , it would be also tempting to interpret the peak in \u03bb 1 in terms of some kind of mode softening near the suppression of the CDW order.However, we can equally argue that the increase in \u03bb 1 when T CDW decreases is related to an increase of the density of states due to the pressure induced suppression of the CDW gap.In that case, clearly, the CDW ground state would be in strong competition with superconductivity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Many experiments have provided evidence (NMR , angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) , specific heat , electron-tunneling spectroscopy and STM ) for a gap-like structure in electronic excitation spectra. There is a consensus on that the pseudogap is a characteristic feature of the underdoped regime of copper-oxides, and the value of T* increases with the decrease of hole concentration.  For example, in tunneling measurements on underdoped Bi2212 single crystals by STM, the pseudogap was detected even at room temperature . At the same time, tunneling measurements showed that the pseudogap is also present in slightly overdoped samples as well .An advantage of tunneling spectroscopy is that it is particularly sensitive to the density of state (DOS) near the Fermi level E F and, thus, is capable of detecting any gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum at E F . In addition to this, tunneling spectroscopy has a high energy resolution ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

From earlier studies, the pseudogap was associated with a SDW gap due to local AF correlations . Very recent measurements of high-frequency conductivity that track the phase- correlation time in the normal state of underdoped Bi2212 showed that the incoherent Cooper pairs remain up to T pair which is well above T c , however, lower than T* .  Thus, between T c and T pair , there is a contribution of incoherent Cooper pairs to the pseudogap. Indeed, there is a consensus on that, to the contrary to conventional SCs, the formation of the Copper pairs and the establishment of the phase coherence among them in cuprates occur at different temperatures, T pair > T c .  So, it is reasonable to expect that the incoherent Cooper pairs have to be observed above T c in different types of measurements including tunneling.The T pair scales with T*, thus, the difference between T pair and T c is the highest in the underdoped regime and becomes smaller in the overdoped regime ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Shortly, many break-junctions were prepared by gluing a sample with epoxy on a flexible insulating substrate and then were broken by bending the substrate with a differential screw at 14 -18 K in a helium atmosphere. The electrical contacts were made by attaching gold wires to a crystal with silver paint. The sample resistance (with the contacts), R sample , at room temperature varied from 5 \u2126 to about 1 k\u2126, depending on the sample. The I(V) and dI/dV(V) tunneling characteristics were determined by the four-terminal method using a standard lock-in modulation technique. The tunneling spectra of our break junctions on Bi2212 single crystals exhibit below T c the characteristic features of typical tunneling spectra in Bi2212 . shows a set of normalized tunneling conductance curves measured in superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) between 14 K and 290 K on an overdoped Bi2212 single crystal with T c = 88.5 K.    All curves, except the last one, show a gaplike structure.In the absence of generally accepted model for the pseudogap, we consider the presence of the gap-like features in tunneling spectra as a sign of the pseudogap (for more details, see Ref. ). There is no sign indicating at what temperature the superconducting gap was closed. Across T c , the superconducting tunneling spectra evolve continuously into a normal- state quasiparticle-gap structure which vanishes at 232 K < T * < 290 K but remains almost unchanged with temperature up to 232 K . Such evolution of superconducting spectra into normal-state spectra across T c has been also observed in superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) junctions .  Thus, it is clear that the pseudogap is related somehow to the superconductivity .The spectra in show the change in conductance from very low to high temperatures.  It is difficult in such scale to see the differences between spectra above T c . Therefore, shows tunneling spectra only above T c , measured on another overdoped Bi2212 single crystal with T c = 88 K. In , one can see that there is a gap-like structure just above T c which disappears at some temperature T 0 much lower than T*.Most pseudogap data observed in our study look similar to the data presented in , however, measurements on the best samples show some gap-like features in tunneling spectra above T c, which look similar to the gap-like structure shown in .Therefore, we believe that these features reflect intrinsic properties of overdoped Bi2212."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This contribution can be explained by the disappearance of the CDW or/and SDW order(s), or incoherent Cooper pairs. From the common sense, the CDW or SDW order is likely to be appear above T c and not to disappear. Consequently, it is most likely that this contribution to the pseudogap is made by preformed pairs . Tunneling spectroscopy is sensitive exclusively to the magnitude of the order parameter. Thus, if the humps originate from the presence of preformed pairs, then the magnitude of the gap-like structure reflects the average value of binding energy per particle . However, our results alone cannot prove that this contribution originates from preformed pairs. We can argue that high-frequency conductivity measurements showed that the incoherent Copper pairs remain well above T c in Bi2212, and it was predicted by the theory .  It is also in agreement with a MCS (Magnetic Coupling between Stripes) model proposed very recently . There is also an alternative explanation for the presence of this contribution to the pseudogap, it is possible that this contribution originates from the presence of the Bi2223 phase with T c = 110 K.

This compound is the first to be discovered supercon- ducting Co oxide and moreover, it has been claimed that there is a marked resemblance between this compound and high T C cuprates. The first similarity is that the compound has a layered structure composed of two- dimensional (2D) CoO 2 planes, separated by a thick insu- lating layer of Na ions and water molecules.  As is widely known, high T C cuprates have also layered structures with 2D CuO 2 planes which play an essential role in the high T C superconductivity. The second similarity is re- lated to valences and spin states of the transition metals.The Cu ions of the high T C cuprates are of mixed-valence states by hole doping; Cu 2+ (S=1/2) ions are partially oxidized to Cu 3+ (S=0) ions. In a similar way, the Co ion in the Co oxide is either Co 4+ (d 5 ) or Co 3+ (d 6 ) with a spin state of S=1/2 or S=0, respectively, assuming low- spin configurations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The solid line in represents Eq. 4 and seems to re- produce the data well. On the other hand, as seen in , high-field magnetization increases linearly with increasing field above 15 T.  Thus, if the Curie-Weiss-like upturn is caused by the magnetic impurity, its magneti- zation must be saturated above 15 T. In other words, the slope of the magnetization above 15 T should be equal to the magnetic susceptibility corresponding to the Pauli paramagnetism terms. However, the value of 4.9 \u00d7 10 \u22124 emu/mol, which was calculated from the slope of the magnetization between 15 T and 30 T, is different from 3.02 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (= \u03c7 0 + A \u00d7 4.2 2 ) emu/mol, obviously be- yond experimental uncertainty.

The lattice parameters obtained for LiFeP are a = 3.692\u00c5, c = 6.031\u00c5 22 compared to a = 3.670\u00c5, c = 6.108\u00c5 for LiFeAs at 6.54 GPa.The lattice parameters a and c in LiFeAs are contracted by 2.7% and 3.9%, respectively, at 6.54 GPa, whereas the replacement of As by P reveals a highly anisotropic contraction of a and c by 2.1% and 5.1%, respectively.     This leads to a smaller structural anisotropy in LiFeP compared to LiFeAs at 6.54 GPa. It has been pointed out for the iron-pnictides that T c attains maximum val- ues when the [FePn 4 ], where P n = P, As, form a regular tetrahedron.At ambient pressure the [FeP 4 ] tetrahe- dron of LiFeP is only slightly distorted with \u03b1 = 108.58 \u2022 and \u03b2 = 109.92 \u2022 , while LiFeAs at 6.54 GPa pos- sesses a highly distorted tetrahedron \u03b1 = 99.39 \u2022 and \u03b2 = 114.70 \u2022 .The bond angle of a regular tetrahe- dron is 109.47 \u2022 .A nearly perfect [FeP 4 ] tetrahedron in LiFeP, but a highly distorted [FeAs 4 ] tetrahedron in LiFeAs and taking into account a similar T c in both ma- terials suggest that the perfectness of the [FePn 4 ] tetra- hedron is not the determining property for the value of T c.Moreover, our result suggests that changes in the DOS other than those strictly related to the perfect- ness of the [FePn 4 ] tetrahedron are governing the value"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

However, our experiments reveal that supercon- ductivity in LiFeP is more robust than in LiFeAs.  In LiFeAs T c (p) decreases linearly on increasing pressure in the whole pressure range up to \u223c 10 GPa. The initial slope of T c (p) |dT c (p)/dp | p=0 | = 1.23 K/GPa for LiFeP is significantly smaller compared to the value in LiFeAs, |dT c (p)/dp | p=0 | = (1.56 \u223c 2) K/GPa.  Since T c (p) decreases linearly in LiFeAs, the same significant differ- ence in the slopes of T c (p) is present when we compare them where the T c 's of LiFeP at p = 0 and LiFeAs un- der pressure (5.5 \u2212 6.5 GPa) are matching. This clearly indicates that the superconductivity in LiFeP is more ro- bust than in LiFeAs.This is furthermore supported by a decreasing slope of T c (p) upon increasing pressure in LiFeP (see ).      Therefore, our study suggests that a more regular [FePn 4 ] tetrahedron \"strengthens\" the su- perconducting state, but is not determining the size of T c .  We will now turn to the unusual increase of the low- temperature normal-state resistivity above p \u2248 2 GPa.While the residual resistivity, \u03c1 0 (p), increases by about 1/3 from 1.68 GPa to 2.75 GPa, the A coefficient stays nearly pressure independent in this pressure range. This indicates that the QP-QP scattering rate does not change, but additional contributions to the residual scat- tering appear and become stronger upon increasing pres- sure.Since, as we discussed before, \u03c1 300K (p) decreases in the mentioned pressure range and, thus, we can exclude an extrinsic reason and, clearly, pressure does not add im- purities, a different scattering mechanism has to be con- sidered.An increase of \u03c1 0 (p) is generally caused by addi- tional disordered scattering centers.A similar increase of the resistivity at low temperatures is observed in LiFeAs, but at much higher pressures p 11 GPa.There, it has been proposed that additional disordered scatter- ing centers created by local magnetic ordering cause the enhanced \u03c1 0 .Increasing pressure reduces the in-plane Fe-Fe distance and concomitantly enhances local mag- netic correlations leading to additional magnetic scatter- ing centers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Many superconductors in TMOs crystallize in perovskite related structures.  Recently, an exceptional TMO superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 was found with T c = 1.0 K, which crystallizes in the pyrochlore structure. 1) The pyrochlore structure contains a corner-sharing tetrahedral network made of transition metal cations called the pyrochlore lattice, and is known as one of spin frustration systems in the case that the transition metal cation has a localized moment with antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbors.   Very recently, three related compounds AOs 2 O 6 (A = K, Rb, Cs) named the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxides were found, 2-4) which contain the pyrochlore lattice made of Os atoms.They show superconductivity at T c = 9.6 K, 6.3 K and 3.3 K, respectively. Particularly in KOs 2 O 6 the T c is almost one order higher than in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 .  The mechanism of the superconductivity has been extensively studied and was suggested to be unconventional.     For example, a remarkably large upper critical field H c2 of 38 T exceeding Pauli's limit was reported for KOs 2 O 6 . 5) Moreover, the \u00b5SR and NMR experiments suggested an anisotropic order parameter.On the other hand, there are a few reports which suggest conventional BCS superconductivity for RbOs 2 O 6 . It is plausible to assume that the systematic change of T c in AOs 2 O 6 is due to the size effect of alkaline metal ions. The lattice constant is almost proportional to the ionic radius of A ions, and the T c increases with decreasing the lattice constant from Cs to K under a positive chemical pressure. 4) This is in contrast to the case of conventional BCS superconductivity in a single-band model, where the T c decreases under a positive pressure, because the density of state (DOS) decreases with decreasing the lattice volume, as typically observed in alkali metal doped C 60 superconductors A 3 C 60 .This contrast may indicate the uniqueness of the superconductivity in AOs 2 O 6 . Thus, it is interesting to examine physical pressure effects on T c .In this note, we report diamagnetic measurements under pressures up to 1.2 GPa using a piston-cylinder type pressure cell on the three compounds of AOs 2 O 6 .  In the \u03b1-pyrochlore oxide superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 the high pressure study revealed that T c increases from 1.0 K to 3.0 K at 2 GPa and then decreases to vanish above 3 GPa. In the case of RbOs 2 O 6 , Khasanov et al. reported a high pressure experiment in which the T c increases monotonously up to 1.0 GPa with the initial slope of 0.90 K/GPa. Polycrystalline samples were prepared as reported previously. 2-4) They were nearly single-phase, but with a small amount of OsO 2 or Os metal.Magnetic susceptibility was measured in a Quantum Design MPMS.Quasi-hydrostatic pressures up to 1.2 GPa were produced by a piston-cylinder type pressure cell which is made of hardened CuBe alloy.Daphne oil 7373 was used as a pressure transmitting medium.The actual pressure was determined in each experiment by measuring the superconducting transition temperature of Pb or Sn which was put into the pressure medium together with a sample and placed about 2 cm away from the sample."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question. \nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n----------------\nWe investigate T c and magnetic penetration depth \u03bb(T) near the superconductor-metal quantum phase transition in overdoped La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 films.  Both T c and superfluid density n s , \uf0b5 \u03bb -2 , decrease with overdoping. They obey the scaling relation T c \uf0b5 [\u03bb -2 (0)] \u03b1 with \u03b1 \uf0bb \u00bd. We discuss this result in the frameworks of disordered d-wave superconductors and of scaling near quantum critical points. Our result, and the linear scaling (\u03b1 \uf0bb 1) found for the more anisotropic T\uf06c 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+\u03b4 , can both be understood in terms of quantum critical scaling, with different dimensionalities for fluctuations. The superconductor-to-nonsuperconductor transitions in cuprates, as functions of carrier concentration, give insights into quantum phase transitions (QPT's) in general [1] and into the phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity in particular [2-4].  On the underdoped side, the transition is from superconducting to an insulating state with a (pseudo)gap in the electronic excitation spectrum that remains finite through the QPT. The fundamental physics on the overdoped side of the phase diagram is profoundly different because there is no pseudogap, the superconducting gap becomes progressively smaller [5] with doping, and the QPT is from superconductor to a metal that looks like a conventional Fermi liquid in many respects.Key issues are: (i) Are these transitions first-order or are they quantum critical points (QCP) where quantum fluctuations of the order parameter are important? (ii) How does the presence or absence of an energy gap impact the transitions? (iii) Are these transitions driven by a collapse of the pairing amplitude or by fluctuations of the phase of the superconducting order parameter? (iv) Does anisotropy (c-axis vs. ab-plane) affect the dimensionality of the QCP's? T c as a function of hole doping p takes a quasi-universal form [6], with superconductivity existing for 0.3 \u2272 p \u2272 0.30, with a maximum at p \uf0bb 0.15, independent of the maximum value of T c or of c vs. ab-plane anisotropy.  Thus, one might expect a common explanation for the over-and underdoped quantum phase transitions in different compounds.  An early study of several underdoped cuprate compounds suggested that T c and superfluid density [n s \uf0b5 \u03bb -2 , \u03bb = magnetic penetration depth] might be linearly proportional: T c \uf0b5 \u03bb -2 (0), with a universal slope as critical underdoping is approached [7]. This linear scaling led to the widely accepted view that classical thermal phase fluctuations destroy superconductivity [4] in underdoped cuprates when the superfluid density becomes small, even as the energy gap remains intact.This long-standing view was overturned recently by measurements on severely underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-\u03b4 (YBCO) films and crystals showing that scaling is actually sublinear: T c \uf0b5 [\u03bb -2 (0)] \u03b1 with \u03b1 \uf0bb 0.5.  Sublinear scaling, together with the absence of critical thermal fluctuations near T c , pointed to a 3D QCP .The QCP hypothesis was put to a stringent test in a study of two-unit-cell-thick underdoped YBCO films that were 2D by construction.Indeed, linear scaling expected near a 2D QCP was observed for these ultrathin films ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The slope of the KTB line in Fig. is calculated assuming that the film fluctuates as a single 2D entity. For independently fluctuating layers, the slope of the KTB line would be 70 times larger.

Taken by itself, this behavior may be viewed as a consequence of a mean-field gap collapse in a disordered d-wave superconductor. On the other hand, if one seeks a common explanation for the nonlinear scaling in LSCO and the linear scaling in T\uf06c2201, then one is led to the interpretation that the scaling observed for strongly overdoped samples is due to 3D and 2D quantum critical points, respectively.  The difference in dimensionality would be due to the much higher anisotropy of T\uf06c2201. Finally, in moderately underdoped LSCO we observe nonlinear T c vs. \u03bb -2 (0) scaling that is quantitatively similar to that of underdoped YBCO.

The Tb and Ce based RE:123 compounds do not even form in the orthorhombic structure typical of RE:123 compounds .  The situation is particularly interesting in the case of Pr:123 where the crystal structure is exactly the same as that of the other 90K superconducting RE:123 compounds and yet no superconductivity is observed in this compound . In addition to the absence of superconductivity, the Pr ion in the Pr:123 possess an unusually high N\u00e9el temperature, T N, of about 17K Several explanations have been proposed in the literature to explain the absence of superconductivity in Pr:123 and related compounds.    These include hole filling (considering Pr to be in the tetravalent valence state ), hole localization (considering Pr to be in the trivalent state), or pair breaking .In fact, there are contradictory claims about the valence state of Pr in Pr:123 and related compounds. The hole-filling model is contradicted by the electron energy loss spectroscopy results where the total hole concentration in Y 1-x Pr x :123 has been reported to be nearly the same as in other RE:123 compounds .In another more viable model, the Pr(4f) electrons are assumed to hybridize with the carriers in the Cu-O 2 conduction planes.

While certain experiments indicated an unexpected type-I superconducting phase, other experiments re- vealed formation of vortices under the application of magnetic fields. Recently, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed the existence of a mixed phase where type-I and type-II behaviours coexist. Here, based on our temperature and magnetic field dependent STS experiments on Cu-intercalated PdTe2 we show that as the critical temperature of the superconducting phase goes up from 1.7 K to 2.4 K on Cu-intercalation, the mixed phase disappears and the system be- comes homogeneously type-II.

Though initial experi- mental papers suggested the possibility of an unconven- tional nature of the superconducting phase of PdTe 2 , a number of experiments confirmed that the superconduc- tivity in PdTe 2 is conventional in nature .  How- ever, some of these experiments found evidence of type I behaviour as far as the magnetic properties of the su- perconducting phase of PdTe 2 are concerned .These contradicted with certain other experiments where the magnetic properties were found to be consistent with type II superconductivity .  More recently, magnetic field dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy exper- iments revealed coexistence of type I and type II do- mains in PdTe 2 where such an inhomogeneity of the su- perconducting phase was attributed to electronic inho- mogeneities observed in the normal state of PdTe 2 . It turned out that the electronic inhomogeneity could alter the local electron density and the local coherence length thereby leading to a distribution of the Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gorkov (GLAG) parameter (\u03ba) over the surface of PdTe 2 .  Within this picture, it should be possible to disorder the system so that inter-domain scattering of the quasiparticles can average out the \u03ba dis- tribution and make the system homogeneous.In this pa- per, we report the observation of such averaging effect in Cu-PdTe 2 by magnetic field dependent scanning tun- neling spectroscopy experiments.The superconducting phase becomes homogeneously type II while the critical temperature gets enhanced at randomly distributed do- mains on the surface due to random distribution of the intercalates ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Such measurements on polycrystalline samples indicated that the higher T c in Cu-PdTe 2 is due to enhanced electron-phonon coupling parameter (\u03bb ph ) and increased density of states upon Cu- intercalation.  For the spectroscopic measurements presented in this paper we used high quality single crys- tals of Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 with 4% Cu in the crys- tals. The shiny single crystals were first mounted in a ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cleaving stage integrated with the STM.  The crystals were then cleaved at 80 K us- ing a cleaver attached to an UHV manipulator.After cleaving, the crystals were immediately transferred to the STM head which is cooled down to 310 mK using a H 3 -based cryostat. The sample is placed at the center of a solenoidal superconducting magnet with a maximum field strength of 11 Tesla. All the STM/S experiments re- ported in this paper were performed with sharp metallic tips of tungsten (W). The tips were fabricated by electro- chemical etching and were cleaned by electron beam bom- bardment under UHV in a preparation chamber attached to the STM prior to the low temperature experiments. The formation of the superconducting phase with T c = 2.6 K is seen in the susceptibility versus temperature data presented in (b)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The conventional nature of the tem- perature dependence is also found in case of the two en- ergy gaps that are measured in Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 .  The temperature dependent spectra along with the the- oretical fits are shown in (a) for the phase with higher \u2206 and in (b) for the phase with lower \u2206. Surprisingly, in both the cases, while the lowest temper- ature spectra showed no additional features other than the sharp coherence peaks, at slightly elevated temper- atures a small zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) is also seen to appear. When the emergence of the ZBCP is considered along with the slight deviation of the ex- perimental spectra from the theoretical fit, it is impor- tant to first investigate whether a tiny unconventional component in the order parameter can be present here. Such a ZBCP may appear due to a small unconventional component in the gap function that has a different tem- perature dependence than the dominating conventional component. In order to understand this point clearly, let us consider a temperature dependent gap amplitude given by \u2206(T ) = \u03b1\u2206 s (T ) + \u03b2\u2206 un (T ), where \u2206 s is the conventional component and \u2206 un is the unconventional component of the gap, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the respective coefficients. Now, since the ZBCP does not appear at low temperatures, it is clear that at those temperatures, \u03b1\u2206 s \u03b2\u2206 un . Now, with increasing temperature, due to the possible difference in temperature dependence of \u2206 s and \u2206 un , at some point, the contribution of \u2206 un may become comparable to \u2206 s thereby making the un- conventional contribution detectable in the form of the ZBCP. Beyond this temperature, as shown in the data, all the spectroscopic features related to superconductiv- ity get systematically reduced with a complete disappear- ance of the spectral features at T c . It should be noted that while the possibility of an unconventional compo- nent cannot be ruled out, the ZBCP may also originate from other sources, like inelastic impurity scattering with non-trivial temperature dependence. Since no ZBCP is seen in pure PdTe 2 , here, the enhanced scattering may be due to the impurity states of the Cu intercalates.  Since the strength of the ZBCP is significantly smaller than the overall spectra, we have fitted the temperature de- pendent spectra ignoring the ZBCP.The temperature dependent \u2206 thus obtained, are plotted in (c) and (d) respectively for the larger \u2206 and the smaller \u2206. The red dots represent the measured values of \u2206 and the solid lines show the expected temperature dependence within BCS theory, barring a slight devia- tion at higher temperatures. In both the cases, the tem- perature evolution of the spectra is consistent with BCS theory. From the measured valued of \u2206 and T c , it is seen that \u2206/k B T c are \u223c 2.56 and 3.15 corresponding to the larger \u2206 and the smaller \u2206 respectively. This means, the regions where the effect of intercalation is smaller, \u2206/k B T c is higher.  This shows that the elctron-phonon coupling strength decreases upon Cu-intercalation. This result apparently contradicts the theoretical finding of an enhanced electron-phonon coupling constant (\u03bb ph ) in Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 . Therefore, our results sug- gest that the enhancement in T c in Cu-PdTe 2 is primarily due to the enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy and not due to altered electron-phonon coupling. How- ever, these two processes may compete with each other giving rise to an effective enhancement of superconduct- ing properties in Cu-PdTe 2 .  Now we focus on the magnetic field dependent spec- troscopic measurements on Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 . As it was discovered before, the surface of pure PdTe 2 hosts co-existence of domains with type I and type II super- conductivity. In the type I domains, the superconducting spectra suddenly disappeared under the application of a low magnetic field \u223c 250 Oe. In the type II regions, the spectra survived up to much higher magnetic fields and the spectral features were seen to disappear continuously. Such variation of the type of superconductivity based on magnetic properties could be attributed to inhomo- geneity of local coherence length (\u03be).An inhomogeneous background possibly responsible for such inhomogeneity in \u03be was found in the normal state conductance maps.Within this understanding, introduction of disorder into the crystal is expected to reduce \u03be everywhere."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In all cases, the conductance spectra, regardless of the corre- sponding superconducting energy gaps and T c , evolved systematically and smoothly with magnetic field.  The spectral features continuously became less prominent eventually disappearing at a critical field characteristic for the point where the spectroscopic measurement was performed. The critical fields measured in these cases are 10 kG, 17 kG and 4.5 kG respectively. The ubiquitously observed very low critical field (\u223c 220 Oe) in PdTe 2 was not detected on any point in Cu-PdTe 2 .  It should be noted that the measured critical fields at different points is much larger than the expected \"surface critical field\" (H s \u223c 1.7H c ) in BCS superconductors.Hence the enhancement is not due to a naturally enhanced sur- face critical field. In (c), we also show Dyne's fit of one set of the magnetic field dependent spectra and the variation of the superconducting energy gap with in- creasing magnetic field is shown in (d), where the smooth disappearance of the gap is clearly visible. This observation indicates that the superconductivity of Cu-PdTe 2 has become uniformly of type II throughout the crystal upon intercalation of Cu. This is different from the mixed type I and type II superconducting phase that was observed in pure PdTe 2 .  The observation of the uniformly type II behaviour of the superconducting phase upon Cu-intercalation sup- ports the idea that the mixed type I and type II phase in pure PdTe 2 originated from a distribution of the local coherence length (\u03be) and consequent distribution of \u03ba. Introduction of disorder in the lattice causes increased scattering and a consequent decrease in the electronic mean free path (l) leading to a decreased \u03be following the relation 1/\u03be = 1/\u03be 0 + 1/l, where \u03be 0 is the BCS coher- ence length in the absolute clean limit. When the local \u03be in the type I regions decrease, the GLAG parameter (\u03ba) also decreases and consequently these regions should show magnetic properties of that of type II supercon- ductors.The criteria for the transition from a type I to a type II superconducting state in terms of the mean free path (l) has been discussed elsewhere where it was also shown that beyond a critical value of l, the super- conducting phase is expected to become homogeneously type II."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In a type II superconductor, such a sudden change may be associated with the emergence of a su- perconducting vortex in an area very close to the STM tip thereby causing the suppression of local \u2206. As shown in the \u0393 vs. H plot in (d), as \u2206 shows a sud- den drop, \u0393 shows a simultaneous upward jump (by a factor of 6) at approximately the same magnetic field. \u0393 represents pair breaking mechanisms leading to finite quasiparticle lifetime. Hence, this observation is consis- tent with the field-induced pair breaking under the STM tip, possibly due to the emergence of a nearby vortex core. However, despite our repeated attempts, we did not find spectra with clear zero-bias conductance peak in presence of magnetic field. To note, such zero-bias peaks in presence of sufficiently large magnetic field were frequently observed in pure PdTe 2 . It is possible that in case of Cu-PdTe 2, the nature of the vortex core spectrum changes and becomes featureless and hence remains un- detectable in our experiments.  Beyond the field at which the sudden change happens, both \u2206 and \u0393 change grad- ually and beyond a certain field \u0393 becomes larger than \u2206 thereby suppressing the key spectroscopic features."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In addition to T c enhancement, due to increased disorder, the surface of Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 becomes uniformly type II with no signature of co-existing type I phase anywhere.

The conventional theory is based on the Migdal-Eliashberg adiabatic approximation that, in fact, leads to the prediction of many peculiar features which are a di- rect evidence of a phonon mediated superconductivity. The adiabatic approximation is valid if the parameter \u03c9 0 /E f is small (\u03c9 0 is the relevant phonon frequency and E f is the Fermi energy). Usually this parameter is regarded as a measure of nonadibaticity. However, crossover from a conventional adiabatic to an unconven- tional nonadiabatic regime does not depend only on the value of the \u03c9 0 /E f ratio. Paci et al. show that even in a case of small \"adiabatic\" ratio one would ex- pect the nonadiabatic coupling in superconductors hav- ing high value of the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb el\u2212ph . Among BCS superconductors the zirconium do- decaboride (ZrB 12 ) is probably a candidate for the ob- servation of such type of anomalous coupling.  It stems from the rather small value of the Fermi energy \u223c1 eV that, together with the Debye temperature \u223c20 meV , leads to a ratio \u03c9 0 /E f \u223c0.02. A strong coupling ratio 2\u2206/k B T c \u2243 4.8 was observed by surface sensitive techniques . This suggests that the electron-phonon coupling constant, which has a bulk value \u03bb el\u2212ph \u2243 0.67 , increases at the surface. From the comparison with strong coupled metallic superconductors one would expect \u03bb surf. el\u2212ph \u2243 1.7 \u2212 1.9.

Note, that in adiabatic superconductors (or in the su- perconductors where the nonadiabatic effects are small) the pressure effect (PE) as well as the isotope effect (IE) on \u03bb was found to be almost negligi- ble in comparison with substantial PE and IE on \u03bb observed in highly nonadiabatic high-T c cuprates. In this paper we report on PE on T c and \u03bb studies in ZrB 12 superconductor.  The magnetic penetration depth measured in the Meissner state is largely determined by the surface characteristics. The absolute value of \u03bb at zero temperature and zero pressure was found to be \u03bb(0) = 140(30) nm.

For clean superconductor the temperature dependence of \u03bb \u22122 can be described in the following way : where F = (1 + exp(E/k B T ) \u22121 is the Fermi function, \u2206(T ) = \u2206 0 \u2022\u2206(T /T c ) represents the temperature de- pendence of the energy gap, and \u2206 0 is the zero tem- perature value of the superconducting gap.\u2206(T /T c ) is the normalized gap taken from Ref. . The best fit to the data using Eq. gives T c = 6.09(2) K, \u03bb \u22122 (0) = 47.4(2) nm, and \u2206 0 = 1.251(9) meV.  The ra- tio 2\u2206 0 /k B T c = 4.77(4) is found, suggesting that ZrB 12 is a strong coupled BCS superconductor. Note, that a rather close value 2\u2206 0 /k B T c \u2243 4.8 has been obtained in point-contact spectroscopy and tunnelling ex- periments. From the other hand a smaller value \u22433.7 has been reported by Lortz et al. using the heat- capacitance technique, thus suggesting a weak coupling strength. This difference has been already pointed out by Tsindlekht et al. . It was explained by enhanced surface characteristics of the ZrB 12 leading to rather dif- ferent superconducting properties of bulk and surface .  Our measurements were performed in the Meissner state, with the field penetrating on a dis- tance \u03bb from the surface and, therefore, give a value of the superconducting gap consistent with those one reported in the surface sensitive experiments .To estimate the uncertainty in the absolute value of \u03bb(0) we used a procedure similar to that one described in Refs. . The temperature dependence of \u03bb(T ) was calculated for N (R) + N (R) and N (R) \u2212 N (R) distributions. The fit of the resulting \u03bb(T ) curves with the power law as well as with the BCS model gives \u03bb(0) in the range from 110 to 170 nm. shows the pressure dependence of \u03bb \u22122 (0) obtained by fitting the reconstructed \u03bb(T ) data at dif- ferent pressures with the BCS model [Eq. ]. In these experiments we studied relative effects measured on the same sample in the same pressure cell. The main system- atic error of these measurements comes from misalign- ments of the experimental setup occurring when the cell is removed from the SQUID magnetometer, to change the pressure, and put back again. This procedure was checked with a set of measurements at constant pressure. The systematic scattering of the magnetization data is about 0.3%, giving a relative error in \u03bb \u22122 (T ) of about 3%. The reducing of the grain size with pressure was taken into account in \u03bb(T ) calculation [Eq. (4)], by using the bulk modulus reported above. The linear fit yields \u03bb \u22122 (0) = 48.4(7)+ 0.29p implying that \u03bb \u22122 increases under pressure with d ln \u03bb \u22122 (0)/dp = 0.60(23)%/kbar [see ]."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The problem is clearly related to the degree of hole doping attain- able: in the Ga based materials, although the appro- priate Nd/Ce ratios can be made, the compound is highly oxygen deficient; for the Co and Al based ma- terials, even at O 2 pressures up to 30 atm, a maxi- mum of only half the appropriate hole doping is ob- tained, as the proper Nd:Ce ratios cannot be made.It may be that synthesis under higher oxygen pres- sures and/or temperatures would lead to supercon- ductivity in this structure type, through the attain- ment of the correct hole concentration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The c-axis is perpendicular to the Cu-O planes. In oxygen-doped La 2 CuO 4+y , the excess oxygen is intercalated between the Cu-O planes and forms a sine-density-wave, which is periodic along the c-axis. This behavior is called staging. Stage-n cor- responds to a period of n Cu-O layers. The sample stud- ied here is predominantly in the stage-4 phase, which has its superconducting transition at T c = 43 K.   The onset of static long-range magnetic order coincides with the on- set of superconductivity. Note that T c = 43 K is higher than that of optimally-doped La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 , which is possibly due to the absence of quenched disorder from a random distribution of Sr 2+ dopants.Previous neutron scattering experiments show no gap in the spin excita- tions in this sample.   Our sample shows the onset of a diamagnetic signal at 43 K when measuring magnetization at an applied magnetic field of 3 Oe (see the main panel of Fig. ). The structure observed in the magnetization at around 32 K almost certainly comes from small inclusions of the stage-6 phase with T c = 32 K.

The staging of the interstitial oxygen is accompanied by a periodic re- versal in the direction of the tilt of the CuO 6 octahedra along the c-axis. This will likely cause a small change in the phonon spectrum. However, such a difference would give rise to a change in the specific heat that is mono- tonic with increasing temperature, rather than the broad peak we observe.  The broad peak is reminiscent of the Schottky anomaly for a system with a finite number of excited states, such as a spin-1 2 moment in a magnetic field. From the temperature of the peak we infer that, were such two-level systems responsible for the excess specific heat, the energy splitting of the two levels would be \u223c 7 meV.

Indeed, above T c we use the BCS estimate \u03b3=\u2206C/1.43 T c \u2248 6 mJ/mol K 2 , far less than that observed.  In addition, as for any change in the phonon spectrum, free carriers are not expected to give a peak in the specific heat. We suggest, instead, that the excess specific heat shown in Fig. comes from a change in the spectrum of spin excitations resulting from the doping. The contribu- tion of the spins to the specific heat in the 2D S= 1 2 square lattice Heisenberg AFM (Quantum Heisenberg Antifer- romagnet QHA) become important at temperatures of order the in-plane exchange constant J.  Monte-Carlo simulations of this model show that the heat capacity exhibits a broad peak at k B T \u2243 0.6 J . Since the excess specific heat reported here is observed at 50 K, as- cribing the excess specific heat to that of a QHA would imply that J is suppressed from \u223c 135 meV to \u223c 7 meV by doping.However, this conclusion contradicts results from neutron scattering.   The instantaneous magnetic correlation length, measured by integrating over all the energies up to \u223c 100 meV is almost constant as a func- tion of temperature in the optimally-doped or slightly underdoped La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 . 1 If J were in fact reduced by doping to 7 meV, then the correlation length would rise dramatically at low temperatures. Although the in- stantaneous correlation length has not been measured in oxygen-doped La 2 CuO 4+y , its magnetic dynamics is very similar to slightly underdoped LSCO.Furthermore, we have measured the widths in q-space of the magnetic fluc- tuation peaks associated with the SDW order and find no increase in their width up to \u223c 9 meV. This allows us to place a lower bound on J in the superconductor of 60 meV.We conclude that the excess specific heat is not described by the QHA with reduced J."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The latter shows a maximum as the energy transfer is lowered, at around 7 meV, before going to zero at lower energy. This maximum is most pronounced near the supercon- ducting transition temperature. This behavior shows that there is an enhancement of the (\u03c0, \u03c0) spin fluctua- tions at \u223c 7 meV in La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 of similar hole den- sity to the La 2 CuO 4.11 sample studied here. The suscep-tibility around (\u03c0, \u03c0) of La 2 CuO 4.11 does not show such a maximum, but rather is approximately constant at low energies.   For the latter material \u03c7 \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) is enhanced at low energies relative to that in La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 because of the magnons associated with the static long-range-ordered incommensurate SDW.However, muon measurements in- dicate that the local magnetic order is fully developed microscopically at only about 40% of the muon sites. The remaining 60% of the sample, which has a very small ordered moment, is likely to have spin excitations closely similar to those in La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 (x=0.14) and should exhibit the enhanced spin fluctuations at around 7 meV. We speculate, therefore, that the broad anomaly in the specific heat reflects the enhanced magnetic fluctuations coming from the disordered 2D spin-1 2 system.  Naively, one expects the entropy associated with these fluctuations to be even smaller than the contribution from the moments that order below 42K.Consequently, the large enhancement of spin fluctuations observed in the experiments must the result of an interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom.The relevant energy scale for the charge degrees of freedom is given by the su- perconducting transition temperature, T c = 43 K, close to the temperature at which the excess specific heat is observed."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In particular, magneti- zation vs. temperature curves taken at different fields are expected to collapse to a single function when the variables are plotted.Here the exponent s is 1 2 for 2D fluc- tuations and 2 3 for 3D behavior.  The function T c (H), the transition temperature as a function of field, is chosen in order to optimize the scaling. Fig. shows the scaling of variables Eq. (3) for 3D (panel A) and 2D (panel B) vortex fluctuations, in fields up to 5 T. The differences between the curves for the 2D case are appreciable, and we are not able to find a T c (H) function that makes the different curves collapse. In con- trast, panel A shows 3D scaling, for which all the curves up to 5 T scale within experimental error. The inset in Fig. shows the function T c (H) used in the scaling.Curves at 6 and 7 T were not included in Fig. because they start deviating from the other curves, presumably due to a departure from the scaling behavior."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Single crystals from arc-melted samples were mounted on the tips of Kapton loops and room-temperature intensity data were collected using a Bruker Apex II x-ray diffractometer with Mo K\u03b1 1 radiation (\u03bb\uf0a0=\uf0a00.710 73 \u00c5). All data were collected with 0.5\u00b0scans in \u03c9 over a full sphere of reciprocal space with 10 s per frame of exposure time. Data acquisition was carried out using the SMART software. The program VESTA was used to create all crystal structure images . The SAINT program was used to both extract and correct intensities for polarization and Lorentz effects. XPREP, which is based on face-indexed absorption, was used for numerical absorption corrections . The unit cell was tes- ted for twinning. The crystal structure was then solved using direct methods with the SHELXTL package and the refine- ment was carried out by full-matrix least squares on F 2 . A Rietveld refinement of the room temperature powder x-ray diffraction (pXRD) data was performed using the FullProf Suite program with Thompson-Cox-Hastings pseudo-Voigt peak shapes and the lattice parameters from the single crystal refinement as a starting point."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Although the occupancy of 0.665 for the W2 position is within error of a value of 2/3, which has the potential to result in a long range ordered structure, no evidence for W2 ordering is observed, consistent with previous reports .The structure can be considered as either a highly defective or highly non-stoichiometric version of WB 2 .There is also no crystallographic evidence for a wide range in stoichiometry for this compound ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Within various iron- pnictide superconductors, we have focused on the isovalent- P-substituted BaFe 2 (As 1\u2212x P x ) 2 system and carried out comprehensive NMR studies on the system.  This is because the isovalent P substitution introduces a negligible change in carrier concentration but changes magnetic interactions sys- tematically.In addition, very clean single crystals are avail- able for various measurements.  By investigating the spin dy- namics probed via P-NMR as a function of P concentration, we showed that the maximum T c is observed at the P concen- tration at which magnetic order vanishes; thus, we suggested that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations associated with quantum criticality play a central role in obtaining high-T c su- perconductivity. We consider that the study of the coexistence of mag- netism and superconductivity, which is observed in the phase boundary, would give important information about the super- conducting (SC) properties and mechanism.  There are ex- perimental reports not only from macroscopic and neutron scattering measurements but from microscopic measure- ments of the coexistence and competition of magnetism and superconductivity in iron pnictides. We point out that diffraction measurements give magnetic moments averaged over a wider spatial region and cannot provide microscopic information about the coexistence.It remains an open ques- tion whether an SC phase transition occurs in a magnetic re- gion of a sample or the superconductivity in a magnetic region is induced by the penetration of a nonmagnetic SC region and whether the same or different electronic states contribute to magnetism and superconductivity.In this paper, we report the occurrence of the SC transition in a magnetic region of the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordering, which is concluded from the investigation of internal field and nuclear spin-lattice re- laxation rate 1/T 1 by site-selective NMR measurements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

These re- sults suggest that the sharp (broad) NMR peak arises from the region where P concentration is slightly higher (lower) than x = 0.25.

The shape of the spec- trum reflects the field distribution at the P site; thus, it is related to the magnetic structure of the moments. The aver- age of the internal field is related to the magnitude of the ordered moment, which is the order parameter of the AFM state.

Figures show the field- swept NMR spectra and the temperature dependence of the H int at the P site and estimated M , which are determined by the same procedure as that in the case of the x = 0.25 sam- ple.

It should be noted that the paramagnetic signal was not observed at all in the sample, indicating that the entire region of the x = 0.20 sample at P \u223c 2 GPa is in the magnetic state below T N and then shows superconductivity below T * c .These results indi- cate the microscopic coexistence of magnetism and supercon- ductivity, and the suppression of the magnetic order parameter below T * c both for the x = 0.25 sample at ambient pressure and for the x = 0.20 sample at P \u223c 2 GPa.

The suppression of the ordered moments below T c , which is observed in BaFe 2 (As 1\u2212x P x ) 2 , was also reported in Ba(Fe 1\u2212x Co x ) 2 As 2 by neutron scattering mea- surements and in Ba 1\u2212x K x Fe 2 As 2 by \u00b5SR measurements.   The competition between the magnetic and SC order pa- rameters as well as the spatial coexistence are common fea- tures of the \"122\" compounds.It thus seems that the re- lationship between the magnetic and SC phases is differ- ent between the \"1111\" and \"122\" compounds. The spatial coexistence is also realized in heavy-fermion superconduc- tors, whereas the nature of coexistence differs from that in BaFe 2 (As 1\u2212x P x ) 2 , i.e., magnetism and superconductivity oc- cur at different parts of the Fermi surfaces. For example, it was reported that the spatial coexistence is observed microscopi- cally in CeCo(In 1\u2212x Cd x ) and CeRhIn 5 at a certain pres- sure, where T N is higher than T c .  In these compounds, the magnetically ordered moments develop below T N ; how- ever, they become constant below T c without further change at low temperatures.  This suggests that magnetism and su- perconductivity emerge from different parts of the Fermi sur- faces, thus a single 4 f state could satisfy the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity. The suppression of the or- dered moments below T c was not observed in the U-based su- perconductor UPd 2 Al 3 or UNi 2 Al 3 , where plural 5 f electrons are subdivided into localized and itinerant electrons. This is also the case in ferromagnetic superconductors, such as UGe 2 , URhGe, and UCoGe. In contrast, the suppres- sion of the ordered moments below T c can be well understood by the assumption that the same Fermi surfaces contribute to both magnetic ordering and superconductivity with a compet- itive relationship.In BaFe 2 (As 1\u2212x P x ) 2 , cylindrical Fermi surfaces, particularly hole Fermi surfaces, are modified to be more three-dimensional, and nesting between hole and elec- tron Fermi surfaces becomes weaker with P substitution, re- sulting in the suppression of the AFM order.It is considered that the nesting vector becomes distributed and the AFM or- der (superconductivity) occurs at stronger (weaker) nesting vectors.In this regard, the competitive relationship between the two phases might have a common aspect with that in cuprate superconductors, whose AFM order is induced by the applied strong magnetic field that imposes the vortex lat- tice."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

One main topic was the evolution of the Fermi surface by doping . While this momentum resolved information attainable with the resolving power of new analysers enabled a lot of insight into details of the electronic structure, a class of models like t-J-, Hubbard-model, and others yield results without explicit momentum resolution. Here the evolution of the spectral density at E F , which in this paper is used synonymously with density of states, is treated without explicit k- resolution. While numerous studies exist, which cover only a limited doping range and enable a comparison to the above quoted theories just in this restricted range, we found just two publications covering the entire doping range . The focus of these studies on the La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO)-system was the underdoped range, where effects due to the pseudogap and the spectral weight renormalization were discussed for the occupied DOS.  Interestingly in the overdoped range the DOS at E F was found to converge to a constant value and a similar trend was observed by Romberg et al. for the unfilled DOS by EELS. Although the authors did not explicitly comment on this, in a naive view one would expect an increasing DOS with increasing hole concentration. Since the optimum doping regime with highest T c can be approached by doping from both sides, we found a strong demand for a comparative study on a different compound covering for the first time the occupied and the unoccupied DOS, to see whether the evolution of the DOS follows a common trend. One of the main research topics for HTC's is to find such universal properties like the pseudogap behaviour or, more general, the basic physics underlying the phase diagram."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This problem is more complex for the La-doped Bi-2201 system since there is doping by replacement of Sr-and Bi-ions by La-and Pb- ions, respectively, and additionally hole doping by changes of the oxygen content in the material, all of which can affect the doping level of the CuO 2 sheets. Therefore, at least, methods for determining solely the oxygen content such as iodine titration or thermogravimetry are not sufficient for this system. These difficulties can in principle be overcome by measurements of the Hall coefficient respectively thermopower. Since R H is temperature dependent and must be normalized to equal volume and number of Cu- atoms, a quantitative calculation of R H is intricate. An example of the necessary procedures is given in . The authors investigated different HTC's at optimum (highest T c ) hole concentration and found R H (T) to show similar values at room temperature when properly normalized.  From this it was concluded, that a comparison of room temperature R H values of various HTC's at different doping levels to LASCO data at room temperature is the best choice. Furthermore and apart from the considerations of this study it can be stated, that the effective carrier concentration measured by the Hall effect must not be identical to the carrier concentration in the CuO 2 -planes . From these reasons we have chosen a more straightforward way by analysing the Cu L 3 - absorption edge. This method has been used for LSCO and n = 2 and n = 3 Bi-based cuprates and is a direct measure of the carrier concentration in the CuO 2 -planes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Besides the occupied density of states at the Fermi level, extracted from photoemission (PES) data, an additional goal of this paper is the unoccupied density of states. For this, detailed investigations of the O K-edge have been performed.A comparison of the O 1s absorption edges of n = 1, 2, and 3 BSCO can be found in M\u00fcller et al. .

In contradiction to this assumption there are hints already in this previous experiment which will be confirmed here by a large number of measured samples that for hole overdoping the intensity of the prepeak is not further increasing but saturating.Therefore an alternative explanation of the origin of the O 1s prepeak consistent with all observations has to be found."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The change of D(E F ) with increasing hole concentration can then be interpreted in relation to the evolution of the Fermi surface with doping studied in detail for LSCO . In lightly-doped cuprates the density of the states at the Fermi level is found to be formed by so-called \"Fermi arcs\" , which build up part of the hole-like Fermi surface around the nodal directions, i.e. (0,0) -(\u03c0,\u03c0) and equivalents, of the Brillouin zone.  It should be mentioned that the Fermi arcs are due to a small sharp peak crossing E F in the nodal direction, but is observed until yet only in the second Brillouin zone . In addition, these first time observations have to be confirmed in other single-layer cuprates, like e.g. n = 1 BLSCO.  The spectral weight due to the arcs increases with hole doping in line with the D(E F ) increase of the underdoped regime shown in comparison.On the other hand, the flat band around the anti-nodal (0,0) -(\u03c0,0) direction of the Brillouin zone, located for low hole concentrations well below E F , gradually moves up to E F with increasing hole doping for LSCO . In addition for LSCO with stronger overdoping the energy gap around (\u03c0,0) closes and an electron-like Fermi surface is formed at p = 0.30.  In principle, from such a closed electron-like Fermi surface constant density of states D(E F ) could be expected, although a similar closure has not been observed in BISCO yet. For our polycrystalline samples a maximum hole concentration of p = 0.22 was obtained.  It can be speculated, that for the single crystalline samples of BISCO used in angular resolved photoemission studies for Fermi surface mapping a similar limiting value exists, which is decisively below the value of p = 0.30 for LSCO, so that the LSCO is more heavily overdoped.Also different in n = 1 BSLCO is that the constant D(E F ) begins already at about optimum doping of p = 0.16 and p = 0.17 for Pb-doped and Pb-free samples, respectively.For optimum hole doping, the flat band around the anti- nodal direction of the band structure is certainly below E F and can therefore not be the explanation for a constant D(E F )."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This can be seen as hint to the consistency of the interpretation of our data in form of density of states at the Fermi level derived from the filled and unfilled side of E F . Previously, the prepeak of the O K-edge was interpreted in a straight forward manner as reflecting the hole concentration directly . If this would be true a similar intensity behavior of the prepeak would be expected as the oxygen ligand line at the Cu L 3 -edge, i.e. one would expect a continuous increase in the underdoped as well as in the overdoped regime. Clearly, the experimental results are contradictory to this and an alternative explanation of the origin of the O 1s prepeak has to be found. Now the results of the LSCO single layer system from literature should be compared with that of BSLCO of the present work. shows the density of states at the Fermi level derived from PES on La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 by Ino et al. and Yoshida et al. .   In agreement with BSLCO, in both experiments on LSCO D(E F ) increases continuously for low doping and reveals a plateau for the overdoped region.In addition to this, also the unoccupied states derived by Romberg et al. from electron energy-loss spectroscopic (EELS) investigations of the O 1s prepeak reveal a similar increase of the intensity and, in principle, also the plateau in line with our XAS data and the PES results discussed above, although they studied only one overdoped sample (see ).  Romberg et al. draw two lines to their data points, one solid line following the evolution of the data point by point and a second dashed straight line indicating a linear relationship between hole doping and prepeak intensity. According to the large number of data of the overdoped regime discussed here, for BSLCO as well as LSCO, we can now conclude that the linear increase is wrong and that the evolution into constant density of states for overdoped single layer cuprates is established. This result, on the other hand, needs a better interpretation for the origin of the O 1s prepeak than simply a count of holes in the CuO 2 -plane. An explanation could be that besides the localized holes on Cu sites, upon doping two types of holes are introduced into the samples both located in the CuO 2 -planes.  Both types of doped holes determine the intensity of the oxygen ligand line at the Cu L 3 -edge but only one type determines the intensity of the prepeak of the O K-edge.The O 1s prepeak has been called \"mobile carrier peak\" by Abbamonte et al. .Thus we would suggest that it are the \"mobile holes\" which are measured by the O 1s prepeak intensity and which are responsible for the superconductivity of the CuO 2 -planes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

From these data the quasi- particle density of states (DOS) in the mixed state is derived and compared to the predicted scaling law C vol /T \u221a H = f (T / \u221a H) of d-wave superconductivity. It is found that the scaling law can be nicely followed by the optimally doped sample (x=0.15) in quite wide region of (T / \u221a H \u2264 8K/ \u221a T ). However, the region for this scaling becomes smaller and smaller towards more underdoped region: a clear trend can be seen for samples from x= 0.15 to 0.069. Therefore, generally speaking, the scaling quality becomes worse on the underdoped samples in terms of scalable region of T / \u221a H.  This feature in the underdoped region is explained as due to the low energy excitations from a sec- ond order (for example, anti-ferromagnetic correlation, d-density wave, spin density wave or charge density wave order) that may co-exist or compete with superconductivity.Surprisingly, deviations from the d-wave scaling law have also been found for the overdoped sample (x=0.22). While the scaling law is reconciled for the overdoped sample when the core size effect is taken into account.  An important discovery of present work is that the zero-temperature data follow the Volovik's relation \u2206\u03b3(T = 0) = A \u221a H quite well for all samples investigated here although the applicability of the d-wave scaling law to the data at finite temperatures varies with doped hole concentration. Finally we present the doping dependence of some parameters, such as, the residual linear term \u03b30, the \u03b1 value, etc. It is suggested that the residual linear term (\u03b30T ) of the electronic specific heat observed in all cuprate superconductors is probably due to the inhomogeneity, either chemical or electronic in origin. The field induced reduction of the specific heat in the mixed state is also reported.Finally implications on the electronic phase diagram are suggested."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This has been supported by tremen- dous experiments 1 both from surface detection 2,3,4,5,6 and bulk measurements . In a d-wave su- perconductor with line nodes in the gap function, the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) N (E) rises linearly with energy at the Fermi level in zero field, i.e., N (E) \u221d |E \u2212 E F |, resulting in 15 an electronic specific heat C e = \u03b1T 2 , where \u03b1 \u221d \u03b3 n /T c and \u03b3 n is the specific heat which is proportional to the DOS at the Fermi level of the nor- mal state.  In the mixed state with the field higher than a certain value, the DOS near the Fermi surface becomes finite, therefore the quadratic term C e = \u03b1T 2 will be surpassed and substituted by both the localized excita- tions inside the vortex core and the de-localized excita- tions outside the core. pointed out that for d- wave superconductors in the mixed state, supercurrents around a vortex core lead to a Doppler shift to the quasi- particle excitation spectrum, which affects strongly the low energy excitation around the nodes. It was shown that the contribution from the delocalized part (outside the core) will prevail over the core part and the specific heat is predicted to behave as C vol = k\u03b3 n T H/H c2 with k in the order of unity.  This prediction has been ver- ified by many measurements which were taken as the evi- dence for d-wave symmetry .In the finite temperature and field region a scaling law is proposed as with T / \u221a H \u2264 T c / H c2 (0). This scaling law can be further converted into the form of C vol /H = g(T / \u221a H) or C vol /T 2 = y(T / \u221a H), here f (x), or g(x) or y(x) are unknown scaling functions. This scaling law has been proved in Y BCO and in LSCO. It remains however unclear whether this scaling law is still valid in the very overdoped region since the vortex core size \u03be grows up.  In the underdoped region, inelastic neu- tron scattering reveals that an anti-ferromagnetic order emerges when the superconductivity is suppressed . It is thus also interesting to check whether the d-wave scaling law proposed by Simon and Lee is applicable in underdoped regime. In addition, the Simon-Lee scaling law is in agreement with the calculations as proposed by in two extreme conditions of temperature. In the low temperature limit the scaling law C vol /T 2 = y(T / \u221a H) becomes the Volovik's relation C vol = AT \u221a H. When the temperature is increased, an- other relation C \u221d aT 2 + bH is reached. The boundary between these two regions is T / \u221a H = T c / \u221a H c2 accord- ing to Volovik and Kopnin .These theoretical models can be quantitatively tested by experiments on samples with different doping concentrations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Part of the data for all samples will be presented, for example the field induced change of \u03b3 at zero K, the residual lin- ear term \u03b3 0 and the \u03b1 value in the pure d-wave ex- pression C DOS = \u03b1T 2 when H = 0 (see later). How- ever for clarity we mainly show data and the analysis on three typical samples with x=0.22 (T c = 27.4K, over- doped), x=0.15 (T c = 36.1K, close to optimal doping point) and p=0.069 (T c \u2248 12K, underdoped, x=0.063 originally) as characterized by AC susceptibility and DC magnetization (shown by the insets in and main panel of ).      The quality of our samples has also been characterized by x-ray diffraction patterns, and R(T ) data showing a narrow transition \u2206T c \u2264 2 K. For some samples, the full width at the half maximum (FWHM) of the rocking curve of the (008) peak is only 0.10 \u2022 .The overdoped sample has a mass about 28.55 mg and 3.66 \u00d7 2.3 \u00d7 0.5mm 3 in dimension. The opti- mally doped sample weighs about 23.6 mg with dimen- sions of 3.1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 0.5mm 3 .For the underdoped sample with nominal concentration x=0.063, before annealing, it has a superconducting transition temperature of about 12 K and a mass of about 32.89mg and 3.75 x 2.75 x 0.5mm 3 in dimensions. By fitting to the empirical rela- tion T c /T max c = 1 \u2212 82.6(p \u2212 0.16) 2 with T max c = 38K the maximum T c at the optimal doping point p = 0.16, we estimate that the hole concentration of this sample is around p = 0.069.After annealing in flowing Ar gas for 48h, the T c drops down from about 12 K to 9 K indi- cating that the sample becomes more underdoped.Note that T c =9 K is expected exactly by the empirical relation at x = p = 0.063."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The inset shows the diamagnetic transition at around 27.4 K de- termined by the crossing point of the extrapolating line of the most steep part with the normal state background M = 0.  In low temperature region the curves are rather linear showing that the major part is due to phonon contribu- tion C ph = \u03b2T 3 + \u03b4T 5 .It is known that the phonon part is independent on the magnetic field, this allows to remove the phonon contribution by subtracting the C/T at a certain field with that at zero field. The results af- ter the substraction are shown in . The subtracted values \u2206\u03b3 = \u03b3(H) \u2212 \u03b3(0) = [C(T, H) \u2212 C(T, H = 0)]/T exhibit a rather linear T dependence in low temperature region. One can also see that the negative slope is actu- ally field dependent. In the following we will show that the field dependent slope of the linear part in low tem- perature region shown in directly deviates from the Simon-Lee 18 scaling law. According to Simon-Lee scaling law C vol /T \u221a H = f (T / \u221a H), in low temperature region, the Volovik's rela- tion restores, thus one has C vol /T = A \u221a H and further has This clearly shows that there is a negative slope for \u2206\u03b3 vs. T , but the slope \u03b1 is a constant. However, from one can see that the slope changes slightly with the magnetic field H. This indicates that only the Volovik's relation is not enough to interpret the data. In the fol- lowing we will take both the core size effect and finite temperature effect into account. The former has not been considered in the original Simon-Lee scaling law since the size of the vortex core was thought to be small, and the contribution from that small region is negligible. If the vortex core size becomes bigger, this should be reconsid- ered when counting the DOS due to the Doppler shift effect."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

A linear behavior is clearly seen in low temperature region with a field dependent slope, which is not in accord with the pro- posed scaling law by Simon and Lee (see text). The straight lines in low temperature region are guides to the eyes. From these lines one can determine the zero temperature intercept \u2206\u03b3 and the slope d\u2206\u03b3/dT shown in Fig.5 low temperature limit and high temperature limit sug- gested by Volovik and Kopnin 21 , making Taylor's expan- sion to the right hand side of Simon-Lee scaling law leads to where b 0 = 0 because C vol /T should not diverge when T = 0 and H = 0, b1 = A. Since o(T 3 ) is very small in low temperature region, one thus has Interestingly, one can see that this simple formula contains the results both in the low tempera- ture limit C vol = b 1 T \u221a H 15,16,31 and high temperature limit 21,31 C vol = b 2 T 2 . This is not surprising since a scaling function should be more general and cover most possible cases. When H c1 << H << H c2 , the total spe- cific heat contains four parts: Doppler shift term from the region outside the core C vol , the inner vortex core term C core \u221d HT , the residual linear term \u03b3 0 T and the phonon term C ph .  Here it is assumed that the heat ca- pacity contributed by the core region is equal for each vortex and independent on the external magnetic field, thus C core depends only on the vortex density which is proportional to H. The local DOS measured by STM 26 revealed that the low energy DOS within the vortex core differs only slightly from the case for a d-wave supercon- ductivity (outside and far away from the vortex core). When changing the external magnetic field, the low en- ergy DOS within the vortex core is not expected to vary too much. At zero field, the total specific heat contains three parts: \u03b3 0 T and C ph , and a quadratic term \u03b1T 2 due to the thermal excitation near the nodal region.

This is actually reasonable since the vortex core with size \u03be \u221dhv F /\u2206 s grows up in the overdoped side due to smaller supercon- ducting gap value 32 , where v F is the Fermi velocity and \u2206 s is the superconducting gap. By taking the vortex core size (2\u03be) into account, i.e., deducting the normal core area away from the Volovik term, one can rewrite \u2206\u03b3 as where \u03be is the radius of the normal core, R a is the outer radius of a single vortex where the supercurrent is flowing, thus R 2 a = \u03c6 0 /\u03c0H. Reorganizing all terms in eq.6 leads to One can see that the third term in eq.7 is just what we need for interpreting the difficulty as mentioned above. It is necessary to recall that the core size correction is pro- portional to \u03be 2 , for example, it will be four times when \u03be doubles. Thus increase of \u03be in the overdoped side will give sizable effect on the total DOS and core size effect should be considered. Next let us have a closer inspec- tion at the data and derive some parameters. At zero temperature, only the first term and the last term are left in eq.7. The values of \u2206\u03b3(T = 0) are determined from the extrapolation of the linear lines in to 0 K and presented in . The data \u2206\u03b3(H, T = 0) is also determined by doing linear fit to the raw data C/T vs. T 2 between 2K and 4K, and then subtracted the zero temperature value \u03b3 0 . The results are quite close to each other by using these two different methods. The solid line in is a fit to the data using the first term in eq.7 yielding b1 = 1.995 \u00b1 0.046mJK \u22122 T \u22121/2 and \u03c0\u03be 2 /\u03c6 0 = 0.012 \u00b1 0.003 and thus \u03be = 28.2\u00c5. The value \u03be = 28\u00c5 derived here is quite close to that found in Nernst 33 and STM measurements 26 (20\u00c5 for opti- mally doped Bi-2212 sample). We also tried to use the first term together with the last term to fit the data but find out that the contribution from the last term is extremely small. The first term here describes the zero temperature data very well, indicating the absence of a second component of order parameter such as id xy or is since otherwise the Fermi surface would be fully gapped and the Doppler shift had very weak effect on the quasiparticle excitations. The inset of shows the field dependence of the slope of the linear part in . It is clear that the slope increases roughly lin- early with H above 1 T. This can be exactly anticipated by the second and third terms in eq.7. From the in- set of By tak- ing \u03be = 28.2\u00c5, we obtain the following values: \u03b1 = 0.501mJmol \u22121 K \u22123 and b 2 = 0.196mJmol \u22121 K \u22123 . The value of \u03b1 = 0.501mJmol \u22121 K \u22123 found here is quite close to the value obtained by fitting the zero field data to eq.2 (0.465 mJ/molK 2 see . Since the contribution from the core region (last term in eq.7) is negligible com- paring to the Volovik term, from eq.7 one understands that the failure of using the Simon-Lee scaling law in very overdoped sample is due to the core size effect. This is actually quite reasonable since the core size in the over- doped region grows up. Sofar we don't know yet whether the negligible contribution from the core region is because of the gapped feature within the core region as found in optimally and underdoped samples , or it is naturally small comparing to the contributions from the Doppler shift effect of the surrounding superfluid. This casts a interesting issue for future STM measurement on the tunnelling spectrum within the vortex cores in very overdoped region."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We have been aware that Nohara et al. successfully used the Simon-Lee scaling law to the overdoped sample x = 0.19, but failed for the optimally doped one.  The failure of using Simon-Lee scaling law in Nohara's experiment for opti- mally doped sample is in contradiction with the reports from many other groups . This may be caused by the way that they used to derive \u2206\u03b3. As stressed in pre- vious subsection, we use \u2206\u03b3 = [C H||c \u2212 C H=0 ]/T instead of using \u2206\u03b3 = [C H||c \u2212 C H\u22a5C ]/T to derive the field in- duced change of \u03b3. The latter (as used by Nohara et al.) may inevitably involve the unknown DOS contributions from another kind of vortices (for example, Josephson vortices) when H \u22a5 C. For La \u2212 214 system, since the Schottky anomaly is very week, it is not necessary to derive \u2206\u03b3 in the second way. While Nohara et al. ob- tained a relatively good scaling for the overdoped sample (x = 0.19). We would not comment on the validity of this successful scaling at x = 0.19. One reason for the discrepancy between their results and our results may be from different doping levels: our sample (x = 0.22) is more overdoped and the vortex core size is certainly larger and needs to be corrected ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Us- ing C vol /T = k\u03b3 n H/H c2 , we have k\u03b3 n = 0.577 \u221a H c2 . A similar value (0.49) was derived by Fisher et al. for La\u2212214 sample with x = 0.15. Taking H c2 \u2248 100T 32 and k \u2248 0.74 17 , we have \u03b3 n \u2248 7.8mJ/molK 2 , which is very close to the reported values for optimally doped La \u2212 214 sample . Worthy of noting here is that the field in- duced extra DOS at zero K can be nicely fitted with the Volovik's relation C vol \u221d T \u221a H albeit the residual linear term \u03b3 0 is quite large. This suggests that the residual linear term \u03b3 0 observed commonly in curate supercon- ductors may originate from some other properties, such as inhomogeneity. It may not be induced by the small scale impurity scattering since otherwise the H 1/2 law should not be followed so well.

The bottom curve is the real part x \u2032 of the ac susceptibility, and the upper one is the imaginary part x \u2032\u2032 . By extrapolating the most steep transition portion of the real part of the AC susceptibility to the normal state background (x \u2032 = 0), the Tc = 12K is determined here. The inset shows the DC magnetization measured in the FC and ZFC processes.   Below about 7.5 K, the magnetization measured in FC mode is rather stable. The slight temperature dependence of the magnetization measured in ZFC mode is induced by the flux penetration. showing that the major part is due to the phonon con- tribution C ph = \u03b2T 3 + \u03b4T 5 , and has no slight upturn in low temperature region due to the Schottky anomaly of free spins.The curve at zero field extrapolates to a finite value (\u03b3 0 ) at 0K , again showing the existence of a residual linear term which will be discussed later. As mentioned before the phonon part is independent on the magnetic field, this allows to remove the phonon contri- bution by subtracting the C/T at a certain field with that at zero field, one has \u2206C = C(H) \u2212 C(0) = C vol \u2212 \u03b1T 2 and \u2206C/T 2 = C vol /T 2 \u2212 \u03b1.  The results after the sub- straction are shown in .  One can see that the linear part with negative slope as appearing for the overdoped sample is absent here.This is understandable when \u03b1 value (or \u03b1T 2 term) is very small comparing to the field induced change of total specific heat. Therefore for this underdoped sample, no apparent T 2 term at H = 0 was observed which can be found easily in the overdoped LSCO sample. This is consistent with the data shown in I and experimental results from other groups on LSCO . The disappearance of this \u03b1T 2 term was usu- ally interpreted as due to either the impurity scattering which smears out the nodal effect, or the small value of coefficient \u03b1 of the T 2 term.  We will show that this is induced by much smaller \u03b3 n value (thus smaller \u03b1) just above T c . Next let us have a look at the field induced DOS at T=0 K.The data \u2206\u03b3(H, T = 0) is determined by doing linear fit to the raw data C/T vs. T 2 between 2K and 4K, and then subtracted the zero temperature value \u03b3 0 .The results are shown in .In order to compare with"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

While quite surpris- ingly, for many samples with quite different \u03b3 0 values, it is found that the zero temperature data can be expressed as \u03b3(H, T = 0) = \u03b3 0 + A \u221a H, showing evidence for d- wave pairing. This may suggest that \u03b3 0 is not mainly induced by the impurity scattering, since otherwise the field induced extra DOS should not follow the relation \u2206C(H, T = 0)/T = A \u221a H so well. In Fig.21, we present the field dependence of \u2206\u03b3 = [C(H, T = 0) \u2212 C(0, T = 0)]/T normalized to the value for each sample at about 12 T. Meanwhile we show the H 1/2 law by the solid line. One can see that for almost all samples, the field induced extra DOS at zero K follows the H 1/2 relation reason- ably well despite the \u03b3 0 value highly disperses. This fea- ture was also discovered by Chen et al. 14 on three typical samples (x = 0.10, 0.16 and 0.22). Nohara et al. mea-sured three single crystals (x = 0.10, 0.16 and 0.19) and empirically found that the optimally doped sample (x = 0.16) has the lowest value of \u03b3 0 (\u03b3 0 =2.8, 1.5 and 2.2 mJmol \u22121 K \u22122 for x=0.10, 0.16 and 0.19 respectively ob- tained from of Ref. ). Chen et al. 14 found the simi- lar behavior among three samples with x = 0.10, 0.16 and 0.22 (\u03b3 0 =1.49, 0.7 and 1.41 mJmol \u22121 K \u22122 respectively).   This raises the question of the origin of this residual linear term and its correlation with the field induced quasipar- ticle DOS. As mentioned before, if the field induced DOS is related to the impurity scattering, another relation 30 \u03b4\u03b3/\u03b3 0 = P 1 (H/P 2 )log(P 2 /H) is expected.This is some time contradicting to the experimental result (see dotted line in the main panel of ). In addition, the \u221a H dependence of the field induced change of \u03b3 is certainly not obtained by accident, since it is found on different samples from different groups, even on poly-crystalline samples . From the point of view of chemistry it is not true that the optimally doped sample is the clean- est one since in most cases the underdoped samples can be more easily grown with high quality.  In this sense the residual linear term may be related to some other properties rather than the impurity scattering.In the \u03b3 0 values for different single crystals measured in our experiment from underdoped to overdoped are shown. The value of \u03b3 0 is obtained by fitting zero field data to eq.2 (see . It is clear that the minimum \u03b3 0 is found in the region around 0.11 or 0.125. The value for \u03b3 0 found from our data are more close to the data of Nohara et al. on single crystals, but clearly higher than that obtained on polycrystalline smples 14 . So far we don't know the reason for this discrepancy. For our extremely underdoped sample (x = 0.063) investigated here, although the data at finite temperatures cannot be treated with the Simon-Lee scaling law, the data in the low temperature limit T \u2192 0 can be however still nicely expressed by \u03b3(H, T = 0) = \u03b3 0 + A \u221a H, even the ab- solute increase of \u03b3(H, T = 0) by field is much smaller than \u03b3 0 . Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the field induced part is mainly contributed by the Doppler shift effect on the supercurrent outside the vortex cores, while the residual linear term \u03b3 0 is mainly contributed by some small normal regions which weakly depends on the magnetic field. Similar explanations to the origin of \u03b3 0 have been suggested for many times in the past .  This may be understood in the following way. In un- derdoped Bi \u2212 2212 single crystals, scanning-tunneling- microscopic (STM) measurement indeed reveal a mixture of superconducting regions with sharp quasiparticle co- herent peaks on the tunnelling spectrum, and the non- superconducting regions with pseudogap-like tunneling spectrum 50 . In the overdoped side, the tiny normal cores as proposed in the Swiss cheese model 51 , or the mesoss- copic normal regions suggested by Fukuzumi et al. and Wen et al. will contribute a residual term \u03b3 0 which does not show an apparent increase with the field. As pro- posed by Fukuzumi et al. that the dome-like electronic phase diagram may be formed by the mixture of three phases: anti-ferromagnetic phase in the extremely under- doped region, a d-wave superconducting region with the robust superconductivity near the optimal doping point and a non-superconducting Fermi liquid in the overdoped region. According to this simple picture the \u03b3 0 should in- crease in the underdoped and overdoped region, which is just the case as shown by the data in .Therefore we would argue that the residual linear term may be mainly contributed by some non-superconducting regions due to phase separation, either chemical or electronic in origin.This interesting argument needs certainly to be further checked with data obtained by different techniques on different systems."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This is also the temperature region that most of the low temper- ature specific heat data was reported in the literatures. Now we report another phenomenon: field induced re- duction of specific heat in the mixed state.  In we present the temperature dependence of the field (12T) induced change of \u03b3 for three typical samples analyzed above, here \u2206\u03b3 = [C(12T ) \u2212 C(0T )]/T . Although the data are strongly scattered one can still see that: (1) The field induced change \u2206\u03b3 becomes negative at about 0.5 \u2212 0.7T c ; (2) The curves have a similar shape: \u2206\u03b3 is positive in low temperature region, then it becomes neg- ative and finally comes back to zero in high temperature region (near T c for optimal and overdoped sample). For the overdoped sample, the \u2206\u03b3 keeps negative above 0.5T c until T c at which \u2206\u03b3 suddenly goes back to zero. For the optimally doped one, the \u2206\u03b3 is negative above about 0.7T c up to the highest temperature we measured here .  However for the underdoped sample, it shows that the \u2206\u03b3 keeps negative until 1.5T c .Similar data were obtained by Fisher et al. on samples with x = 0.15. Our data near T c is more scattered since our setup can only measure samples with maximum mass of 50 mg.  This feature, namely the negative \u2206\u03b3 in high temper- ature region is a consequence of entropy consideration, which has been observed in all types of superconductors. In low temperature region, when a magnetic field is ap- plied, vortices will be generated leading to higher DOS near Fermi surface, so that \u2206\u03b3 = \u03b3(H) \u2212 \u03b3(0) is posi- tive. When the temperature is increased, to satisfy the field independent entropy above T c , in a certain region below T c , \u2206\u03b3 should be negative. The most interest- ing point is for the underdoped sample here, even above T c one clearly sees a magnetic field induced change of entropy. This implies an abnormal normal state which is far from a conventional metal.   For a conventional s- wave superconductor, the field induced change of \u03b3 can be negative near T c . It is difficult to understand the field induced reduction of specific heat well below T c , since the normal core region always gives rise to a higher DOS of quasiparticle.Outside the vortex core the DOS is almost negligible. However this field induced reduction of spe- cific heat well below T c is found to be a general feature of all LSCO crystals we investigated so far. This may be related to the intrinsic properties of cuprate super- conductors.  In a d-wave superconductor, theoretically it is predicted that there is a ZBCP within the vortex core which should also contribute a quite high DOS in the mixed state.   Besides, a high DOS will be generated by the Doppler shift effect of the supercurrent surrounding the vortex core.Normally the sum of these two terms are larger than the zero-field term C DOS = \u03b1T 2 , leading to a field induced enhancement of DOS in low tempera- ture region.  When the temperature is high, the Doppler shift effect will be smeared out by the strong thermal ex- citation and finally \u2206\u03b3 becomes negative.As far as we know, no quantitative theoretical expression about \u2206\u03b3 has been reported so far for a d-wave superconductor in wide temperature region. We cannot have a quantitative understanding to our data.However, this field induced reduction of specific heat well below T c may be under- stood as due to the anomalous feature of vortex core state, i.e., a gapped vortex core as seen by the STM. , or based on the assumption that the contributions from the core region is much smaller than the outside region where either the Doppler shift or the strong thermal ex- citation dominates.Actually the Simon-Lee scaling law becomes a C vol \u221d T 2 relation in high temperature re- gion.In this case the quasiparticle excitation outside the vortex core is almost the same (\u03b1T 2 ) with or without applying a magnetic field.However since the vortex core region is gapped or contributes negligible part to the to- tal DOS, one needs to take the core region away from the total area in calculating \u2206\u03b3, naturally leading to a negative value of \u2206\u03b3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

It is found that the field induced DOS of the optimally doped sample fits the predicted Simon-Lee scaling law for a d-wave superconductor very well, while deviations have been found for the overdoped sample. However, it is reconciled for the overdoped sample if one considers the core size effect provided the contribution from the inner vortex core is small comparing to that due to the Doppler shift in the same area. The Simon-Lee scaling law is applicable in the underdoped region only in very low temperature region. We attribute this to the ap- pearance of a second competing order (like AF or SDW or DDW) within and nearby the vortex core. The negli- gible contribution from the vortex core region may sug- gest the absence of the ZBCP in the vortex core, even in the overdoped region, although it is expected by the Bo- goliubov de-Gennes theory for a d-wave superconductor. Finally we present the doping dependence of the residual linear term \u03b3 0 commonly observed in cuprate supercon- ductors.  It is argued that this linear term may be related to inhomogeneity (either electronic or chemical), rather than be simply explained as due to the small scale im- purity scattering as usually thought. This conclusion is made because the field induced extra DOS at zero tem- perature follows the Volovik's \u221a H law reasonably well in all doping regime.

Both the A and B sublattices form a network of corner-sharing tetra- hedra such that it may not be possible to energetically satisfy all the magnetic interactions simultaneously. The resultant geometric frustration leads to the formation of exotic ground states. Much of the recent work has con- centrated on local moment systems where novel proper- ties such as cooperative paramagnetism , partial, non- collinear antiferromagnetic ordering , spin-freezing , and dipolar \"spin-ice\" behavior have been ob- served. There has, however, been growing interest in the interplay between itinerant and local moments in geo- metrically frustrated systems. The metallic pyrochlore Nd 2 Mo 2 O 7 exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect which has been attributed to the Berry phase produced by spin chirality on the pyrochlore lattice , while the spinel compound, LiV 2 O 4 has been claimed to represent the first known transition metal heavy-fermion system and evidence exists that the unusual properties of this mate- rial are related to geometrical frustration on the spinel lattice.  A vast body of work has been carried out on 3d and 4d transition metal pyrochlores.These are generally in- sulators and possess either a spin-glass-like or long-range ordered magnetic structure. In contrast, the 5d transition metal pyrochlores are mainly metallic, resulting from the extended nature of the 5d orbitals. The exception to this is Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 where the 5d 3 configuration of Os 5+ results in a half-filled t 2g band and a metal-insulator transition at 226 K. Despite the large number of transi- tion metal compounds which crystallize in the pyrochlore structure and the wide range of physical phenomena ob- served in these materials, superconductivity had not been observed until the recent discovery of bulk superconduc- tivity in the 5d pyrochlore, Cd 2 Re 2 O 7."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Recent inves- tigations have demonstrated the ex- istence of two phase transitions in this compound. The first, occurring at a temperature of about 200 K, is a continuous structural transition which is accompanied by drastic changes in resistivity and magnetic suscep- tibility .  On further lowering the temperature, Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 has been shown to exhibit bulk superconduc- tivity below a sample dependent transition temperature of about 1 K .Preliminary measurements in the superconducting state indicate that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is a type-II superconductor with H c1 less than 0.002 T and estimates of the upper critical field, H c2 , ranging from 0.2 T to 1 T .   None of the measurements reported to date extend below 0.3 K (T /T c \u223c0.3) and hence, little can be concluded about the symmetry of the order parameter in this system. An exponential form of the specific heat as T approaches zero was speculated by Hanawa et al. but they point out that measurements to lower temperatures are clearly needed. We report the first measurements on Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 below 300 mK, tem- peratures which are necessary (for T c \u223c 1 K) to extract information about the superconducting order parameter symmetry. We have performed transverse field (TF) and zero field (ZF) muon spin rotation (\u00b5SR) measurements on single crystal samples of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 .The ZF-\u00b5SR measurements reveal very small internal magnetic fields which are characteristic of nuclear dipoles, indicating no significant electronic magnetism either above or below T c . The TF-\u00b5SR results provide the first measurement of the internal field distribution in the vortex state in this material.In particular, temperature dependent studies from 20 mK to 4 K indicate a penetration depth which levels off as T \u2192 0, suggestive of a fully gapped Fermi surface with a rather large zero temperature value of the penetration depth, \u03bb(0)\u223c7500\u00c5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Also this J c value was nearly same order of magnitude as that ob- tained for powders using a sieve with the average size R \u2243 3 \u00b5m . The high-T c cuprate superconductors have strongly 2-dimensional characters, short coherence length, and 'high' T c .  Due to these, vortex lines become ill-defined and transform into pancake vortices confined within the CuO 2 planes, which couple only weakly be- tween the layers. Thus the critical current density suf- fers great decrease at higher temperatures due to the flux flow driven by a strong thermal fluctuation effect. There are several extrinsic methods to enhance J c . Correlated defect was known to increase the pinning at higher tem- peratures and high fields while point defects have been known to be efficient only at low temperature and low fields . The former such as columnar defects gen- erated by heavy-ion irradiation not only increases just pinning centers but also could be thought to increase the coupling between vortices along the irradiated trajectory. This is because the relatively strong pinning centers are produced along straight line across CuO 2 plane. The be- havior of J c of La-112 here resembles the former case, namely the critical current density does not decays fast as temperature and field increases. For example, at T \u223c T c/2, J c decreases by much less than factor of 2 when the field is increased from 1 and 4.5 Tesla, which is just typical behavior expected for Bean's critical state model . Correlated defects are generally inserted into the sample on purpose, surely absent in our samples. All these arguments suggest that the behavior of J c of our sample is highly intrinsic because Jorgensen et al. showed that defects, most probably the oxygen defects and va- cancies, do not exist for this compound ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The uniform size made the superconducting transition sharp in the low-field magnetization, and the cracks made the resistivity drop in the transport measurement nearly in- visible. Actually we tried to make samples without in- situ annealing after sintering. This sample showed many smaller grains between larger grains, which resulted in broad superconducting transition in the low-field mag- netization but with a clearer resistivity drop due to a better connectivity between the grains. These suggest that the use of grain radius not the sample radius is rea- sonable for the calculation of J c like the previous report .

Although strongly correlated systems are beyond the scope of the Kohn-Sham scheme of the DFT, many successful attempts have been made to deal with the description of superconducting materials. In particular, some specific properties of the normal state, e.g. electronic band dispersions and electronic density of states, are very useful to elucidate aspects of the superconducting mechanism and to predict relevant parameters, such as the critical temperature T c and the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb. In the last few years, an increasing number of studies appeared using this methodology, either as support for experimental discoveries or fully theoretical investigations . Superconductivity was recently experimentally reported, by some of the present authors, for the HfV 2 Ga 4 compound, with a critical temperature (T c ) of 4.1 K .   The investi- gators observed some deviations from the more conventional BCS theory signatures, such as an unusual inflection near T c in lower and upper critical field as a function of reduced temperature, and a second jump in the specific heat vs. temperature curve. The authors speculated that the experimental results could be either due to sample inhomogeneity or to the presence of more than one superconducting gap at the Fermi surface, resulting in a two-band superconductivity .These recent experimental results for the bulk HfV 2 Ga 4 point to a new promising class of materials to study unconventional superconducting behavior.   Motivated by these results, here we perform ab-initio electronic structure calculations for HfV 2 Ga 4 .We focus our atten- tion on the analysis of the possible mechanisms behind the superconducting properties.The theoretical study was extended to a new (possibly) bulk superconducting compound with the same prototype structure, ScV 2 Ga 4 , as a way to manipulate the electronic structure aiming at enhancing the superconducting transition temperature."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

An unusual overlapping of the \u03c1 a (T ) data for the \"60-K phase\" samples, which is clear in (a), has been discussed in Ref. . shows examples of the raw MR (\u2206\u03c1 a ) data for y=7.0. All the data plotted in show the ordinary H 2 depen- dence, which becomes clear in the plot of \u2206\u03c1 a vs H 2 []. In the underdoped samples, however, we ob- served that the MR starts to become concave downward (or tends to saturate) in the \u2206\u03c1 a vs H 2 plot upon ap- proaching T c , as shown in (d) for y=6.50 (T c =35 K).   Such H-dependence is most likely caused by a de- crease in the characteristic magnetic-field scale to sup- press superconducting fluctuations, and some vortex fluc- tuations in the pseudogap state are possibly in- volved in this anomaly.In any case, when this anomalous H-dependence is observed near T c , the MR data cannot be discussed on the same ground as those at higher tem- peratures, and therefore we do not include the MR data for temperatures very close to T c in the discussions after- wards. However, as long as the temperature is not very close to T c , the low-field part of \u2206\u03c1 a can reasonably be fitted with H 2 [as shown for the 50-K data in ] and for such data we determine the \"magnitude\" of MR from the low-field slope of the \u2206\u03c1 a vs H 2 plot. shows the summary of the transverse and lon- gitudinal MR ([\u2206\u03c1 a /\u03c1 a ] \u22a5 and [\u2206\u03c1 a /\u03c1 a ] / , respectively) for the whole doping range.

The solid lines in Figs. 4(a)-(c) are the fits of the data to the normal-state contribution. The data at high tempera- tures are actually very well fitted with the (aT 2 + b) \u22122 dependence. The offset b is zero for y of down to 6.60, but becomes non-zero for smaller y, which corresponds well to the behavior of the \u03c1 a (T ) data where a noticeable residual resistivity becomes apparent for y < 6.60 []; this seems to give additional support to the validity of this analysis.  The y-dependence of the fitting param- eters are summarized in . We note that the magneto-resistance is not as well fitted with (aT 2 + b) \u22122 as the magneto-conductance, which implies the necessity of the correct calculation for \u2206\u03c3 a /\u03c3 a .

It becomes clear in that, in addition to the general growth of the FMC with decreasing y, there is an enhancement in the FMC near y=6.7, which corresponds to the 60-K phase of YBCO; this means that the superconducting fluctuations are more easily suppressed with magnetic field and thus the characteristic field scale for supercon- ductivity is reduced near y=6.7."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In determining the dashed lines, there are two fitting parameters, the in-plane and c-axis coherence lengths, \u03be ab and \u03be c . (T c is set to the zero-resistance T c .)   Since the fits become in- sensitive to \u03be c for y < 6.9 where \u03be c 1\u00c5, for underdoped samples we fix \u03be c to be near 1\u00c5 and only change \u03be ab in the fits.

The general trend is that \u03be ab increases with decreasing hole doping, which is natural because the mean-field upper critical field at zero temperature,  ab )], is expected to be reduced as T c goes down. However, for y \u2243 6.7 there is a marked anomaly that \u03be ab deviates upwardly from the general trend, which corresponds to a suppression of H MF c2 in the 60-K phase []. This is in accord with the trend already ap- parent in .  We note that this implication on the upper critical field is actually corroborated by the behavior of the resistive transition in 16 T, where the 60-K-phase samples show a marked broadening compared to other compositions, as demonstrated in .There- fore, both \u03be ab and the resistive transition appear to indi- cate that the superconductivity is anomalously weak to the applied magnetic field in the region near y=6.7."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Since the weakening of the superconduc- tivity is the fundamental feature of the 1/8 anomaly in the La-based cuprates, the present result clearly speaks for the 1/8-anomaly origin of the 60-K plateau. Fur- thermore, comparisons of the Hall coefficient R H and a- axis thermopower S a of 60-K YBCO to those of LSCO at x=0.12 strongly suggest that the hole doping is in fact 1/8 for y \u2243 6.65; Figs. 6(b) and 6(c) show such comparisons in R H (T )e/V 0 (V 0 is the volume per Cu in the plane) and S a (T ), which demonstrate that LSCO at x=0.12 and YBCO at y \u2243 6.65 show quite similar val- ues near room temperature, and these parameters have been proposed to be good indicators of the hole doping in cuprates .      Therefore, it appears that in the 60-K plateau the hole doping is actually \u223c1/8 and the super- conductivity is weakened, which together mean that the 60-K plateau is a manifestation of the 1/8 anomaly.It is useful to note that a reasonably good case for the connec- tion between the plateau and the 1/8 anomaly was made previously in a complementary way, using Ca doping . It should however be noted that static charge stripes (a sort of charge density wave that localizes the carriers) do not appear to be the fundamental \"cause\" of the weak- ening of the superconductivity in YBCO, since there is no evidence for static stripes in YBCO.It is of course possible that the impact of the stripes at the 1/8 doping varies depending on the level of dynamics of the stripes in various cuprate systems.A more interesting possibil- ity is that a proximity to a quantum critical point (QCP) is the more fundamental cause of the 1/8 anomaly: Recently, Aeppli et al. reported that the magnetic response of the Nd-free LSCO (where there is also no ev- idence for static charge stripes) bears a signature of the quantum criticality.In our data, fluctuations seem to be enhanced near y=6.7 while the superconductivity is sup- pressed, which might also be an indication of a proximity to a QCP; if so, this particular QCP suppresses super- conductivity through enhanced fluctuations, rather than creates superconductivity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We have subsequently improved film quality by eliminating the interface between the film and substrate, by grow- ing PCCO films onto Pr 2 CuO 4 (PCO)/SrTiO 3 instead of directly onto SrTiO 3 .The insulating PCO layer is thought to lessen lattice mismatch between PCCO film and SrTiO 3 substrate, so that these films should be more homogeneous through their thickness.

Theoretical investigations of the dc as well as the finite-frequency conductivity dates from the 1960's, and development of this topic proceeded until the discovery of high temperature superconductors (HTSC's). High critical temperatures and short coher- ence lengths conspire to the giant enhancement of ther- modynamical fluctuations in HTCs. Due to their layered structure and to the consequent anisotropy in the su- perconducting state, the effects of thermal fluctuations are further enhanced. As a result, these materials can be viewed as ideal systems to experimentally verify the theories for the excess conductivity. Among the high- temperature compounds with moderate but significant anisotropy, YBCO is the most studied on this aspect, and we will restrict our discussion and measurements to this compound only. Despite the extended experimental investigation, there is a considerable debate on the appropriate model for the fluctuation conductivity in zero magnetic field: most of the existing analysis of the effects of order- parameter fluctuations on the dc conductivity have been performed in terms of Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) isotropic three-dimensional (3D) fluctuations 2 for temperatures close to T c , while a crossover to 2D fluctuations has been claimed at temperatures substantially higher than T c , according to the interpretation of the data in terms of Lawrence-Doniach (LD) model.  Not too close to T c , data on YBCO have been shown to be compatible with an AL interpretation supplemented with a Maki-Thompson (MT) term. However this framework has been seriously questioned by Hopfengartner et al : by extending the AL theory to an anisotropic superconductor and introducing a phenomenological cutoff for long wave-vector fluctu- ations they showed that the dc excess conductivity in YBCO films agreed well with the modified AL expres- sion, without the need for MT terms (up to T = 1.1 T c ).   Most important, from this kind of analysis no 3D-2D crossover was found in YBCO, in contrast with the ordi- nary LD-like crossover.These interpretations are based on theoretical results ob- tained in the Gaussian approximation. Approaching the critical region close to T c this treatment must be ex- tended to take into account interactions between fluc- tuations. The amplitude of the critical region is theoret- ically predicted to be experimentally accessible for these superconductors, but the actual value of the crossover temperature from Gaussian to critical behavior is still debated.  Up to now, the analysis of the dynamical properties near T c have been performed mainly through the compari- son of experimental data with appropriate power laws of the reduced temperature. However, experimental data give controversial results. For example, the dc conduc- tivity above T c 21 and the penetration depth \u03bb(T ) be- low T c 11 have been found to follow a 3D XY-like power law, but Gaussian results for \u03bb(T ) have been recently reported.Moreover, a possible crossover from critical to 2D Gaussian fluctuations has been reported in the mi- crowave conductivity.In fact, simple power laws or scal- ing behaviors, without explicit expressions for the vari- ous quantities, do not allow a quantitative and complete comparison between experiments and theories."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Five YBCO thin films, grown by different methods were investigated.  All samples were highly c-axis oriented, as indicated from the \u03b8 \u2212 2\u03b8 rocking curve. Twinning is largely present in all samples (as usual in films). Thicknesses ranged from 0.08 to 0.5 \u00b5m. The main features are presented in Table . It is worth mentioning that samples II and III are of inferior quality, as can be seen, e.g.,by the fact that the normal state resistivity is 2-3 times higher than in the other films. Microwave resistivity measurements were performed on as-deposited samples I-IV. The microwave response was investigated at 48 and 24 GHz, in samples I-III and IV, respectively.  Extensive descriptions of the experimen- tal systems have been given previously, and we give here only a short sketch.Two experimental systems were employed. In both cases we made use of the cavity-end- wall-replacement method: the sample is mounted in or- der to replace one end-wall of a mechanically tunable right-cilynder resonant cavity. The cavities were designed to work in absorption in the TE 011 mode, at 24 [cavity (a)] and 48.2 GHz [cavity (b)], with quality factors of about 15000 and 6000, respectively. The relatively low quality factor prevented an accurate measurement of the absolute surface resistance below \u223c 70K, but allowed us to obtain reliable measurements in the whole transition range and well above T c . As described in Ref. , the unloaded quality factor Q of the cavities was measured by recording the (Lorentzian) resonance shape as a func- tion of the slowly (\u223c 0.2 K/min) increasing temperature.  Changes of Q reflect the changes in the microwave sur- face resistance. A calibration of the cavity response is in principle needed to obtain the absolute surface resis- tance, but since below \u223c 70 K the changes in Q cannot be resolved due to the reduced sensitivity of the cavities, data presented as: are independent on the calibration (a detailed discus- sion can be found in Ref. ). This is equivalent to take as zero the low-temperature value of R S . Here G is a known geometrical factor. The real part of the microwave resistivity is directly ob- tained from the data due to the reduced sample thick- ness d. For samples thinner than twice the penetration depth (the skin depth \u03b4 in the normal state, the London penetration depth \u03bb in the superconducting state) the measured surface resistance directly gives the real part of the resistivity through: A detailed study of the applicability range of this ap- proximation can be found in Ref. . We notice, however, that we are interested in measurements close and above T c, where \u03bb is much longer than the zero-temperature value.Consequently, Eq.16 is valid up to (at least) 3%, 32 also in the thicker film."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

First of all, we write the total conduc- tivity as the sum of the normal and fluctuational terms, so that the total resistivity is given by where we have assumed that the normal state relax- ation time is much smaller than 1/\u03c9.  Here,\u03c3 f l (T, \u03c9) is the fluctuational conductivity and \u03c1 n (T ) is the measured normal-state resistivity. The latter is linear above \u223c120 K, and it was linearly extrapolated down to T c . Fits of the experimental data with the real part of Eq.17 can now be made.  The theoretical expression depends on four independent parameters, that can be chosen to be the bare \u03be ab0 , \u03bb ab0 and \u03b3, and the renormalized critical temperatureT c (which is, in this frame, the experimen- tally observable critical temperature).With the present interpretation, no information comes from the data for the bare critical temperature, T c .  Before commenting on the fits, a few notes should be added.  First of all, as common to many calculations of the fluctuational conductivity, 14 the theory overesti- mates the fluctuational contribution for T \u226b T c .This is true also at zero frequency.In fact, calculations of the dc excess conductivity in the Gaussian approxima- tion, explicitly including a high-q cutoff in the various integrations in the momentum space show a drastic and sharp suppression of\u03c3 (T, \u03c9 = 0) at sufficiently high T (above \u223c120 K for YBCO)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We mention that our data might be equally well fitted with the original isotropic theory . However in this case the parameters attain unrealistic values. As an example, on sample I one would get a fit with the isotropic theory almost indistinguishable from the one obtained with the anisotropic theory with \u03be = 2.6\u00c5. Since here \u03be is an isotropic coherence length, it is reasonable to assume \u03be = (\u03be 2 ab \u03be c ) 1/3 = \u03be ab /\u03b3 1/3 . For \u03be ab \u2248 15\u00c5 one would get \u03b3 \u2248 200, more than an order of magnitude higher than known values in YBCO.  The Gaussian anisotropic theory (Eq.8) can be made to fit the data only in the high part of the resistive transitions. An example is reported in the inset of Fig. It is apparent that the Gaussian approximation does not reproduce at all the shape of the resistive transition. A final note on the 3D-2D dimensional crossover that might be expected at high temperatures, owing to the decrease of the c-axis coherence length: being our calculation explicitly 3D, such a crossover is not included there. However, it seems that at least up to \u223c120 K the data are well described by the anisotropic 3D theory. This behavior is com- pletely analogous to the results obtained in dc, where a Gaussian analysis of the data sufficiently above T c did not show any dimensional crossover, the departure from the AL anisotropic 3D behavior being fully accounted for by the introduction of the cutoff in q-space. It would be consistent also with the fact that, on a pure numerical ground, the renormalized coherence length is longer than the bare one, so that the crossover temperature shifts to higher T , where this phenomenon might be hardly distin- guishable from the short-wavelength-fluctuation regime. This point deserves further study in the future."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Among the Fe-based superconductors, 11 type compounds have the simplest structure consisting only of superconducting layers.  On the other hand, the other Fe-based superconductors (111 type, 122 type, 1111 type, and so on) have a stacking structure with both superconducting layers and block layers. Thus, 11 type superconductors have been extensively studied in order to understand the mechanism of Fe-based superconductivity.    The 11 type superconductor FeSe exhibits superconductivity with T c = 13K and its T c reaches 37K under high pressure (4-6 GPa). The pressure dependence of T c relates to the anion height from the Fe layers , and T c of FeSe increases with decreasing anion (Se) height by high pressure.Thus, 11 type superconductors have the potential of achieving a high T c . Additionally, T c of K 0.8 Fe 2 Se 2, composed of K intercalation between FeSe layers, also shows an abrupt increase above 30 K .For (LiNH 2 ) x Fe 2 Se 2 , the superconductivity exhibits a higher T c of 43 K .     With an increase in the c lattice parameter and the separation between Fe-chalcogen layers, T c increases.Therefore, a change of Fe-chalcogen layer has a great impact on superconductivity.Recently, it was reported that a FeSe monolayer synthesized by MBE method shows superconductivity at 53 K . \uf073-GGA (spin-dependent generalized gradient approximation) calculations have predicted that a Dirac-cone state appears in a FeSe monolayer .The Dirac-cone states behind the superconducting state may substantially raise its T c .Furthermore, there are several reports where the T c of superconducting ultrathin films become higher than that of the bulk .Thus, an ultrathin film of 11 type compounds may show an abrupt increase in T c."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The normal-state resistivities for 65 and 100 nm slowly decreases with decreasing temperature while that for 15 nm and the bulk increases, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The broadening superconducting transition and the change from metallic to semiconducting behavior of each film are similar to the change of Fe 1+d Te 1-x Se x with increasing excess Fe composition .  Therefore, the increase of the resistivity corresponds to weak charge carrier localization due to the excess Fe, which results in the broadening of superconducting transition for 65 nm and the bulk. The existence of the excess Fe makes the crystal inhomogeneous.  Thus, the result for 100 nm, which shows metallic resistivity with sharpest \uf044T c , suggests that a homogeneous crystal with low excess Fe, originally part of the bulk, is cleaved and remains on the surface of the substrate incidentally. This indicates that a homogeneous crystal with low excess Fe can be obtained using the scotch-tape method and shows ideal superconductivity.On the other hand, the result for 65nm implies that a part of the crystal with some excess Fe remains on the substrate and its superconductivity is inhibited by the excess Fe.   For 15nm, a part of the crystal with a large excess of Fe remains and the superconductivity is completely suppressed and changes from metallic character to semiconductivity. Additionally, we determined the upper critical field H c2 (T) curves of the thin film with 100 nm thickness for H/c axis and the H/ab plane from the temperature dependence of the resistivity under a magnetic field.The temperature dependence of the resistivity under a magnetic field is summarized in Fig. 3 for (a) the H/c axis and (b) H/ab plane. The temperature at which the resistivity reached zero was systematically suppressed with increasing magnetic field.  We estimated H c2 (T) from the criterion of 90% of normal-state resistivity. From the comparison of H c2 (T) for the thin film with bulk, H c2 (T) curves of the thin film shift toward higher field than those of bulk.  Moreover, we calculated the H c2 ab (0) and H c2 c (0) using the data from 0 to 7T and Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory : H c2 ab (0) = 134.3 T and H c2 c (0) = 90.6 T for the thin film, and H c2 ab (0) = 87.9 T and H c2 c (0) = 39.2 T for the bulk. We also estimated the irreversibility field from the criterion of 10% of normal-state resistivity, as shown in Fig 3(d): H irr ab (0) = 102.6 T and H irr c (0) = 45.6 T for the film, and H irr ab (0) = 53.9 T and H irr c (0) = 27.7 T for the bulk. The H irr for the film are much larger than that of the bulk and the previous reports . The anisotropy coefficients \uf067 determined from \uf067 = H c2 ab (0)/ H c2 c (0) were estimated to be 1.5 for the thin film and 2.2 for the bulk, respectively. The anisotropy coefficient \uf067 of the thin film shows more isotropic behavior than that of the bulk.We found that the film with the lowest \uf044T c exhibits more isotropic \uf067, high H c2 and H irr . In previous reports, the bulk sample with low excess Fe shows low \uf044T c than high excess Fe .Excess Fe induces the broadening \uf044T c , worse superconducting properties, and more anisotropic behavior than ideal FeTe 1-x Se x .Therefore, our results indicate that ideal FeTe 1-x Se x bulk should exhibit high superconducting performance with isotropic superconductivity and has an advantage to application."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The chemistry and structure of Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u20221.35H 2 O, which consists of two triangular cobalt oxide sheets per unit cell separated by spacer layers of water molecules and sodium ions, as well as its apparent balance between magnetism and superconductivity, are similar to the cuprate high Tc superconductors.  Here we report the discovery of superconductivity in three-layer Na 0.30 CoO 2 \u22c51.3H 2 O, at a temperature of 4.3 K. Although essentially identical in chemical composition to the original two-layer superconductor, this superconductor is structurally distinct due to differences in the stacking of the CoO 2 sheets in the third dimension.The consequences of this kind of structural difference have not been pursued in the cuprate superconductors. The observation of superconductivity at the same critical temperature in both two- layer and three-layer sodium cobalt oxyhdrates suggests that the essential physics of these superconductors will be well described by theoretical models that consider the magnetic and electronic system to be essentially two-dimensional in nature."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

A 15% excess of NaOH pellets (EM Science, 97% minimum purity) and stiochiometric amounts of Co metal sponge (Johnson Matthey, Grade I) were mixed in a dense alumina crucible, followed by heating in O 2 at 500 degrees for 12 h. The fused mixture was ground and annealed at 800 degrees for 16 h in N 2 to yield a gray crystalline powder. The powder was then finely ground and treated with Br 2 concentration of 40x (1 x is the theoretical amount of Br 2 needed to remove all the Na in NaCoO 2 ) in CH 3 CN for 5 days. The product was washed in dry CH 3 CN and dried in an atmosphere of flowing argon. The Na content of the product was verified by neutron powder diffraction structural analysis and Inductive Coupled Plasma (ICP) analysis to give the formula Na 0.30 CoO 2 .  The structural analysis, to be reported elsewhere , showed that the O3 structure type was fully maintained on deintercalation of the sodium. The bromine concentration employed to get the correct Na content to yield superconductivity seems to be more critical in the case of three-layer Na x CoO 2 than in two-layer Na x CoO 2 .  Figure shows powder X-ray Diffraction patterns (Cu K\u03b1 radiation) of the three-layer compounds O3 NaCoO 2 , Na 0.30 CoO 2 , and the \"intermediate hydrate\" of three-layer O3 Na 0.30 CoO 2 . The overall chemical behavior of the three-layer system on deintercalation of Na and intercalation of water is very similar to that observed in the two-layer sodium cobaltate.The c lattice parameter of O3 NaCoO 2 expands on deintercalation of Na to Na 0.3 CoO 2 , as is also seen on deintercalation of two-layer P2 Na 0.7 CoO 2 .    Similar to the case for P2 Na 0.7 CoO 2 , an intermediate hydrate is obtained in the O3 system by drying a water washed sample of Na 0.30 CoO 2 at room temperature. In the intermediate hydrates (also called \"monolayer hydrates\"), the water molecules are in the same layer as the sodium ions, increasing the c-axis of Na 0.30 CoO 2 due to their larger size.The new superconducting superhydrate (also called \"bilayer hydrate\", two layers of water molecules are found between the CoO 2 sheets) in the three-layer cobaltate was synthesized by exposing anhydrous O3 Na 0.30 CoO 2 to water vapor in a humidity chamber with 100% relative humidity at room temperature for 1 to 6 days.It may also be synthesized from Na 0 . 3 CoO 2 washed in water and subsequently exposed to water vapor in a 100% relative humidity chamber at room temperature.We have found the former method to be the more satisfactory of the two."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Figure 2 shows the change in weight for the three-layer superconducting Na 0.3 CoO 2 \u2022xH 2 O superhydrate on heating very slowly in flowing O 2 .  The behavior on heating is generally quite similar to that of the two- layer superconductor, but with significant differences. Water is lost in a series of steps on increasing temperature. The lowest temperature weight losses represent the evaporation of intergrain (surface) water, and the decomposition of the superhydrate to the intermediate hydrate. The plateau in weight from 35 to approximately 50 o C represents the stability region of the intermediate hydrate Na 0.3 CoO 2 \u20220.60H 2 O. This compound loses water in steps until decomposition to Na 0.5 CoO 2 and Co 3 O 4 at 300 o C. The inset to figure 2 compares the details of the weight loss characteristics of the two-layer and three-layer superconducting superhydrates at low temperatures. The lowest temperature weight losses are very similar, representing the evaporation of surface water. The hump at intermediate temperatures represents the water loss on decomposition of the superhydrate to the intermediate hydrate. From the weight loss observed, and the known formula of the intermediate hydrate, the formula for the superconducting superhydrate can be determined to be Na 0.30 CoO 2 \u20221.3H 2 O (in both cases). Looking carefully at the inset to figure 2 it is can be seen that that the three-layer superconducting superhydrate decomposes to the intermediate hydrate at 35 degrees, five degrees lower than the decomposition temperature of the two-layer superconductor, indicating that it is even less thermally stable than that phase, essentially barely stable at ambient temperature."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The data show that the material is a bulk superconductor, with superconducting characteristics similar to that of the double-layer cobaltate. In the three-layer system, however, we reproducibly observed a dependence of the superconducting properties on length of hydration time. Figure shows characteristic data illustrating this effect.  In this set of experiments, anhydrous sodium cobaltate of nominal composition Na 0.3 CoO 2 , obtained in a 40X reaction with bromine, was placed in a hydration chamber where the hydration process is accomplished at ambient temperature on exposure to an atmosphere of 100% relative humidity.A small portion of the sample was removed in daily intervals for testing. The figure shows that the initial T c is in the range of 3K. The T c then increases to the optimal value, where it is stable for several days.  Tc then degrades on further storage in the hydration atmosphere.  Powder X-ray diffraction characterization of the material indicated that the three-layer Na 0.30 CoO 2 \u20221.3H 2 O superconducting phase is present and single-phase to our experimental sensitivity for the duration of these experiments.Therefore the chemical changes that are taking place to yield the observations in figure do not involve decomposition of the superconducting phase but rather subtle structural or chemical changes.  One possibility is that some Na may be leached out of the superconductor into the surrounding intergrain water over a period of several days 6 , 7 an effect that is accelerated for hydration by immersion in large volumes of liquid water. The observed change in Tc may therefore represent the leaching of a slightly Na rich composition through the optimal composition to a Na poor composition over a period of a week, tracing out the narrow peak in Tc vs.Na content .The lower chemical stability of the three- layer superhydrate at ambient conditions may be what allows this effect to be observed on a short laboratory time scale, but the general similarity of the chemistry of the phases suggests that this is may occur to a smaller degree in the two-layer superconductor as well."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The difference in alignment of CoO 2 layers and oxygen coordination of the Na ions make the chemistry of the three- layer phase somewhat different from the two-layer phase, especially with respect to its stability in laboratory air at ambient temperature. This is likely due to differences in the H 2 O molecule arrangement necessary for bonding the two H 2 O layers to the oxygen in neighboring CoO 2 planes: neutron diffraction will be needed to shed light on the coordination of the water molecules and the Na ions in the three- layer superconductor. The identical superconducting critical temperatures observed in the two-layer and three-layer superconductors demonstrate that they are essentially electronically equivalent, and that electronic states that extend from one layer to the next do not appear to critically influence the superconductivity. The copper oxide superconductors do not include two compounds that differ only in the orientations or positions of neighboring layers while being identical in all other aspects of the chemistry and structure, such as formula and interlayer spacing, and so the effect of varying only the interlayer coupling can not be tested in the same manner as it can in the case of comparison of the properties of the two- layer and three-layer superconducting cobalt oxyhydrates.

BiS2-based compounds have a layered structure composed of an alternate stacking of superconducting and blocking layers, which is a common feature of cuprate or Fe-based superconductors. The typical BiS 2 -based compound LaOBiS 2 shows superconductivity by O substitution with F in the blocking layer, which supplies electron carriers into the BiS 2 superconducting layer.    This led to considerable advances in the BiS 2 -based superconducting family within a few years.Interestingly, many BiS 2 -based superconductors are sensitive to external pressure. The T c enhancement has been attributed to the local structure sensitivity of the BiS 2 -based superconducting materials.Recently, it has been reported that the BiS 2 -based compound EuFBiS 2 shows superconductivity even without any chemical doping.  A charge-density-wave (CDW)-like behavior was simultaneously observed in its electrical resistivity. It is necessary to have more information about its physical properties by using other probes.In this study, we demonstrate the electrical resistivity measurements of EuFBiS 2 under high pressure.It is found that the semiconducting sample shows insulator-metal transition and superconductivity is induced by only applying pressure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

From the comparison between 1/T 1 T and \u03c7 bulk or Knight shift, we can have an important information about spin- fluctuation character, since the latter are related with the static susceptibility at q = 0, \u03c7(0). If AFM corre- lations are dominant, which is the case in cuprate su- perconductors, dynamical susceptibility has peaks at the AFM wave vector Q apart from q = 0, therefore 1/T 1 T is mainly determined by staggered susceptibility, \u03c7(Q). In most cuprate superconductors, 1/T 1 T and \u03c7 bulk show different behavior, i.e., 1/T 1 T is enhanced whereas \u03c7 bulk decreases with deceasing temperature due to the develop- ment of AFM correlations. 13) Such information played a crucial role in identifying the existence of AFM spin fluc- tuations in underdoped cuprate superconductor.  On the contrary, when FM correlations are dominant, the dy- namical susceptibility shows a peak at q = 0, thus 1/T 1 T is dominant by \u03c7(0) component. In the SCR theory which describes the magnetic properties in weakly or nearly FM metallic state successfully, 1/T 1 T was suggested to be proportional to \u03c7(0).

The inset shows the plot of 1/T 1 T against \u03c7 bulk . shows temperature dependence of 1/T 1 T in the normal state up to 200 K, together with bulk suscep- tibility \u03c7 bulk for comparison. It was found that 1/T 1 T shows a good linear relation with \u03c7 bulk , as seen in the inset of . The good linear scaling between 1/T 1 T and \u03c7 bulk strongly suggests that upturn of \u03c7 bulk in the SC sample below 100 K is intrinsic behavior in the com- pound, not from impurity phases. The linear relation in the inset of also suggests that the spin fluctuations seen in the SC sample is nearly ferromagnetic ones, and that superconductivity would appear in the nearly FM metallic state, which is a quite contrast situation where cuprate superconductivity appears. The nearly FM state is also suggested by the large Wilson ratio (3.33), where the values of \u03c7 bulk and \u03b3 of specific-heat measurement just above T c 18) are adopted for the estimation.  Until now, it was found that most unconventional su- perconductors appearing in the paramagnetic state have strong AFM spin fluctuations. Even in spin-triplet super- conductors reported so far, i.e., UPt and Sr 2 RuO 4 , dominant spin fluctuations are not FM but AFM like.  Re- cently unconventional superconductivity was discovered far below FM transition, which is considered as spin- triplet superconductors in the FM state. However, although the existence of FM fluctuations above T c has not been identified in the FM superconductors due to dif- ficulty of experiments, it is likely that FM fluctuations are mostly quenched deep into the FM ordered phase.There has been no report about superconductivity ap- pearing in the predominance of FM fluctuations.  Thus, as far as we know, Na x CoO 2 \u00b7yH 2 O reported here is the first example that the superconductivity appears in the nearly FM metallic state. In such a situation, spin-triplet super- conductivity in analogy with superfluidity of 3 He would be the most promising state within possible SC pairing states. To identify the spin state of SC pairs, Knight- shift measurement in the SC state is most crucial. Quite recently, Waki et al. reported that the Co-NMR spec- trum in the aligned SC sample is unchanged on passing through T c, 2) whereas Kobayashi et al. reported the de- crease of the Knight shift in the non-aligned SC sam- ple. The Knight shift behavior in the SC state is now controversial issue.The result of the former group sug- gests a spin-triplet superconducting state which is con- sistent with our NQR results."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

A fundamental question is whether lattice effects are relevant for the occurrence of high-temperature superconductivity. In order to clarify this point a large number of isotope-effect studies were performed since 1987 . The first oxygen-isotope effect (OIE) studies on the transition temperature T c were performed on optimally doped samples, showing no significant isotope shift .  However, later experiments revealed a small but finite dependence of T c on the oxygen-isotope mass M O , as well as on the copper-isotope mass M Cu .

However, in all these experiments the penetration depth was determined indirectly from the onset of magne- tization , from the Meissner fraction , and from magnetic torque measurements . The muon- spin rotation (\u00b5SR ) technique is a direct and accurate method to determine the penetration depth \u03bb in type II superconductors.  In this Letter, we report \u00b5SR measure- ments of in-plane penetration depth \u03bb ab in underdoped Y 1\u2212x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 (x = 0.3 and 0.4) with two differ- ent oxygen isotopes ( 16 O and 18 O).A large OIE on \u03bb ab was observed which mainly arises from the oxygen-mass dependence of m * ab .  Polycrystalline samples of Y 1\u2212x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 (x = 0.3 and x = 0.4) were prepared by standard solid state reaction . Oxygen isotope exchange was performed during heating the samples in 18 O 2 gas. In order to en- sure the same thermal history of the substituted ( 18 O) and not substituted ( 16 O) sample, two experiments (in 16 O 2 and 18 O 2 ) were always performed simultaneously. The exchange and back exchange processes were car- ried out at 600 o C during 25 h, and then the samples were slowly cooled (20 o C/h) in order to oxidize them completely. The 18 O content in the samples, as deter- mined from a change of the sample weight after the iso- tope exchange, was found to be 78(2)% for both sam- ples. The total oxygen content of the samples was deter-mined using high-accuracy volumetric analysis . To examine the quality of the samples low-field (1mT, field- cooled) SQUID magnetization measurements were per- formed (see ). For both concentrations the T c onset for the 16 O samples was higher than for 18 O with nearly the same transition width. An oxygen back exchange of the 18 O sample (x = 0.4) resulted within error in almost the same magnetization curve as for the O sample, confirming that the back exchange is almost complete.

It is very unlikely that n s changes significantly upon O substitution, and after the back-exchange ( 18 O\u2192 16 O) the same results are obtained (see Figs. 1, 3 and ). (ii) According to a model that describes the suppression of T c in Y 1\u2212x Pr x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 , the num- ber of supercarriers decreases linearly with increasing x in the range of 0.05 < x < 0.5, and consequently \u2206n s /n s = \u2212\u2206x/x.   Moreover, for 0.1 < x < 0.5 the transition temperature T c decreases linearly with x, with \u2206T c /\u2206x \u2243 \u2212150 K/Pr atom .Combining this two relations one obtains: \u2206T c \u2243 \u2212150 \u00b7 x \u00b7 \u2206n s /n s .  As- suming that the observed OIE on \u03bb \u22122 ab is only due to a change of n s (\u2206m * ab /m * ab \u2243 0), one can estimate the cor- responding shift of T c . For x = 0.3 and x = 0.4 one finds \u2206T c \u2243 \u22121.8(4) K and \u22124.2(6) K, respectively. The ex- perimental values, however, are much lower (see ): \u2206T c = \u22121.3(1) K (x = 0.3) and \u2206T c = \u22121.7(1) K (x = 0.4). We thus conclude that any change in n s dur- ing the exchange procedure must be small, and that the change of \u03bb ab is mainly due to the OIE on the in-plane effective mass m * ab with \u2206m * ab /m * ab \u2243 5(2) % and 9(2) % for x = 0.3 and x = 0.4, respectively.This implies that the effective supercarrier mass m * ab in this cuprate su- perconductor depends on the oxygen mass of the lattice atoms, which is not expected for a conventional phonon- mediated BSC superconductor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Further- more, an empirical relation between the OIE exponents \u03b2 O and \u03b1 O was found that appears to be generic for vari- ous classes of cuprate superconductors.The OIE on m * ab implies that the superconducting carriers have polaronic character, and that lattice effects play an essential role in the occurrence of high-temperature superconductivity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

While in the BCS weak coupling theory, the penetration depth \u03bb(T ) varies as exp(\u2212\u2206/k B T ), a quadratic behavior \u03bb(T ) \u223c T 2 was reported by many groups in YBCO thin films .  Recently, in very high quality YBCO single crystals, a linear temperature dependence was measured up to 40 K . Such a variation, never observed so far in YBCO thin films , is consistent with the occurrence of nodes in the gap and may suggest a d-wave pairing mechanism . However other possible interpretations have been raised, both theoretically and experimentally, e.g. a possible proximity effect with a normal metal layer , or the sensitivity of a conventional BCS type \u03bb(T ) to the oxygenation of the samples .  Several reasons for the discrepancy observed between thin films and single crystals may be invoked: (i) within the framework of d-wave pairing, scattering due to im- purities or defects may change the linear temperature dependence into a quadratic one in thin films , where such defects would be more numerous.However T c should then also be affected, which is not the case . (ii) weak links, more likely to be present in thin films, may yield an effective penetration depth (larger than the intrinsic one) with a different temperature dependence .  The penetration depth \u03bb has been essentially measured in both single crystals and thin films by using surface impedance techniques at a single frequency . Such measurements actually measure the variation \u2206\u03bb(T ) = \u03bb(T ) \u2212 \u03bb(0), but without the knowledge of \u03bb(0) on each sample, comparing the temperature dependence of various samples may not be significant. This paper reports for the first time, from high frequency transmission data, both an unambiguous linear temperature dependence of \u03bb(T ) on high quality YBCO thin films, which is quantitatively the same as in single crystals , and simultaneously \u03bb(0) \u223c 1750\u00c5. We observe a quadratic temperature dependence on a lower quality sample, and \u03bb(0) \u223c 3600\u00c5. We suggest that this T 2 dependence in thin films is not a consequence of strong scattering (in contrast with Zn or Ni doped materials ) but is of extrinsic origin.The intrinsic dependence of \u03bb(T ) at low temperature is linear."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The two others (B1 and B2) display either a low surface resistance or a narrow rocking curve.  We show in and the normalized transmission of the A1 and B2 films respectively. Strong differences are observed, in particular for the residual transmission in the superconducting state.  At T \u2264 0.5 T c , the transmission increases as \u03c9 2 in sample B2, as expected from and as shown in the inset of . In sample A1, the data can be analyzed by adding a constant T 0 to the \u03c9 2 term .We estimate T 0 from the 10 K data (see inset of .   We compute \u03bb(T ) from (2) for the three frequencies, assuming that T 0 in the case of A1, does not depend on temperature or frequency. The result of this analysis is shown on and for the samples A1 and B2.The 120, 330 and 510 GHz curves collapse, up to 40 K 5 for sample A1 and up to 55 K for sample B2. This confirms that the frequency dependent part of the transmission varies as \u03c9 2 , and that \u03c3 2 (\u03c9, T ) \u226b \u03c3 1 (\u03c9, T ) in these temperature ranges. \u03bb(0) is found to be 1750 \u00b1 160\u00c5 for B2 and 3600 \u00b1 200\u00c5 for A1.  The uncertainty on \u03bb(0) depends mostly on the accuracy on the \u03c3 110 measurement, which is limited by the uncertainty on the film thickness (\u00b1100\u00c5) and by the Van der Pauw technique.  Finally the most striking result is the temperature dependence of \u03bb(T ).For sample A1, we find as shown in the inset, a clear T 2 dependence, a fairly common result for thin films , associated with a very large value for \u03bb(0).In contrast, for sample B2, we find a linear temperature dependence up to 50 K along with a much shorter \u03bb(0).Such a linear behavior was similarly observed in film B1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We believe that they demonstrate clearly the extrinsic origin of the T 2 dependence found previously in thin films. Indeed they agree with a phenomenological expression \u03bb 2 (T ) = \u03bb 2 intr (T )+\u03bb 2 extr (T ) as proposed by Hylton et al., with \u03bb extr being for example the contribution of weak links (but our conclusions are obviously independent of this specific expression). When \u03bb extr is the dominating contribu- tion as in our film A1 it may produce the T 2 dependence which is likely to change from sample to sample. Indeed, the data of Porch et al. (see inset of Fig. 3) are not the same as ours. On the other hand, for good enough films, \u03bb extr gets negligible and we find the intrinsic behavior for \u03bb(T ) which is linear, and is expected to be unchanged from films to crystals. The YBCO single crystals results of Hardy et al. are reported on Fig. 4, shifted to our \u03bb(0) value.  The excellent agreement between the two sets of data confirms the intrinsic nature of \u03bb in film B2. We remark that the agreement between \u03bb(T ) in two completely unrelated samples is a very strong result since, except for a coincidence, it eliminates any extrinsic explanation like poor surface effects or pair breaking due to magnetic impurities , for the interpretations of the linear dependence. However the nature of the low energy excitations is still unknown and it is also not yet clear whether they are linked to the planes or to the chains. Furthermore, the T 2 dependence appears in a film where the penetration depth is large. Our \u03bb intr (0) is much shorter. It is larger though than \u03bb ab (0) = 1450-1490\u00c5 derive by \u00b5SR , and consistent with \u03bb a (0) = 1600\u00c5 provided by infrared reflectance data .

These studies may also help to improve the theories of the 2 quasiparticles in cuprates. Furthermore, since a small impurity scattering rate can cause disappearance of the T 2 term, it is desirable to know the magnetic field dependence of C(T,H) in the impurity-doped cuprates.   Comparisons between C(T,H) of the nominally clean samples and that of the impurity-doped ones may generate fruitful implication on the existing puzzles.T o s e rv e t h e s e pu rpos e s , La 1.78 Sr 0.22 Cu 1-x Ni x O 4 samples were chosen for two main reasons. C of the Ni-doped samples has a much smaller magnetic contribution than that of the Zn-doped samples, and the data analysis can be simplified. Moreover, La 1.78 Sr 0.22 CuO 4 has been compellingly shown to be a clean d-wave superconductor [5], and is ideal to compare with the Ni-doped samples.   Polycrystalline samples of La 1.78 Sr 0.22 Cu 1-x Ni x O 4 with nominal x=0, 0.01, and 0.02 were carefully prepared from La 2 O 3 , SrCO 3 , and CuO powder of 99.999% purity. Details of the preparation were described elsewhere [5].The powder x-ray-diffraction patterns of all samples used in the experiments show a single T phase with no detection of impurity phases.The transition temperature T c by the midpoint of the resistivity drop is 28.7, 21.2 and 17.4 K for x=0, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively.The transition width (90% to 10% by the resistivity drop) of T c is 3 K or less for all samples, suggesting a decent homogeneity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Phenomenologically, inclusion of nC S=2 also yields a better fit than that of the Schottky anomaly. C(T,0) of samples with x=0, 0.01 and 0.02 is shown in Fig. 1.  For x=0, at zero field C/T vs. T 2 shows an obvious downward curve at low temperatures due to the T 2 term in C. For x=0.01, this downward curve becomes a straight line except below 1 K where the contribution from the magnetic contribution becomes important.  An increase in g with increasing x can also be recognized directly from data shown in Fig. 1. Both disappearance of the T 2 term and the increase in g are considered as manifestations of the impurity scattering.The low-temperature upturn in C/T of both x=0.01 and 0.02 can be attributed to nC S=2 by the solid lines resulted from the fit by Eq. (1).  To further show the quality of the fit in H, C(T,H) of x=0.01 at low temperatures is shown in Fig. 2(a) as an example, together with the solid lines representing the fit of data to Eq. (1). The results illustrate that C(T,H) of L a 1.78 Sr 0.22 Cu 1-x Ni x O 4 can be satisfactorily described by Eq. (1).  The contribution of nC S=2 compared with other terms is shown in Fig. 3. As expected, n resulting from the fit does not change significantly with H, however with variation in H\u00b34 T as shown in Fig. 2(b).  Similar results of n vs. H can be found in all three samples.It is likely that the effective Hamiltonian for C S=2 in Ref. results from the experimental data with H<4 T , and is most suited for low magnetic fields.From the low-field fitting results, n of x=0, 0.01, and 0.02 is about 0.3, 0.9, and 1.8\u00b410 -4 respectively.The value of n for x=0 is taken from the fit of the data in H and implemented into the fit at H=0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The substrate temperature dependence of orientation and superconducting poperties were systematically studied. Good quality c and a-axis orientated films can be obtained on SrTiO 3 via changing the substrate temperature solely. On YSZ, films with good c-axis orientation can be grown, while it is hard to grow films with good a-axis orientation by changing substrate temperature alone. The highest T C0 is about 37K, which is found in the films grown on YSZ with a good c-axis orientation.  For the films grown on STO, however, the highest T C0 is about 35.6K with a mixed orientation of c-axis and a-axis. In most of the superconducting films, the weak temperature dependence of the normal state resistivity, as characterized by small R(290K)/R(50K) \u2264 2 ratios, together with a weak localization behavior just above T C could be attributed to the essential scattering due to the localized electronic states.

Although PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 (Pr-123 ) can be formed, it does not show superconductivity at low temperature and even shows no metallic behavior. There are also reports on superconductivity in Pr-123 , however, the bulk superconductivity of Pr-123, has to be independently verified and also the structure of superconducting Pr-123 has to be confirmed by rigorous crystallography. Optical study has shown that PrBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 is a charge transfer type insulator with a charge- transfer gap \u2206 CT \u223c1.4 eV, and carriers in the chain are localized at low temperatures and low frequencies .   Due to the depletion of mobile carriers, the in-plane electric transport properties in Pr-123 could be described in terms of variable range hopping (VRH) in the insulating region .When the high-temperature cuprates are doped with P r the superconductivity is usually suppressed , and often a metal-insulator transition occurs, accompanied by the presence of complicated magnetic behavior due to the relatively large magnetic moment of Pr ions .The origin of the suppression of superconductivity in HTSC by Pr and absence of superconductivity in Pr-123, being of fundamental interest, may also shed light on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, since any reasonable theory should explain the effect of Pr on superconductivity in 123 systems."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

A substitution of divalent element such as Ca for Pr appears to be a natural choice. Nevertheless no superconductivity was found in the samples with fairly low Ca doping levels (less than 30% at ambient pressure). Norton et al. successfully revived superconductivity in Pr-123 epitaxial thin films by substituting 50% of the tetravalent Pr by divalent Ca .  And later, superconductivity was again found in high-pressure synthesized Ca-doped Pr-123 bulk samples . However, the influence of crystal structures on superconductivity in the thin films is still somewhat ambiguous. For example, it is necessary to study the superconductivity in films with different orientations systematically. And also it is important to make a comparative study of the transport properties of thin films and that of ceramic bulk samples. The transport properties of Ca-doped Pr-123 bulk samples sintered at ambient pressure have been studied by Luszczek .  However, researches are harassed by the limited Ca substitution levels and no superconductivity was observed.Whereas, for the samples synthesized at high pressures, impurity phases seems hard to be avoided, although the Ca content is highly improved .

The stoichiometric quantities of high-purity dry Pr 6 O 11 , CaCO 3 , BaCO 3 , and CuO powders were ground, mixed, fired, pelletized and sintered for several times. The sintering temperature was 930 \u2022 C. The whole process was carried out in air under an ambient pressure. Powder X-ray diffraction indicated a predominant R-123 phase while a small amount of BaCuO 2 could also be detected.  The Pr 0.5 Ca 0.5 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 epitaxial thin films were grown using pulsed-laser ablation mainly on the substrates of SrTiO 3 (STO) and Yttrium-stabilized ZrO 2 (YSZ).Some LaAlO 3 (LAO) and (LaAlO 3 ) 0.3 -(Sr 2 AlTaO 8 ) 0.7 (LSAT) substrates were also used.  A silicon heater was utilized in the film deposition, and the temperature was monitored by an infrared thermodetector with a calibrated temperature range from 300 \u2022 C to 1200 \u2022 C. A self-made NiCr-NiAl thermocouple was placed at the back of the heater as a temperature reference. A LPX 300 KrF (\u03bb =248 nm) excimer laser (Lambda Phyisk) was adopted for the film growth. The repetition rate was 5 Hz and the fluence was about 2 J/cm 2 . The target- substrate distance was kept at 70 mm. The films were deposited in an oxygen partial pressure of 40 Pa, as frequently seen in the growth of YBCO. After deposition, a one- minute holding before annealing was used for the purpose of stress relaxation. The annealing process was carried out in 1 atm oxygen at a cooling rate around 15 o C/min for about 10 minutes (The superconductivity of the film was found hardly dependent on the annealing duration at this circumstance). The films were then cooled down naturally to room temperature.The superconducting critical temperature of the films was measured using a standard four-probe technique, with the electrodes mounted by silver paste on the films directly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Before the superconducting transition, resistivity of these films raises slightly, suggesting a weak carrier localization.  The small resistivity slope and the localization-like behavior near the superconducting transition temperature, which are often observed in 50% Pr doped YBCO, are almost independent of the magnetic field strength, as being noticed from the resistivity data at B \u2264 10 T. The weak localization behavior could be attributed mainly to the low carrier density, as having been well shown in the underdoped YBCO and La 1\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 systems.    In fact, Hall measurements carried out in 50% Ca-doped samples shows an in-plane carrier density lower than that in the optimum-doped YBCO .The weak temperature dependence of normal resistivity indicates an important scattering to the electron from the localized states in the present system.The disorder of Ba and Pr elements could contribute to such localized states, which is possible in the present film grown in an oxygen partial pressure of 40 Pa.The Pr ions may substitute for Ba in the lattice, similar to the Nd and Ba disorder observed in Nd 1+x Ba 2\u2212x Cu 3 O 7 films grown at oxygen partial pressures higher than 1 bar ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.
