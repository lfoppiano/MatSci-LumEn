No other phases were detected by powder x-ray diffraction and the phase purity is thought to be bet- ter than 1%. Lattice parameters were in good agreement with published work . High field magnetic susceptibil- ity measurements showed no signatures of excess param- agnetic centres.  The measured T c 's are 30, 37.7, 36, 27.5 and 20.3 K for x = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.22 and 0.24, re- spectively.      These values are also in very good agreement with previous measurements . \u00b5SR experiments as a function of T were performed on the same powders for x = 0.10 and 0.15. Although unoriented powders can be used to determine \u03bb ab by \u00b5SR , the acs technique re- quires the powders to be magnetically aligned .To eliminate grain agglomerates, powders were ball-milled in ethanol and dried after adding a defloculant. Scan- ning electron microscopy confirmed the absence of grain boundaries and showed that the average grain diameter was \u223c 5\u00b5m.The powders were mixed with a 5 min curing epoxy and aligned in a static field of 12T at room tem- perature. Debye-Scherrer x-ray scans showed that \u223c 90% of the grains were aligned within \u223c 2.0 o .Low-field sus- ceptibility measurements were performed at an ac-field H ac = 1 G rms (parallel to the c-axis) and a frequency f = 333 Hz down to 1.2K.  Details of the application of London's model for deriving \u03bb from the measured sus- ceptibility can be found in an earlier publication .  Transverse-field-cooled \u00b5SR experiments were performed at 400 Gauss in the ISIS, Rutherford-Appleton Labora- tory. The field produced a flux-line lattice whose field distribution was probed by muons. The depolarisation rate, \u03c3(T ), of the initial muon spin is proportional to \u03bb ab \u22122 (T ) . Checks were made to ensure that the values of \u03bb ab obtained were independent of the applied field. The Hg-1201 [\u03b4 = 0.10 (T c = 60K) and 0.37 (T c = 35K)] samples were prepared in Houston by the con- trolled solid-vapour reaction technique . The values of \u03bb ab (0) derived from the acs data for LSCO are 0.28, 0.26, 0.197, 0.193, 0.194 \u00b5m for x = p = 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.22 and 0.24, respectively.Here p is the hole content per planar copper atom. The esti- mated error for \u03bb ab (0) obtained by the acs technique is \u00b115% and within this uncertainty the \u03bb ab (0) values agree with the \u00b5SR measurements.We thus find that \u03bb \u22122 ab (0) is strongly suppressed on the underdoped side, including optimal doping, but there is no suppression with increas- ing overdoping (up to p = 0.24) in contrast to reports for Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+\u03b4.Values of \u03bb ab (0) as obtained by \u00b5SR for Hg-1201 are 0.194 and 0.148 \u00b5m for \u03b4 = 0.10 and 0.37, respectively.We note that \u03b4 = 0.10 and 0.37 in Hg-1201 correspond to p = 0.075 and 0.22, respectively ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In the inset we observe a good correlation between [1/\u03bb ab (0)] 2 and [S/T(T c ) -S/T(2K)] both plotted versus Sr con- tent x, where S(T) is the electronic entropy obtained by integrating the electronic specific heat coefficient \u03b3(T) from 0 to T. The quantity [S/T(T c ) -S/T(2K)] is a measure of the energy-dependent NS electronic density of states (DOS), g n (E), averaged over \u00b12k B T c around the Fermi energy E F .  The effect of an energy -dependent DOS on the London penetration depth \u03bb L or \u03c1 s (0) is not usually considered in standard theory which implic- itly assumes a constant DOS and a parabolic E( k) dis- persion relation.It has been argued elsewhere that \u03c1 s (0) = 4\u03c0 2 v x 2 g n (E) /e 2 where the average is over an (anisotropic) energy shell E F \u00b1 \u2206 0 . Note that this result agrees with the standard expression for the NS conduc- tivity and the usual relation between \u03bb L (0) and the real part of the frequency-dependent electronic conductivity in the normal and superconducting states \u03c3 1 n (\u03c9) and \u03c3 s 1 (\u03c9), respectively. Namely, \u03bb L (0) is determined by the area under the [\u03c3 1 n (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c3 1 s (\u03c9)] curve in the frequency range 0 < h\u03c9/2\u03c0 < 2\u2206 0 . Thus the inset to Fig. sug- gests that the strong decrease of \u03c1 s (0) with x from x = 0.20 to 0.10 is related to the suppression of spectral weight with energy range E F \u00b1 \u2206 0 due to the presence of \u2206 N ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

There appears to be a systematic deviation of the data from the weak- coupling T-dependence with a greater (weaker) curvature on the underdoped (overdoped) side. We note however, that particularly in the overdoped samples there is pos- itive curvature near T c which may arise from a small amount of doping inhomogeneity giving a distribution of T c values in this region where dT c /dp is maximal .  The effect of this is to rescale the curves with a slightly lower value of T c . We have modelled \u03c1 s (T ) using the d-wave T-dependence and a normal distribution of T c values with standard deviation of 3%, 5% and 9% for x = 0.20, 0.22 and 0.24, respectively.

However, the x = 0.24 sample still shows significant deviations that possibly reflect changes in the electronic structure. This would not be surprising given the changes in the FS with the rapid crossover from hole-like to electron-like states near x = 0.27 .We note that the data for x = 0.24 is in excellent agreement with a weak-coupling d-wave calculation for a rectangular FS ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

First, single- phase hexagonal Na 0.74 CoO 2 was prepared by a solid- state reaction at 1083 K in flowing oxygen with Na 2 CO 3 and Co 3 O 4 as the starting material. Second, partial sodium in Na 0.74 CoO 2 was deintercalated by the exces- sive bromine solved in acetonitrile, similar to the treat- ment reported previously . Third, a hydration pro- cess was carried out by the direct reaction with distilled water. Last, the sample was slightly dehydrated and then \"annealed\" under ambient condition.

By employing the Atomic absorption spectroscopy, the atomic ratio of Na and Co was determined as 0.31 for the final product. Thermo- gravimetric analysis shows that the weight loss from 293 K to 693 K is 19.8 %, indicating that the content of H 2 O is about 1.3 per formula.

It is proposed that the relatively low superconducting fraction is mainly due to the sample's intrinsic 2D characteristic. The following observations are coincident with this point. First, the superconduct- ing transition is broad. Second, zero resistance can never be achieved in our experiments as well as the previous re- port . Third, the diamagnetic signal is enhanced when decreasing H ac . Similar result was reported for a 2D or- ganic superconductor (BEDT-TTF) 2 Cu(NCS) 2 .

The H c2 value is difficult to be measured by the M \u2212 H curve due to the very narrow hysteresis. Nevertheless, by measuring the electrical resistance at fixed temper- atures, one can basically obtain the H c2 (T ) data, as shown in figure 2(b). H c2 (T ) is here determined as the point where the resistance deviates from the linearity in the R \u2212 H 2 curves .  The slope of H c2 at T c , dH c2 /dT | Tc , is obtained as \u221234 kOe/K.H c2 (0) can thus be estimated to be 1\u00d710 5 Oe, using the WHH for- mula .  Then, the average Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherent length \u03be GL (0)=57\u00c5 can be calculated using the formula \u03be GL (0)=(\u03a6 0 /2\u03c0H c2 (0) 1/2 . On the other hand, by solving the equation H c1 = \u03a6 0 ln(\u03bb/\u03be)/4\u03c0\u03bb 2 , the average penetration depths can also be obtained: \u03bb(0)=7900\u00c5 . Therefore, the Ginzburg-Landau param- eter \u03ba = \u03bb/\u03be GL is estimated as \u223c 140, indicating that the cobalt oxyhydrate is an extreme type-II supercon- ductor, like the high-T c cuprates. This conclusion has also been drawn in a very recent report , in which dif- ferent method was employed to determine the H c2 (T ).  It is worth while to note that, compared with the previ- ous result, the values of H c1 (0) and H c2 (0) in the present sample are remarkably smaller, which is possibly resulted from the differences in the carrier-doping level and/or the water content.The result of low-temperature specific heat measure- ment is shown in figure .At temperatures much below the Debye temperature \u0398 D , and if neglected the possi- ble magnetic contribution, the specific heat can be ex- pressed as the sum of electron and phonon contributions: C = \u03b3T + \u03b2T 3 , where the coefficient \u03b3 is generally called"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The phonon contribution can be separated by employing the T 2 vs C/T plot. It can be seen that good linearity is satisfied in the temperature range of 4.5 K< T <11 K. We thus obtained \u03b3 = 15.9 mJ/K 2 \u2022mol-f.u. (f.u. denotes formula unit) and \u03b2 = 0.235 mJ/K 4 \u2022 mol-f.u. \u0398 D is then calculated to be 391 K using the formula \u0398 D = (12/5)N \u03c0 4 R/\u03b2) 1/3 , where N =7.21 for Na 0.31 CoO 2 \u20221.3H 2 O and R=8.314 J/mol\u2022K. The \u03b3 value is significantly smaller than that of the par- ent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 (\u03b3 \u223c 40 mJ/K 2 \u2022mol-Co ). Since the Sommerfeld parameter \u03b3 is related to the den- sity of state (DOS) at Fermi level, N (E F ), by the relation where N (0) is the bare, or band-structure electronic DOS at E F , \u03bb ep an electron-phonon interaction parameter , one can ob- tain that N (E F )=6.7 states/eV\u2022f.u.  On the other hand, \u03bb ep can be calculated to be 0.57 using the formula where Coulomb repulsion parameter \u00b5 * is assumed to be 0.13 empirically .Therefore, N (0) is derived to be 4.3 states/eV\u2022f.u. We note that this value is almost identical to the band calculation result (4.4 states/eV\u2022Co) for the parent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 . It is noted that the sample's magnetic susceptibility (\u223c 2.0\u00d710 \u22123 emu/mol-f.u) is almost temperature indepen- dent from 30 K to 300 K (not shown here).  In order to obtain the Pauli susceptibility \u03c7 P auli , the \u03c7(T ) data were fitted using the equation \u03c7 = \u03c7 0 + AT 2 + C/(T \u2212 \u03b8) . We obtained that \u03c7 0 , A, C and \u03b8 are 0.0019 emu/mol, 2.6 \u00d710 \u22129 emu/mol\u2022K 2 , 0.0024 emu\u2022K/mol and 1.7 K, respectively. The parameter C gives the small effective magnetic moment of 0.14 \u00b5 B . The small positive \u03b8 value suggests the existence of weak ferromagnetic correlations. The unusually large \u03c7 0 value should be dominantly con- tributed by \u03c7 P auli , which is probably enhanced by the Stoner-type ferromagnetic correlation. The Wilson ra- tio, R W = \u03c0 2 k 2 B \u03c7 P auli /3\u03b3\u00b5 2 B , is calculated to be 11, in sharp contrast with the case of heavy fermion supercon- ductor .

These iron based superconductors contain superconducting [FePn(Se)] (where Pn is pnictide element of As or P) layers which are interlaced by charge carrier reservoir layers. Most of their parent compounds are in the form of antiferromagnetic spin density wave (SDW) states.  The antiferromagnetism can be suppressed by either introducing charge carrier or applying pressure, leading to superconductivity.Superconductivity can be induced by various methods of element substitution, either in the plane of [FePn(Se)] layer, or out of the plane. For instance, in the case of BaFe 2 As 2 , K-substitution at the Ba site, Co or Ni substitution at the Fe site, or P substitution at the As site, will induce superconductivity respectively . The partial replacement of Ba 2+ ion by K + ion will introduce hole- like charge carrier to the system, while chemical pressure is applied when As atoms are substituted partially by P atoms.  However, the effect of substitution at Fe site is quite different . It seems that both Co or Ni substitution at Fe site introduce itinerant electrons, as experimentally indicated by Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

It has been experimentally proven that the surface of LiFeAs preserves its bulk properties.  Therefore ARPES reflects the intrinsic properties for the LiFeAs crystals. Previously ARPES were used to study the Fermi surface evaluation when Fe is partially substituted by Co . The results show that Co substitution introduces electron type charge carriers and results in chemical potential shifting upwards, indicating electron doping. The Fermi surface (FS) mappings along the -M high symmetry line from ARPES for undoped and Cu 6% doped LiFeAs are shown in figures 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. To check how FSs change with Cu substitution, extracted k F locus were plotted in figures 5(a), 5(b) and 5(e), respectively.  Red circles and green triangles represent undoped and Cu 6% doped Li(Fe 1\u2212x Cu x )As, respectively.The results reveal no significant difference in these two different crystals, except for the small hole FS observed in LiFeAs, which disappeared in the Cu 6% doped Li(Fe 1\u2212x Cu x )As, indicating small electron doping effect.  Additionally, the normal state (T = 30 K) high resolution ARPES intensity plots along the -M high symmetry line are shown in figures 5(c) and 5(d), respectively.  The incident light was set to 51 eV (k z = 0) with its polarization perpendicular to the mirror plane to select odd symmetry orbitals. Red and green solid circles were used to extract the band dispersion, which generates the small hole FS in LiFeAs.It is clear that the extracted band crosses E F in LiFeAs but sinks below E F in Cu 6% sample. Our results show that, unlike Co and Ni substituted LiFeAs , where extra electrons cause Fermi level to shift, the FSs of Cu substituted LiFeAs remained almost intact.  Hence, the 3 d electrons from Cu dopant in LiFeAs are more localized and contribute little to the FSs. Berlijn et al studied disorder effects of Co and Zn substitution in Ba122 system .  They found that the calculated Femi surface behaviors of Zn substitution induced deep impurity level that is quite different from the effect of Co doping. Recently Ideta et al reported strong localization effects in Zn substituted BaFe 2 As 2, wherein all the extra electrons are localized at the state of \u223c10 eV below FSs and do not contribute to the chemical potential shift at all .Our results can be explained from the d-band partial density of states of Co, Ni and Cu in iron based superconductors.The behavior of Co or Ni substitution follows a rigid band model due to the fact that the d-bands of Co and Ni overlap with Fe d-band and are featureless compared with Fe d-band; whereas Cu presents deeper impurity potential of \u223c4 eV , which localizes most of the Cu 3 d orbital electrons.This is consistent with the lesser contraction of lattice parameters"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The anhydrous parent compound Na 0.61(1) CoO 2 has two partially occupied Na sites sandwiched, in the same plane, between CoO 2 layers. When Na is removed to make the superconducting composition, the Na site that experiences the strongest Na-Co repulsion is emptied while the occupancy of the other Na site is reduced to about one third.  The deuterate superconducting compound is formed by coordinating four D 2 O molecules (two above and two below) to each remaining Na ion in a way that gives Na-O distances nearly equal to those in the parent compound. One deuteron of the D 2 O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO 2 plane and the oxygen atom and the second deuteron of each D 2 O molecule lie approximately in a plane between the Na layer and the CoO 2 layers.This coordination of Na by four D 2 O molecules leads in a straightforward way to ordering of the Na ions and D 2 O molecules consistent with the observation of additional shorter-range scattering features in the diffraction data.

In recent years, the related anhydrous compound, Na x CoO 2 , has been studied because of its interesting transport properties.Wang et al. have argued that spin entropy arising from the two-dimensional triangular Co lattice is the explanation for the enhanced thermopower.  More recently, the same authors have reported an anomalous Hall effect for Na x CoO 2 . They observe that Na x CoO 2 exhibits \"strange metal physics as observed in the cuprates.\" Na x CoO 2 is made superconducting by removing part of the Na, which changes the oxidation state of Co, and intercalating water to dramatically increase the separation between the CoO 2 layers. Bulk superconductivity with T c >2 K has been reported to exist over a very narrow range of Na compositions, approximately 1/4\u2264x\u22641/3, in the hydrated compound Na x CoO 2 \u20221.3H 2 O with the maximum T c (4.5 K) at x\u22480.3.   This dome-like behavior of T c is reminiscent of the layered cuprates, suggesting that this new layered compound may be the first non-copper example of the same physics. The importance of the two- dimensional nature of the structure is emphasized by the fact that a lower hydrate, Na 0.3 CoO 2 \u20220.6H 2 O, with the same Co formal oxidation state but substantially less separation between the CoO 2 layers is not superconducting.  Prior to the recent interest in transport properties and superconductivity, compounds of this family were studied because of their fast-ion conducting properties.The Na ions are in two partially occupied crystallographic sites, both of which lie in a plane between layers of edge- sharing CoO 6 octahedra.The ability to change the Na (or other cation) content and to intercalate water has been investigated for isostructural compounds such as Na 2/3 (Co x Ni 1/3-x Mn 2/3 )O 2 ,and Li 0.12 K 0.35 MnO 2.14 \u20220.45H 2 O.However, the structural details of the water intercalation and, in particular, the crystal structure of the Na x CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O, have never been reported.Clearly, an understanding of the crystal structure is fundamental to interpreting the physical behavior."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We show that, when the Na concentration is reduced, Na is selectively removed from one of the two inequivalent Na sites. Then, after D 2 O is incorporated, the D 2 O molecules occupy sites between the CoO 2 layers and the Na ions in such a way that the coordination of Na to the oxygen ions of the D 2 O molecules is similar to its previous coordination to oxygen ions in the CoO 2 layers in Na 0.61 CoO 2, except that the Na to D 2 O ratio is four, resulting in two D 2 O molecules above the Na ion and two below.  One deuteron of each D 2 O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO 2 layer. The constraint of minimizing Na-D and D-D repulsions leads in a straightforward way to two-dimensional ordering of Na ions and D 2 O molecules.In the supercell structure, the second deuteron of each D 2 O molecule is hydrogen bonded to the oxygen atom of a neighboring D 2 O molecule to form hydrogen bonded zigzag D-O\u2022D-O\u2022D-O. chains.  The diffraction data are consistent with this ordering in the plane and also show that ordering along the c axis, with a shorter length scale, is present. A possible explanation is that both Na ions and D 2 O molecules are ordered in the plane, but D 2 O ordering has a much shorter coherence length than Na ordering along the c axis.

An initial powder stoichiometry of Na 0.7 CoO 2 resulted in a sample of composition Na 0.61(1) CoO 2 due to a slight loss of Na during the heating cycles.  (All compositions stated in the paper are those determined by Rietveld refinement using neutron powder diffraction data.)  The chemical oxidative deintercalation of Na from this material is generally done using Br 2 or I 2 in acetonitrile. For the neutron diffraction experiments, a fully deuterated sample was desired in order to avoid the large neutron incoherent scattering from hydrogen, which adds background to the diffraction data. In order to eliminate any possible hydrogen incorporation during the oxidative deintercalation, either from the acetonitrile or residual H 2 O in the acetonitrile, we used Br 2 in D 2 O as the oxidizing medium. About 10 wt% of Na 0.61 CoO 2 powder in D 2 O with a 100 to 200% excess of Br 2 was shaken overnight in an air-tight pyrex tube. The resulting powder was then separated by either filtration or centrifuging from the Br 2 solution with as little exposure to the atmosphere as possible.  After washing with D 2 O to remove excess Br 2 and NaBr the resulting material was kept in a container with 100% relative humidity of D 2 O.This \"as-oxidized\" deuterated material contained free D 2 O, as evidenced by the appearance of peaks from ice in a neutron powder diffraction pattern taken at low temperature. In order to remove only the free D 2 O and none of the lattice D 2 O, knowledge of the vapor pressure of D 2 O in equilibrium with the higher deuterate phase is required. Approximately 2g of the material was placed in a vacuum system and pumped to remove air. The D 2 O pressure over the hydrate was measured using a capacitance manometer as the D 2 O was volumetrically removed by cooling a calibrated glass bulb attached to the vacuum system to liquid nitrogen temperature. To allow the sample to come to equilibrium at each partial pressure of D 2 O, this cryopumping was done in small steps -typically a few minutes of pumping followed by equilibration times of up to several hours. All measurements were done at 23.0 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0 C. Fig . shows the D 2 O pressure as a function of removed D 2 O. The long plateau at 2.3-2.4 kPa pressure indicates that the sample is a mixture of free D 2 O and the higher deuterate phase (plus, perhaps, some D 2 O adsorbed on the walls of the vacuum system). In this particular experiment, ~1.6 cc of free D 2 O was removed before reaching the point where little additional free D 2 O remained and the D 2 O pressure dropped sharply with further pumping. The plateau at about 1 kPa indicates the transition to a two-phase deuterate mixture; i.e., a mixture of the higher deuterate phase and the lower deuterate phase reported to have the composition Na 0.3 CoO 2 \u20220.6D 2 O. A single phase of the higher deuterate with a minimum amount of free D 2 O can be made by equilibrating at a D 2 O pressure just above 1 kPa. The sample used for the diffraction measurements was equilibrated at 1.2 kPa D 2 O pressure overnight."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The structure is shown in Fig . . The CoO 2 layers are formed from edge-sharing CoO 6 octahedra, where the Co-O bond length is 1.908 \u00c5 (at room temperature). The oxygen atoms lie in two planes, above and below the plane of Co atoms. Na ions lie in two partially occupied sites in a plane halfway between the CoO 2 layers. The two Na sites differ in their coordination to the oxygen atoms in the CoO 2 layers, as shown in Fig . . The Na1 site is coordinated to six oxygen atoms that are bonded to six different Co atoms (three above and three below). The Na2 site is also coordinated to six oxygen atoms (three above and three below), but the sets of three oxygen atoms (above and below Na) are bonded to the same Co atoms. The average Na-O bond lengths are identical (by symmetry) for the two Na sites (2.379 \u00c5 at 12 K). It has previously been proposed [14] that slightly weaker bonding of the Na2 site results from Na-Co Coulomb repulsion, which is greater for this site when both first-and second-nearest neighbor Na-Co repulsions are considered. This leads to a smaller occupancy for the Na2 site compared to the Na1 site. The Na ions show displacements from their ideal sites at both room temperature and low temperature. This probably results from repulsion of randomly- located neighboring Na ions, locally violating the hexagonal symmetry. In Rietveld refinement, such displacements can be modeled with anisotropic temperature factors or by assigning the Na ions to displaced, partially occupied sites. The latter model has been used for the Na1 site in the refinements reported in Table . For the Na2 site, the displacement was not large enough to statistically justify a displaced-site model. Because this detail of the structural model does not give any additional insight into the compound, all figures show only the average, high-symmetry, Na sites and average Na-O bond lengths (i.e., bond lengths to the ideal, high-symmetry site). The tables, however, list the Na1-O bond lengths resulting from the use of a displaced-site model for Na1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

These refinements immediately showed that when Na is removed, it comes selectively from the more weakly bonded Na2 site, leaving that site empty within the accuracy of the refinement. In the final refinements, the occupancy of the Na2 site tended to go slightly negative (~ one esd) so it was set to zero. To achieve the x\u22480.3 composition, part of the Na is also removed from the Na1 site (which was initially only partially occupied).

These maps showed scattering density suggesting that the oxygen atoms of the D 2 O molecules were located in layers between the CoO 2 layers and Na layers. Additionally, the maps showed two possible deuterium sites: one approximately in the same plane as the oxygen atoms and one closer to the CoO 2 layers. Fourier maps from room-temperature and low-temperature data were not dramatically different. Rietveld refinements were then attempted by adding D 2 O molecules in general positions [24l(x,y,z)] with rigid-body constraints being used to maintain the expected molecule geometry; i.e., a D-O distance of 0.99\u00c5 and a D-O-D angle of 109\u00b0. This constraint is thought to be justified based on the configurations seen for water molecules in a wide range of hydrated compounds and ices. In this model, the refinement gives the best-fit position for the oxygen atom of the D 2 O molecule and the orientation of the molecule. The resulting refined structural parameters and selected bond lengths for the deuterate superconducting compound are given in Table . This refinement model gives a composition of Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 \u20221.25(2)D 2 O (based on the 12 K data where correlations between temperature factors and site occupancies are the smallest). The refined 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O (within one esd) suggests that the synthesis method used here, including the careful adjustment of the D 2 O content to the conditions for the most stable phase, has produced a compound with four D 2 O molecules coordinated to each Na ion. While sixfold coordination is common for Na ions, fourfold coordination is observed in many oxides and hydrated compounds, including Na 2 O.  The refined average Na-O distance (2.31 \u00c5) is also consistent with that expected for a four-coordinated Na hydrate and is remarkably similar to the Na-O distance for Na ions in water (2.4 \u00c5), where the average coordination is 4.9.(Note that when static displacement of the Na ions is considered, the resulting inequivalent Na-O distances vary from 2.18 to 2.42 \u00c5.)

A plausible picture for the actual structure can be readily constructed by considering logical rules for chemical bonding and coordination. All symmetry-equivalent D 2 O molecules have the same coordination to oxygen atoms in the CoO 2 plane. Hence, the actual structure can most easily be visualized by considering only one layer of D 2 O molecules and the associated Na ions. Fig . shows all symmetry-equivalent Na and D 2 O sites in one of these layers. If all such sites were occupied (including the D 2 O layers above and below Na), the composition would be NaCoO 2 \u202212D 2 O. However, it is straightforward to see that all of these sites cannot be simultaneously occupied. Three bonding/coordination rules can be applied to construct plausible structures from Fig . . First, to minimize D-Na repulsion, D 2 O molecules strongly prefer to be oriented with the deuteron \"pointing\" away from, not toward, an occupied Na site. Second, impossibly close oxygen-oxygen distances cannot occur. Third, each Na ion should be coordinated by four D 2 O molecules (two above and two below) in agreement with the refined composition and consistent with known Na oxide and hydrate compounds.  The application of these rules leads in a straightforward way to the ordered structure shown in Fig . . (The interested reader can sequentially mark Na and D 2 O sites in Fig . following the three rules above and see how this solution is obtained.)  Both the Na ions and the D 2 O molecules are ordered into a two-dimensional supercell.

This ordered structure has the ideal composition Na x CoO 2 \u20224xD 2 O with x=1/3 when all Na and D 2 O sites are occupied. The refined composition, Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 \u20221.25(2)D 2 O, suggests that the maximum T c is achieved at a composition slightly off the ideal composition, in agreement with other reports for the composition at maximum T c .   In the sample studied here, which was made in a way that places the composition at a plateau in partial pressure of D 2 O in equilibrium with the sample, the ideal 1:4 Na to D 2 O ratio is maintained, even though the sample is slightly deficient in both Na and D 2 O compared to the ideal model. Other reports indicate that a higher water content can be achieved for an Na content of x\u22480.3.It is perhaps possible that additional water could be accommodated using the space made available by Na vacancies for the x\u22480.3 composition (see Fig . ) . One can visualize a hydrogen-bonded network of D 2 O molecules occupying the available space in a way consistent with the pattern of symmetry equivalent positions shown in Fig . .  Alternatively, additional D 2 O could perhaps be accommodated in the Na plane, as in the structure of the lower deuterate phase, Na 0.3 CoO 2 \u20220.6D 2 O.  Thus, reports of water contents higher than 4/3 are not necessarily inconsistent with the model presented here, especially in the case where the Na content is below 1/3. However, the incorporation of two water molecules per formula unit, as reported by Jin et al. seems unlikely in light of the structure.Perhaps reports of water concentrations higher than 4/3 should be viewed with suspicion until it is shown that all of the water is actually in the lattice.  Surface adsorbed water could easily cause errors in bulk measurements of water content.The data presented here for the partial pressure of D 2 O in equilibrium with the hydrated material (Fig . ) argue that the water content does not depart far from the ideal 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O molecules.  Even if extra water can be accommodated in the space made available by Na vacancies, as the ideal Na content of 1/3 is approached the ability to accommodate extra water would be expected to decrease, Additionally, for Na contents greater than 1/3, the compound must either generate \"Na interstitial\" defects in the Na ordering, where the extra Na ions could not achieve the fourfold coordination to D 2 O molecules, or phase separate.The data of Schaak et al. for T c vs.Na concentration are consistent with phase separation for Na contents above x=1/3.T c remains constant at ~2 K, while the superconducting fraction decreases, for increasing Na contents above 1/3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Baskaran has presented a theory based on the idea that the highest T c in this system occurs between the compositions Na 1/3 and Na 1/4 that would be expected to give ordered phases.   One hypothesis of his theory is that ordering of Na ions would promote charge ordering of the Co atoms, which, in turn, would suppress superconductivity.Thus, the ordered phases at the ideal compositions x=1/3 and 1/4 would be unfavorable for superconductivity.  In agreement with these ideas, the maximum T c is achieved at a Na concentration below x=1/3.  However, the present results show that the optimal superconducting composition displays ordering, over an in-plane coherence length of ~1000 \u00c5, the same as for the ideal x=1/3 composition.  The increase of T c upon decreasing the Na content from x=1/3 could simply be a doping effect, as proposed by Schaak et al.To better understand this behavior, it is important to understand what happens when the Na concentration is further reduced toward the composition x=1/4, which corresponds to a different ordered structure in Baskaran's model.  Fig . shows a possible ordered structure with this Na concentration. At this Na concentration, each Na ion can achieve sixfold coordination to D 2 O molecules.  This is also the most common coordination for Na oxide and hydrate structures. The present data give no evidence for the occurrence of this ordered compound.However, if it does form at the Na composition x=1/4, the data of Schaak et al. for T c vs. composition may have a different interpretation.The drop in T c from 4.5 K to 2 K upon decreasing the Na concentration from 0.30 to 0.26 may result from a transition from the Na 1/3 to the Na 1/4 phase.If this is the case, the conclusion that the dome-like behavior of T c mimics the behavior seen in the layered cuprates [5] may be premature.Clearly, a careful structural study of a composition near x=1/4 must be pursued."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The deuteration of Na leads to the formation of 2D 2 O-Na-2D 2 O \"pillars\" extending between the CoO 2 planes. This interesting \"pillar\" structure is further stabilized by hydrogen bonding within the planes of the D 2 O molecules to form zigzag D-O\u2022D-O\u2022D-O. chains. These structural results are in contrast to initial reports that implied that the material could be viewed a solid solution that could intercalate both Na and D 2 O in varying amounts. The ideal composition of the superconducting phase is Na x CoO 2 \u20224xD 2 O (x\u22481/3).  The sample studied here has a refined Na composition of x=0.31(3) and a perfect 1:4 Na to D 2 O ratio (within one esd) consistent with the ideal structure, but with vacancy defects on both the Na and D 2 O sites; i.e., entire 2D 2 O-Na-2D 2 O \"pillar\" sites are vacant. . This hydrated phase would be expected to exist only within rather narrow composition limits.For x\u22651/3, fourfold coordination of Na by D 2 O molecules cannot be achieved.  As x approaches 1/4, a different ordered phase, involving sixfold coordination of the Na, could be formed.Thus, measurements of physical properties, such as T c, vs. composition should be viewed with caution until it is confirmed that all samples in a particular study are in the same phase."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In the \u03b2-pyrochlore RbOs 2 O 6 , A is the monovalent cation Rb, and B is the transition metal cation Os octahe- drally coordinated by O. It is derived from the parent compound by replacing the O \u2032 atoms by Rb atoms and leaving the 16d site empty (AB 2 O 6 \u2261 2 B 2 O 6 A \u2032 , where represents a vacancy). The Os atoms are coordinated by 6 O atoms and these OsO 6 octahedra share corners. They have edge-lengths of 2.67 and 2.72\u00c5 respectively, and the Os -O bonding distance is 1.91\u00c5. The electron donating Rb atoms are coordinated by O with a Rb -O distance of 3.13\u00c5. From X-ray measurements, we refine the 48f oxygen x parameter to 0.315(1). This results in O -Os -O angles in the octahedra of 88.85 \u2022 and 91.15 \u2022 . The B site may accommodate an ion carrying a localized magnetic moment, which in- teracts antiferromagnetically with its nearest neighbors. Since the B sublattice consists of interconnected tetrahedra, we have to account for the 3-dimensional geometrical frustration of the magnetic interactions, possibly leading to an unconventional groundstate. The inset of Fig. 1 shows an Os atom and its relationship to its surrounding. Every Os atom forms the shared corner of two Os tetrahedra in a network. The exchange pathways to the nearest neighbors, leading by one of the coordinating oxygen atoms, are shown by dashed lines. The pathways form an Os -O -Os angle of 139.4 \u2022 , the direct distance between the two Os being 3.58\u00c5. The Rb cations are omited in this illustration for clarity. To our knowledge, the B -O -B angle in RbOs 2 O 6 is surpassed only by one other pyrochlore, the bulk superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7.   Together with the high density of states at the Fermi level in this compound, we expect the large B -O -B angle to play a crucial role in the tendency to superconduct.It would therefore be interesting to know how it compares to the corresponding angle in KOs 2 O 6 . Formally, the oxidation state of the osmium ion is either 5.5+ as in Rb + Os 5.5+ 2 O 2\u2212 6 or 50 % 5+ and 50 % 6+ as in Rb + Os 5+ Os 6+ O 2\u2212 6 .  Since the ground state configuration of osmium is [Xe]4f 14 5d 6 6s 2 , one would expect the Os 5+ to be in a spin S = 3/2 state, while Os 6+ is in a spin S = 1 state. Band structure calculations for Cd 2 (Os,Re) 2 O 7 , show that the crystal field well separates the 5d e g and t 2g bands from each other. The 5d manifold is also well separated from the O 2p band. Although the Os 16c site has trigonal symmetry, this part of the crystal field is weak and there is no further splitting of the t 2g manifold.However, the electronic situation in RbOs 2 O 6 is expected to be quite different from Cd 2 (Os,Re) 2 O 7:"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This might be interpreted as a sign of an unconventional superconducting state with part of the Fermi surface ungapped.  Alternatively, if part of the sample does not undergo a superconducting transition, then the measured curve is the sum of the superconducting and normal contributions.  Indeed, such an analysis appears to yield consistent results, suggesting a conventional BCS-like superconducting state.Following the second interpretation, we proceed to further analyze C p below T c .  Starting with the 12 T data as the normal state reference, we subtract 23.4 % of it (shown in the inset of Fig. ) from the 0 T set. Correspondingly, the superconducting volume fraction is about 77 %, similar to the estimated fraction in KOs 2 O 6 . The resulting specific heat for the superconducting part is shown in Fig. on a semilogarithmic scale vs. T c /T .  The line indicates the expected behavior from BCS assuming an isotropic gap : For 2.5 < T c /T < 6, the specific heat approximately follows an exponential behavior 8.5 \u03b3 T c exp(\u22121.44 T c /T ).  Down to 1 K, the specific heat in the superconducting state decreases in close quantitative agreement with conventional superconducting behavior.Below that, the subtraction of the two components provides unreliable results, since the difference becomes exceedingly small.Furthermore, impurities play an essential role at such low temperatures, and it is thus difficult to draw conclusions from the observed deviation.It will be worthwhile to elucidate the microscopic origin of the roughly 20 % ungapped fraction, which is observed both in RbOs 2 O 6 and KOs 2 O 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This is in sharp contrast to KOs 2 O 6, where the critical field seems to exceed the Pauli limit .  A power law fit H c2 (T ) = H c2 (0)(1 \u2212 (T /T c ) n ) (dashed line) gives an exponent of n = 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 and a critical temperature T c = (6.37 \u00b1 0.03) K.

The upper critical field of a superconductor is determined by the combined effect of an external magnetic field on the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the conduction electrons.  Werthamer et al. have worked out a theory for H c2 which includes both spin and orbital paramagnetic effects as well as nonmagnetic and spin-orbit scattering . In RbOs 2 O 6 , the upper critical field does not, however, behave as predicted by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula in the dirty limit, as can be seen in Fig .The initial slope of the critical boundary at T c results in a Maki-parameter \u03b1 = \u22120.52758 K/T \u00d7 d(\u00b5 0 H c2 )/dT | T =Tc = 0.64 \u00b1 0.1 . Spin contributions to the energy balance of a superconductor become important when \u03b1 1.

These layers act as separators, in effect defining the CuO 2 planes, and also often as charge reservoirs to control the hole or electron concentration. In the past two years the discovery of new cuprate superconductors has become more difficult, as simple combinations of elements and standard processing techniques have become exhausted in the search.  Complex chemis- try, high oxygen pressures or high hydrostatic pres- sures have been employed recently to discover new materials . Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity at 28 K in Sr 2 Nd 1.5 Ce 0.5 NbCu 2 -O 10-\u03b4 (and the Ta analog), a previously reported compound with a single Nb(Ta)O 6 octahedral layer between the apices of pyramidal (CuO 5 ) \u221e planes.  The bases of the pyramids are separated by a fluorite layer ().The Nb(Ta)O 6 octahedral layer is a new kind of intermediary layer for high-T c copper oxides, and the Nb and Ta charges of +5 are the highest yet on cations to be accommodated in such a layer. The (Nb, Ta-O) octahedral layers join (Tl-O) and (Pb, Cu-O) octahedral layers, (PbO-Cu-PbO) and (Bi-O) distorted pyramids, Cu-O sticks and chains, and possibly GaO 4 tetrahedra , as building blocks for new materials.  The oc- tahedra in the new layer share corners, not edges as in (Tl-O) and (Pb, Cu-O) octahedral intermediary layers.The compound is a good bulk superconductor only for a narrow range of compositions and con- ditions of oxygen pressure, temperature, reaction time and cooling rate, striking a delicate balance among solid solubility, cation ordering, and oxygen content in the determination of its properties."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Starting materials were SrCO 3 , freshly dried Nd 2 O 3 , Ce 2 (C 2 O 4 ) 3 \u00b79H 2 O, Nb 2 O 5 (Ta 2 O 5 ) and CuO, mixed to yield Sr 2 Nd 2-x Ce x NbCu 2 O 10 for 0.4 x 0.7, \u2206x=0.05, based on the earlier reported composition of the phase and the expected optimal con- centration for superconductivity, x 0.6 (which cor- responds to a nominal hole concentration of 0.2/Cu).  The phase had been reported to be semiconducting in this composition range, although some resistive Ta based samples showed a peak in \u03c1(T) near 60 K which was attributed either to a magnetic transition or filamentary superconductivity . Our initial mixtures were heated at 200\u00b0/min to 1000\u00b0C in flowing O 2 and then heated at that temperature in O 2 for 70-90 h with 2 intermediate mechanical grind- ings.  Powders were then pressed into pellets and sub- jected to a variety of treatments .The pro- cessing procedures were designed in the attempt to separate the effects of phase purity, cation order/dis- order, and oxygen stoichiometry in the attainment of superconducting material. Although small amounts of superconductivity were observed for many pro- cessing procedures, only under a narrow set of con- ditions was bulk superconductivity obtained in es- sentially single phase material, allowing identification of the Sr 2 Nd 2-x Ce x NbCu 2 O 10 type phase as a bulk superconductor. Optimal Ce concentrations were found to be between x=0.5 and 0.6.  The best pro- cessing involved long treatment times (60 h or more) at temperatures of 1100-1125\u00b0C in an oxygen or 25 atmosphere oxygen ambient with cooling in the furnace to 500\u00b0C before removal.The 25\u00b0 temper- ature window between 1100 and 1125\u00b0C, long treat- ment times, and cooling rate are all critical to the at- tainment of good quality material."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The disappearance of superconductivity in all good materials, however, was always accompanied by a small weight loss. Treatment of good superconduct- ing Sr 2 Nd 1.5 Ce 0.5 NbCu 2 O 10-\u03b4 (prepared at 1125\u00b0C, 25 atm O 2 ) for 4 h at 600\u00b0C in N 2 resulted in a weight loss of 0.25% (and single phase material) corre- sponding to an oxygen loss of approximately 0.13 per formula unit, or 0.13 holes per copper, and the loss of superconductivity. This indicated, along with the introduction of superconductivity in poor samples by re-treatment in O 2 , that the oxygen content of the phase is a critical parameter. Determination of the absolute oxygen content of the material is difficult because Nb 2 O 5 and CeO 2 are only partially reduca- ble (not to stoichiometric oxides) on heating in the TGA to 1000\u00b0 in H 2 , our standard method for ox- ygen content determination. Finely powdered ma- terial can, however, be reduced in a 5% H 2 -95% N 2 mixture at 500\u00b0C, a temperature where CeO 2 and Nb 2 O 5 will not lose any oxygen on heating.  Reduc- tion of Sr 2 Nd 1.5 Ce 0.5 NbCu 2 O 10-\u03b4 prepared at 1125\u00b0C and 25 atm O 2 pressure indicated that \u03b4=0.05 , yielding an approximate doping of 0.2 holes/copper; near the optimal expected value. The weight loss data are shown in .

All samples of Na z' Co 1-x M x O 2 (M=Ir and Ga) thus obtained were found to have the CdI 2 structure (P6 3 /mmc) by X-ray powder diffraction with FeK\u00e1 radiation, where any impurity phases have not been observed for the small values of the nominal concentration x studied here. The lattice parameter c determined by the X-ray studies changed systematically with x for M=Ir, which guarantees that the substitution is successfully carried out. For M=Ga, the lattice parameter c exhibits rather large scattering as a function of x. However, because it shows, roughly speaking, a decreasing tendency with increasing x and because the resistivity \u03c1 and the transition temperature T c of the system exhibit, as shown later, systematic x dependence, it can be considered that the substitution is carried out. (In the actual experiments, besides M=Ir and Ga, several atomic elements such as Cu and Al, for example, were tried to substitute for Co.  But, we could not find a firm experimental evidence that these elements really substitute for Co:  The lattice parameter did not show systematic dependence on the nominal value x.The absolute value and the T-dependence of the resistivity \u03c1 did not change systematically with x, either.  (The superconduting transition temperature was almost independent of the nominal values of x.)  Then, the obtained data of the doping dependence of T c on x are, we think, reliable only for M=Ir and Ga.  (For M=Rh, the data may also be reliable.) and here these data are presented.We employed a \"rapid heat-up\" technique to avoid the Na evaporation.  For each sample series obtained through a single series of the processes, the c values were determined by using 5-6 lines between the scattering angles of 20-90\u00ba, and the results are shown in Figs. 1 and 5 for M=Ir and for Ga. The c values at x=0 are found to be different among these series probably due to the difference of the real Na concentration, which depends on the preparation conditions such as the sintering temperature T a . (The lattice parameter c decreases with the Na concentration. ) For each series of samples, c increases with increasing x. The lattice parameter a is rather insensitive to x.The resistivity \u03c1 of Na z' Co 1-x M x O 2 was measured by the four terminal method.These samples were dried at 150~800 \u00b0C before the measurements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

However, the initial slope |dT c /dx| is almost equal to the value observed for the series A.Then, we think that even though the magnitudes of the shield ing diamagnetism are different between two series of A and B, we are observing intrinsic behavior of the T c-x curve."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Because the data do not indicate the increase of the number of magnetic moments with increasing x, the impurities can be considered to be non-magnetic, which is naturally expected, because non-magnetic Co atoms are substituted with the isoelectronic Ir atoms or with Ga atoms which have only s and p outer electrons. If the superconducting gap parameter has the s-wave symmetry, T c should not, in an ideal case, be suppressed by the present doping. It is interesting to compare the values of |dT c /dx| with those of other systems. In Fig. 14, we summarize the T c -x curves obtained in the present experiments together with those of well known systems, La 1.85 Sr 0.15 Cu 1-x Zn x O 4 26) with the d-wave order parameter and Mg(B 1-x C x ) 2 with the s-wave one. 27) The slopes |dT c /dx| observed for the present sample series have the values similar to that of the Mg(B 1-x C x ) 2 system and much smaller than that of La 1.85 Sr 0.15 Cu 1-x Zn x O 4 .   It may be also useful to note that the values of |dT c /dx| observed for the spinel system Cu(Co 1-x M x ) 2 S 4 are ~0.9 and ~0.6, for M=Rh and Ir, respectively. 28) The system is considered to have the s-wave order parameter from the existence of a significant coherence peak in the T-dependence of the nuclear relaxation rate divided by T, 1/T 1 T. 29) It has the three dimensional network of the corner-sharing (Co 1-x M x ) 4 and can be considered to be a three dimensional version of the triangular lattice. For this system, |dT c /dx| is more than a half of that of Na z Co 1-x Ir x O 2 \u22c5yH 2 O.From these results, it is tempting to consider that the present system has the s-wave order parameter and that the linear relationship between T c and x is just caused by a mechanism different from the pair breaking due to the scattering by non-magnetic impurities. On the other hand, within the framework of the pair breaking theory, the relations {T c (0)-T c (x)} ~\u03c0h/4\u03b7k B \u03c4~\u03c0 2 T c (0)\u03b1(x)/4~0.44\u03c0 2 (\u03be/\u039b\u03b7)\u00d7T c (0) hold in the region of small x (Note that \u03be\u00d7T c (0) does not depend on T c (0). ).   To explain the initial slope |dT c /dx| ~1 K/%, \u03be/(\u039b\u03b7)= hv F /{1.76\u03c0k B T c (0)}/( v F \u03c4) should be of the order of ~1/20.  If \u03be is chosen to be ~100 \u00c5, 10) \u039b has to be as large as 1000 \u00c5 at x=0.01, which seems to be too large as compared with the average separation of neighboring impurities (~30 \u00c5).The much smaller values of |dT c /dx| for the present systems than that of La 1.85 Sr 0.15 Cu 1-x Zn x O 4 do not seem to be easily understood only by the naive consideration of the pair breaking by non-magnetic impurities, either Then, what is the primary mechanism of the observed T c suppression? It is, roughly speaking, to be linear in x, but the rate |dT c /dx| seems to be too small to understand by the pair breaking mechanism. We may have to ask why Cu(Co 1-x M x ) 2 S 4 with the s-symmetry of the order parameter exhibits the linear T c -decrease in x, 28) because the similar origin of the T c suppression may be relevant to the present case. For example, effects of the carrier localization on T c may be considered as one of possible origins, because for M=Ir, the relatively small amount of the doping to the host material Na z' CoO 2 seems to induce the upturn of the resistivity with decreasing T (see Figs. 2 and 6).Before summarizing the results of the present study, we also add followings. 30) The Knight shifts K y studied as functions of T at several fixed H values (1.5 T \u2264 H \u2264 4.5 T) indicate that the spin susceptibility decreases with decreasing T below T c .  The H-and T-dependences of K y cannot be explained by considering the superconducting diamagnetism, as reported in our previous paper. 8) The magnetic field H c2 determined from the T dependence of K y reproduces the H c2 -T curve for H applied within the c plane reported in ref. 10. The H c2 value at T\u21920 can be understood by the effect of the Zeeman splitting on singlet pairs, indicating again that the superconducting pairs are definitely in the singlet state.It gives a restriction that the pairs have even parity.In order to fully understand the observed values of |dT c /dx|, we have to examine various quantities and study the electronic state of the present system in detail.In summary, we have presented the results of the studies on the impurity-doping effects on T c of Na z CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O and shown that the values of |dT c /dx| are ~1 K/%, which is too small to be explained by the pair breaking mechanism for the anisotropic (l\u22600) order parameters by non-magnetic impurities."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In addition to the relatively small specific heat jump, the low temperature zero magnetic field C/T data do not appear to extrapolate to zero, which should be the case if all the electrons are in the superconducting state.  This could be an artifact of our data not extending to sufficiently low temperatures, but it is difficult to imagine a reasonable extrapolation which would lead to zero specific heat as T \u2192 0. One possible explanation for these data is that some of the measured specific heat is associated with the frozen water in our samples. The superconducting phase contains 1.3 mol H 2 O per formula unit, and the samples presumably also contain a small weight percentage of free water adsorbed between the grains ( < 10%).  To estimate the effect on the measured specific heat, we approximate the contribution of the crystal water in Na 0.3 CoO 2 \u20221.3H 2 O to be similar to that of pure ice.The heat capacity of ice in the 2-3 K range is 0.8-1.5 mJ/mol-K 2 .

Similar observations in early work on Sr 2 RuO 4 were first used to support the exotic origin for the superconductivity, but improvement in sample quality eventually led to observations of a nearly zero residual specific heat at T = 0 .  Although an unconventional microscopic mechanism cannot be ruled out as the origin for the non-BCS specific heat behavior at T c , the simplest explanation is that there is a chemical inhomogeneity in our samples despite the large and relatively sharp peak in C(T)/T.  The C/T data below the peak appear to be linear in temperature rather than concave upwards, suggesting a spread in transition temperatures below 4.2 K.Based on our understanding of the complex chemistry of this material, the most likely explanation of these data is that there are slight inhomogeneities in the Na content, since T c is very sensitive to the Na concentration ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

An increase in the La concentration z in this system leads to a smaller den- sity of holes in the CuO 2 planes, and the optimum T c is achieved with z \u2243 0.4.  In this paper, we report our systematic measurements of S(290K) and R H (T ) for a series of BSLCO single crystals, for which z is varied from 0.2 to 1.0.

This is a strong indication that the \"universal\" relation does not hold in the BSLCO system and thus one should not use this relation to determine p.We therefore tried to use the temperature-dependent R H for the determination of p.

Remember that there is a tendency that \u03c1 0 be- comes systematically larger with increasing La doping, as shown in Fig. .  This suggests that one possi- ble reason for the disappearance of superconductivity at z \u2243 0.9 (which corresponds to p = 0.09 -0.10) is the increased disorder in the heavily-La-doped crystals. In other words, in our BSLCO samples the superconductiv- ity is more significantly suppressed in more underdoped samples because of the larger amount of disorder probed by \u03c1 0 .The microscopic origin of this disorder triggered by heavy La doping is yet to be elucidated; it is difficult to imagine that the random potential produced by the replacement of Sr with La itself is responsible to produce \u03c1 0 of as large as 400 \u00b5\u2126cm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The temperature dependence of the energy of the La/Sr and apex oxygen phonons at \u223c2.8 GPa, for the La 1.93 Sr 0.07 CuO 4 compound. CuO 6 octahedra is very small (or even zero) and the orthorhombicity has been suppressed with pressure. Therefore, the T ot in this case must be less than 77 K for both samples studied. At ambient pressure certain new modes appear at \u223c150 cm \u22121 , \u223c280 cm \u22121 , and \u223c370 cm \u22121 mainly in the superconducting doping region and at low temperatures . These modes have been attributed to IR phonons activated in the Raman spectra from the breaking of the inversion symmetry . At high hydrostatic pressures only traces of the \u223c150 cm \u22121 band can be seen at very low temperatures (Figs. ). On the other hand, the intensity of the other IR mode at \u223c370 cm \u22121 increases considerable in the high pressure low temperature spectra and becomes even stronger than the apical oxygen (Figs. ). Since the mode has an increased width at high pressures and it is mixed with the \u223c280 cm \u22121 broad band, no quantitative conclusions can be drawn for its pressure and temperature dependence. Since the three new bands are related with IR phonons of different symmetry, the data may indicate that the high pressure alters the local symmetry and affects the intermediate phase marked by the appearance of the IR modes, which is formed above T c.  It should be mentioned the considerable increase with pressure in the intensity of the B 3g mode at \u223c480 cm \u22121 of the planar oxygen atoms.This apparently reflects a charge redistribution that occurs at high pressures and reduces the screening of certain phonons within the CuO 2 planes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

It was anticipated at a very early stage that electron-electron interactions are controlled by the Hund's rule coupling , and it was later shown within the dynamical mean-field theory that the electrons are subject to strong Hund's rule correlations, while the system remains metallic and far from the Mott insulator regime . Mean-field density-functional theory (DFT) cal- culations within the generalized-gradient approximation are unstable against ferromagnetism .

The standard calculations, such as those presented in Ref. , are unstable against spontaneous formation of a ferromagnetic state. The tendency toward this instability is reduced somewhat arbitrarily by scaling the Hund's coupling by half. This ensures numerically stable calcu- lations in external fields up to at least 5 T, even at \u03b5 aa \u00bc \u03b5 v . The impact of the reduced Hund's coupling appears to produce systematic errors in related absolute parameters but less so for the relative changes induced by strain. For example, for the selected scaling, indicates that the calculated \u03c7 DFT s \u00f0\u03b5 aa \u00bc 0\u00de renormalization is approximately 1.6, whereas the known correlation-induced mass enhance- ment is about 3.5 . Therefore, the downscaling is too strong. Given this caveat, at the critical strain, \u03c7 DFT s \u00f0\u03b5 aa \u00bc \u03b5 v \u00de is enhanced over \u03c7 DFT s \u00f0\u03b5 aa \u00bc 0\u00de by about 70%, while S\u00f0\u03b5 v \u00de itself is enhanced by a much smaller factor, about 30% over S\u00f00\u00de [right frame of ]. The scaling for the shifts should follow approximately these factors. Namely, the enhancement of K 1k is expected to scale with \u03c7 s , and therefore, of order 70%, whereas the enhancement of K 1 0 \u22a5 being sensitive to enhancement of S is expected to be much smaller, of order 30%. The former enhancement matches the data in well, as well as the calculations presented in .

Interestingly, for the orbital part of K 1c , and to some extent, of K 1 0 c , the calculations predict a sizeable enhancement, suggesting that the van Vleck contribution is not dominant, or, at least, less prominent here than for the in-plane fields, and, conversely, the SOC induces sizeable orbital Knight shifts.

Overdoping was accomplished using stainless-steel cells sealed with the sample immersed in liquid oxygen . The critical temperature of the samples was determined from the magnetization which showed sharp transitions.  Tunneling measurements were done with a point contact apparatus . The Bi-2212 crystal is cleaved along the ab-plane and mounted on a substrate so that the tip approaches along the c-axis.  A novel method is used to form the SIS break junctions.A differential micrometer-driven Au tip approaches the sample at LHe temperature and superconductor-insulator-normal- metal (SIN) junctions are first formed. These conductances exhibit quasiparticle peaks at eV \u223c \u00b1\u2206 and clearly show the standard dip and hump features above \u2206 in the occupied part of the DOS . Further increasing the force of the tip leads to an Ohmic contact (less than 10 ohm) with the crystal and a mechanical bond. A Bi-2212 piece is easily dislodged by cleaving along the double Bi-O layer. As a result of this process, an SIS junction forms between the Bi-2212 piece and the rest of the crystal.  The SIS conductances show quasiparticle peaks at \u00b12\u2206 that are consistent with the \u2206 value obtained from the SIN junctions. Additionally, the SIS conductances also show a symmetric dip, hump and background, and also the presence of a Josephson current. The magnitude of this current generally decreases as the junction resistance increases. (a) shows the temperature dependence of the tunneling conductance for junction # 1 on the heavily overdoped Bi-2212. The 4.2 K data show a tunneling conductance of a Bi-2212 break junction with sharp quasiparticle peaks at \u00b12\u2206, a weak Josephson current peak at zero bias, and the dip and hump features above \u00b12\u2206.  One of the distinct features of this junction is the relatively flat background. This is different than the typical SIS conduc- tances found from optimally doped and overdoped Bi-2212 that show a decreasing background up to \u00b1350 meV. For SIS junctions at low temperatures, the thermal smearing is minimal and the quasiparticle peaks can be used to estimate the energy gap size, which is 14 meV for the 4.2 K spectra in , giving a coupling ratio 2\u2206/kT c \u223c 5.8.A set of temperature-dependent data for another SIS break junction (junction # 2) of Bi-2212 is shown in .Although the junction resistance in is approximately the same"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

One may assume that increasing hole doping makes the Bi-2212 normal-state more Fermi-liquid-like, leading possibly to an s-wave BCS super- conductor. There are ARPES observations that suggest s-wave BCS behavior in the heavily overdoped phase . However, the tunneling subgap conductance shapes at low tempera- tures in figs. 1(a) and (b) are not consistent with the s-wave BCS theory prediction which is supposed to be flat near zero bias. Here what we observed is that the d-wave-like sub- gap structure persists at the T c = 56 K overdoped Bi-2212. shows the normalized tunneling conductance of SIS break junction # 1 at 4.2 K (dots) which is given in .  Since the tunneling conductance is flat above T c , the data have been normalized by a con- stant. The fit is generated using a d-wave gap function, \u2206 = \u2206 0 cos(2\u03b8), in the BCS DOS, Here, \u0393 is a smearing parameter to account for quasiparticle lifetime.  The SIS conductance is calculated by where c is a proportionality constant.F (E) is the Fermi function. The formula also includes a directionality function f (\u03b8)=1+\u03b1 cos(4\u03b8) which corresponds to a preferred tunneling along the d-wave lobes. Here \u03b1 is the directionality strength, which is assumed temperature independent (\u03b1 = 0.4) . The fit (solid line in ) shows good agreement in the subgap region with the experimental data. Thus there appears to be no change of symmetry away from d-wave. However for |eV | > 2\u2206 the data deviate from the BCS d-wave fit, exhibiting broader peak widths and the dip feature. In general, these features are compensating which allows conservation of states; however, the data in lead to an integrated area out to 150 meV which is about 6% above the BCS d-wave fit. We attribute the discrepancy to the inability to accurately know the background conductance at 4.2 K. The broad peaks and dip feature are observed throughout the doping range and have been attributed to strong-coupling effects ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This unusual effect seems to be tied to the presence of a pseudogap.In the present study, we show that the gap magnitude for heavily overdoped Bi-2212 shows no anomalies near T c but continues to decrease and appears to close near the bulk T c value. and (c) shows the d-wave fit for T c = 48 K and 55 K. The tunneling conductance in the displays peak values near 30 meV, however, the best fit for (b) corresponds to \u2206 = 9 meV and \u0393 = 13 meV, so the energy gap is smaller than obtained value at 4.2 K.   For 55 K, we plot fits using different \u2206 and \u0393 values in (c) to prove that the gap is very small around T c .The data are in good agreement with a fit using \u2206 = 4 meV and \u0393 = 18 meV.These results show the energy gap magnitude reduces with increasing temperature as indicated in and appears to close at the bulk T c."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Here T * is obtained from various experimental techniques including SIS break junctions using STM . Extrapolating T * to the overdoped phase suggests that T c and T * are very close and might even merge in the overdoped region.  This might be the reason that we do not observe a pseudogap in our tunneling studies. The implication of the doping dependence of superconducting energy gap and T * is that they are intimately related. The simplest notion is that T * represents the mean-field temperature for pairing, whereas T c defines when long- range phase coherence is established. However, if the two temperatures were distinct over the entire doping range, then that would suggest that T * corresponds to physics distinct from superconductivity. Our present result suggests that there is a particular doping value where the two temperature scales merge and this provides further support for pseudogap models based on superconducting fluctuations ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The Bardeen-Cooper- Schrieffer (BCS) theory explains the unique properties of superconductors 4 and guides materials design for achieving a higher superconducting transition temperature (TC) under the criterion of the large electron-phonon coupling constant (lep). Magnesium diboride with TC = 39 K has been discovered using this strategy 5 .   A further increase in lep is ineffective in enhancing TC because the localization of electron pairs in real space results in the formation of a charge density wave, and the highest TC considered within the BCS theory is approximately 40 K. This BCS wall has been easily overcome with the demonstration of perovskite-type copper oxides 6 .Unconventional materials, including fullerenes 7 and iron pnictides 8 , have reigned over the class of high-TC superconductors. However, a conventional superconductor (sulphur hydride) recently created a new record of TC = 203 K under an ultra-high pressure 9 .   Such old materials but new superconductors are again attracting significant attention 10 .    Here, we report new superconductors produced from higher titanium oxides, which are Ti4O7 and g-Ti3O5 films synthesized using advanced epitaxial growth on specific oxide substrates.Their TC are 3.0 and 7.1 K, respectively.The latter is the highest known value among simple oxides.The temperature dependence of resistivity strongly depended on the growth 3 atmosphere.Higher titanium-oxide films grown under a more oxidative condition exhibited metal-insulator transition accompanied by clear hysteresis at ~150 K.The insulating phase was suppressed in the films grown under a less oxidative condition, and the superconducting phase appeared at low temperatures.These results and the previous theoretical prediction suggest that oxygen non-stoichiometry and epitaxial stabilization play key roles in the realization of bipolaronic superconductivity in these titanium oxides."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The out-of-plane XRD patterns showed intense reflections from the Ti4O7 films grown on (LaAlO3)0. 3-(SrAl0.5Ta0.5O3)0.7 (LSAT) (100) substrates and the g-Ti3O5 film grown on \u03b1-Al2O3 (0001) substrates (Figs. , respectively).  These substrates are insulating, non-magnetic, and exhibit high reduction resistance, providing advantages in the growth and search of a superconducting sample. However, because titanium oxides form various polymorphisms with different ratios of oxygen to titanium, their crystal structures must be carefully controlled and distinguished.  Pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) with a TiOx target (x ~ 1.5) was conducted at a high temperature to tune the degree of subtle oxidation by feeding a small amount of oxygen gas or even flowing inert Ar gas.Then, we used the tilt angle c-dependence of 2q-q XRD profiles to survey the asymmetric film reflections (see Figs. S1 and S5 in Supplemental Materials). Reflections coming from the substrate and film were found at characteristic c angles. Since the intensities of the film reflections were too weak to determine the d values of interplanar spacing distances precisely, synchrotron radiation XRD measurements were also performed (see Figs. S2, S3, and S6). From the d values and c angles, we identified the Miller indices as those listed in Tables .

In contrast, the insulating behaviours were strongly suppressed for the film grown under PAr = 1 \u00d7 10 -3 Torr; the upturn in resistivity was weak and no hysteresis was found over the temperature range.  If we account for the lower degree of oxidation at PAr = 1 \u00d7 10 -3 Torr, oxygen deficiency may be responsible for the suppression of the insulating states. Furthermore, superconductivity was observed at low temperatures.The Ti4O7 film grown under an intermediate condition (PAr = 1 \u00d7 10 -6 Torr) exhibited both hysteresis and superconducting characteristics in the resistivity curve.

The crystal has an alternate stacking of BiS2 and CeO layers, isostructural with those reported in the other BiCh2-based compounds.  Some selected bonding distances and angles are given in Fig. as the thermal ellipsoids representation and Table III. Bi atoms are bonded with S atoms in three kinds such as Bi-S1, inter-plane Bi-S2, and intra-plane Bi-S2 bondings. The interatomic distance of intra-plane Bi-S2 is much shorter and longer than that of inter-plane Bi-S2 (3.373(10) \u00c5) and Bi-S1 (2.514(8) \u00c5), respectively, with similar tendency to the BiCh2-based compounds [18-21]. The intra-plane S2-Bi-S2 angle in the CeOBiS2 crystals is 177.204(3)\u00b0. The Bi-S plane is less distorted compare to the Bi-Ch plane in the other F-doped BiCh2-based compounds [18,20,21].  As seen from Table III, the Bi-S plane in Ce(O,F)BiS2 is 179.630(3)\u00b0, which is flatter than that of CeOBiS2. The F-doping to the blocking layers in La(O,F)BiS2 increases the flatness in Bi-S plane, then stabilizes the crystal structure .The carrier numbers in the blocking layers may optimize the Bi-S plane.  Namely, the corrugation adjustment in the Bi-S plane seems to be driven by the charge transfer between Bi-S plane and the blocking layers.In the case of this study, valence fluctuant Ce atoms would change its valence state with the structural optimization."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The single crystals show superconductivity with zero resistivity at ~1.3 K under ambient pressure.   The onset temperature of superconducting transition was enhanced up to ~3.8 K by applying hydrostatic pressure.The superconducting anisotropic parameter was determined to be 2.3 from its upper critical magnetic field.The less anisotropic character in the compound will be expected to reveal by means of some electronic structural studies such as ab-initio calculations, and/or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The highest T c that has been achieved to date is in the copper oxide system : 133 kelvin at ambient pressure and 164 kelvin at high pressures .    As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional superconduc- tors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition tempera- tures by this route are not clear.In contrast, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide for achieving high T c with no theoretical upper bound-all that is needed is a favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon coupling, and a high density of states . These conditions can in principle be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen , as hydrogen atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron-phonon coupling.Numerous calculations support this idea and have predicted transition temperatures in the range 50-235 kelvin for many hydrides , but only a moderate T c of 17 kelvin has been observed experimentally . Here we investigate sulfur hydride , where a T c of 80 kelvin has been predicted .    We find that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approxi- mately 90 gigapascals.On cooling, we see signatures of supercon- ductivity: a sharp drop of the resistivity to zero and a decrease of the transition temperature with magnetic field, with magnetic sus- ceptibility measurements confirming a T c of 203 kelvin.Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of T c in sulfur deuteride is suggestive of an electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is con- sistent with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer scenario.We argue that the phase responsible for high-T c superconductivity in this system is likely to be H 3 S, formed from H 2 S by decomposition under pressure.These findings raise hope for the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other hydro- gen-based materials."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Further calculations showed that metallic hydrogen should be a superconductor with a very high T c of about 100-240 K for molecular hydrogen, and of 300-350 K in the atomic phase at 500 GPa (ref. ) .    However, superconductivity in pure hydrogen has not yet been found, even though a conductive and prob- ably semimetallic state of hydrogen has been recently produced . Hydrogen-dominated materials such as covalent hydrides SiH 4 , SnH 4 , and so on might also be good candidates for showing high-T c superconductivity .Similarly to pure hydrogen, they have high Debye temperatures. Moreover, heavier elements might be beneficial as they contribute to the low frequencies that enhance electron-phonon coup- ling.Importantly, lower pressures are required to metallize hydrides in comparison to pure hydrogen.

At the next increase of pressure at low temperatures of T , 100 K, T c steadily increases with pressure. However, at pressures of .160 GPa, T c increases sharply . As higher temperatures of 150-250 K were involved in this pressure range, we supposed that the increase of T c and the decrease of sample resistance during warming ) could indicate a possible kinetic-controlled phase transformation.  Therefore in further experiments, after loading and after the initial pressure increase at 200 K, we annealed all samples by heating them to room temperature (or above) at pressures of .,150 GPa , see also Extended Data ). This allowed us to obtain stable results, to compare different isotopes, to obtain the dependence of T c on pressure and magnetic field, and to prove the existence of supercon- ductivity in our samples as follows.(We note that additional informa- tion on experimental conditions are given in the appropriate figure legends.) (1) There is a sharp drop in resistivity with cooling, indicating a phase transformation.

However superconductivity with T c <200 K does not follow from these calculations.We suppose that it relates to the decomposition of H 2 S, as high temperatures are required to reach the high T c .  Precipitation of elemental sulfur on decomposition could be expected (which is well known at low pres- sures of P , 100 GPa; ref. 14); however the superconducting transition in elemental sulfur occurs at significantly lower temperatures .  Another expected product of decomposition of H 2 S is hydrogen. However, the strong characteristic vibrational stretching mode from the H 2 molecule was never observed in our Raman spectra (nor was it observed in ref. 14).  Therefore we suppose that the dissociation of H 2 S is different and involves the creation of higher hydrides, such as 3H 2 S R H 6 S 1 2S or 2H 2 S R H 4 S 1 S. It is natural to expect these reactions, as sulfur can be not only divalent, but also exhibits higher valencies.  In fact, calculations indirectly support this hypothesis, as the dissoci- ation H 2 S R H 2 1 S was shown to be energetically very unfavourable.We found further theoretical support in ref. . In that work, the van der Waals compound 21 (H 2 S) 2 H 2 was considered, and it was shown that at pressures above 180 GPa it forms an Im-3m structure with H 3 S stoichiometry.  The predicted T c < 190 K and its pressure dependences are close to our experimental values ).Our hypothesis of the transformation of H 2 S to higher hydrides (in the H 3 S stoichiometry each S atom is surrounded by 6 hydrogen atoms) is strongly supported by further calculations .All the numerous works based on the Im-3m structure are consistent in their prediction of T c .,200 K, which decreases with pressure.The hydrogen sublattice gives the main contribution to superconductivity .Inclusion of zero point vibra- tions and anharmonicity in the calculations corrected the calculated T c to ,190 K, and the isotope coefficient from a 5 0.5 to a 5 0.35- both in agreement with the present work."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For electrical measurements we used diamond anvil cells (DACs) with anvils of the following shape: tip diameter of 200-300 mm bevelled at 7-8u to a culet of 40-80 mm. An insulating gasket is required to separate the metallic gasket from the electrodes. It was prepared in the following way (Extended . First a metallic gasket of T301 stainless steel (or Re) 250 mm thick was indented with about 17-20 GPa pressure. Then the bottom of the imprint of diameter ,200 mm was drilled out, and a powder insulating material was put in the imprint and pressed between the anvils to form a layer. The insulating layer was made of either Teflon, NaCl or CaSO 4 as these materials do not react with H 2 S. The layer was pressed to obtain a thickness in the centre of ,3-5 mm to provide stable clamping. A larger thickness leads to instability in the sample-it shifts or escapes under pressure-while with a thinner gasket it is difficult to reach high pressures. A hole of diameter ,10-30 mm was then drilled in the insulating layer. Four Ti electrodes were sputtered on the diamond anvil. The electrodes were capped with Au to prevent oxidation of the Ti. (To check a possible contribution of the diamond surface to the conductivity, we prepared a different configuration of electrodes for a once-only experiment: two electrodes were sput- tered on one anvil and another two on another anvil, similar to ref. . After preparation of the electrodes the gasket was put back on the anvil and the DAC was assembled so that the separation between the anvils was about 20-100 mm (mea- sured by interference fringes). The DAC was placed into a cryostat and cooled down to ,200 K (within the temperature range of liquid H 2 S) and then H 2 S gas was put through a capillary into a rim around the diamond anvil where it liquefied (Extended Data ).  H 2 S of 99.5% and D 2 S of 97% purity were been used. The filling was monitored visually (Extended Data Figs 4, 5) and the sample was identified by measuring Raman spectra. Then liquid H 2 S was clamped in the gasket hole by pushing the piston of the DAC with the aid of screws outside the cryostat.  The thickness of the sample can be estimated to be few micrometres, as measured from interference spectra through the clamped transparent sample.The thickness might be ,1 mm if the sample expanded over the culet . After the clamping, the DAC was heated to ,220 K to evaporate the rest of the H 2 S, and then the pressure was further increased at this temperature. The pressure remained stable during the cooling within 65 GPa.  The pressure was determined by a diamond edge scale at room temperature and low temperatures 32 . For optical measurements a Raman spectrometer was equipped with a nitrogen-cooled CCD and notch filters.The 632.8 nm line of a He-Ne laser was used to excite the Raman spectra and to determine pressure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Inset, optical micrograph of a sulfur hydride sample at 155 GPa in a CaSO 4 gasket (scale bar 100 mm). The high T onset 5 203 K measured from the susceptibility can be explained by a significant input to the signal from the periphery of the sample which expanded beyond the culet where pressure is smaller than in the culet centre (T c increases with decreasing pressure ).   b, Non-magnetic diamond anvil cell (DAC) of diameter 8.8 mm.  c, Magnetization measurements M(H) of sulfur hydride at a pressure of 155 GPa at different temperatures (given as curve labels).The magnetization curves show hysteresis, indicating a type II superconductor.     The magnetization curves are however distorted by obvious paramagnetic input (which is also observed in other superconductors ).In our case, the paramagnetic signal is probably from the DAC, but further study of the origin of this input is required. The paramagnetic background increases when temperature is decreased. The minima of the magnetization curves (,35 mT) are the result of the diamagnetic input from superconductivity and the paramagnetic background.The first critical field H c1 < 30 mT can be roughly estimated as the point where magnetization deviates from linear behaviour.At higher fields, magnetization increases due to the penetration of magnetic vortexes.As the sign of the field change reverses, the magnetic flux in the Shubnikov phase remains trapped and therefore the back run (that is, with decreasing field) is irreversible-the returning branch of the magnetic cycle (shown by filled points) runs above the direct one.Hysteretic behaviour of the magnetization becomes more clearly visible as the temperature decreases. d, At high temperatures T . 200 K, the magnetization decreases sharply.e, Extrapolation of the pronounced minima at the magnetization curves to higher temperatures gives the onset of superconductivity at T 5 203.5 K."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

A typical sample ) has a disk shape (diameter 50-100 mm and thickness of few micrometres). In the superconductive state the magnetic moment for this disk is estimated as M(disk) < 0.2r 3 H (ref. 33). For a disk of radius r 5 40 mm (a sample size typical for DACs in the megabar range) and H 5 2 mT the expected diamagnetic signal, M(disk) is estimated as 2.6 3 10 27 emu. This value is well above the sensitivity of the SQUID which is ,10 28 emu and, therefore, the signal can be detected. A high-pressure DAC made of Cu:Ti alloy has its own magnetic background signal (a) which increases sharply at low temperatures due to residual paramagnetic impurities.

The electronic gene is realized in the d 7 filling configuration of Co 2+ as we have proposed in ref. The successful syn- thesizations of the type of transition metal compounds were reported in the past. However, very few measurements have been made to study their electronic properties. Here we calculate their electronic and magnetic properties under the formula CuInM 2 (S, Se, Te) 4 with M = Mn, Fe, Co and Ni. In all these materials, the electronic physics near Fermi en- ergy stems from the M(S,Se,Te) 2 layer and is attributed to the d-orbitals of the transition metal elements. In the Co case, the three t 2g orbitals are near degenerate and close to half- filling, and make the dominating contribution near Fermi en- ergy. The (Mn,Fe,Co)-based compounds all have a checker- board (G-type) AFM insulating ground state while Ni-based compounds are paramagnetic metal. The AFM exchange in- teraction is the largest in the Co-based compounds.   This mag- netic trend from the Co to Ni based compounds is very simi- lar to those from Fe to Co-based pnictides in which a C-type AFM state appears in the Fe-based ones but vanishes in the Co-based ones.This result indicates that the Co-based parental compounds are multi-orbital Mott insulators. How- ever, upon electron doping, the magnetic long-range order can quickly be diminished and possible d-wave superconductivity can arise as we predicted in ref.  Experimental results appear to be consistent with our calculation results.The new materials closely resemble both cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and can bridge the gap between their elec- tronic properties.We believe that this family of materials can display a variety of novel electronic phases and can be a fertile new ground to study strongly correlated electronic physics."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The NN hopping parameters are slightly larger than those in ZnCoS 2 . In ref., we have argued that it is inevitable that the superconducting pairing symmetry in this model is a d- wave in which there should be gapless nodes along the diag- onal direction in the momentum space. To obtain a qualita- tive understanding of the d-wave sate, we can make a rough estimation by fixing the relative intra-orbital pairing strength for three orbitals according to their hopping energy scales. In Fig. , we draw the three orbital band structure of the effec- tive model in both folded and unfolded Brillouin zones and sketch the d-wave gap form factors in the momentum space by taking 1 3 \u2206 0 (cos(k x ) \u2212 cos(k y ) for d xy and \u2206 0 cos(k y ) for d yz , \u2212\u2206 0 cos(k x ) for d xz , where \u2206 0 is a superconducting gap parameter.

Here the effect could be even larger because the unit cell doubling in a d-wave pairing state can cause the mixture between two bands with opposite pairing signs, which is a destructive reconstruction for pairing. Therefore, for this family of Co-based materials, the material quality can be key factor in obtaining high-T c .Nevertheless, from T N > 400K, the energy scale of the AFM interactions is quite large.

At low temperatures, its temperature dependence is directly re- lated to the density of low energy quasiparticles, which in turn can be related to the anisotropy of the supercon- ducting energy gap on the Fermi surface. For investiga- tion of the low lying excitations and thus the anisotropy of the energy gap, the analysis is considerably less am- biguous if measurements are performed on high quality single crystal and temperatures well below T c /3. In this paper we report magnetic penetration depth measure- ments on single crystals B 0.63 K 0.37 BiO 3 (T c \u2248 31 K) down to 0.4 K.  The investigation of mechanisms of super- conductivity in B 1\u2212x K x BiO 3 (BKBO) system has been one of the important subjects in studies of high T c su- perconductivity in oxide materials. The significance of BKBO lies in observations that some of its supercon- ducting properties are consistent with the conventional s-wave isotropic superconductivity, but others are resem- bling high-T c cuprates.   In particular, substantial iso- tope effect , strong phonon contribution from the neutron scattering measurements , and a supercon- ducting gap with 2\u2206 0 /T c =3.5\u00b10.3 from the tunnelling and optical experiments indicate significant role of electron-phonon interactions in mechanism of su- perconductivity of BKBO.However the low density of states at the Fermi level with T c as high as 30K and insulator-superconductor transition by doping are similar to high-T c cuprates.However, in contrast to high T c cuprates which have two dimensional CuO 2 planes, BKBO has simple three dimensional cubic perovskite structure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Using an entropy-conserving construction, the jump \u2206C P = -121(1) mJ/mole K is estimated. The Ehrenfest relation provides the connection between the pressure derivative of T c , \u2206\u03b1, and \u2206C P (v is the molar volume). It has yielded dT c /dP in agreement with experiment for other superconductors .

To test the calculation via Eq. (1), dT c /dP was mea- sured on our sample using a purely hydrostatic method. Pressure was changed below 55 K and only one tran- sition (P = 0.63 GPa) was measured in solid helium. T c (P ) was determined from the midpoint of the super- conducting transition in the real part of the ac magnetic susceptibility. The data show that T c decreases at dT c /dP = -1.07(0.03) K/GPa, similar to prior reports .  This value is in excellent agreement with the value predicted by the Ehrenfest relation.This observation together with the continuous behavior of \u2206L/L 6K elim- inates the possibility of a significant lattice instability in MgB 2 for 6 K < T < 300 K."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We plotted the onset tem- perature of superconductivity, T onset c , and the transition width, \u2206T c = T onset c \u2212 T c .  The zero-resistance state is observed even in the narrow pressure range below P c . In the Fe-based superconductors, it is a controversial is- sue whether superconductivity can coexist with the AFM state. Since the resistivity is macroscopic measure- ment and is sensitive to superconductivity, it is generally difficult to discuss this issue.  However, note that \u2206T c is unusually wide below P c . In contrast, \u2206T c becomes markedly sharper above P c .The minimum \u2206T c is 0.75 K at 3.83 GPa.  This indicates that the PM state fa- vors superconductivity and that the AFM state prevents the occurrence of superconductivity in SrFe 2 As 2 . The su- perconductivity with a wide \u2206T c below P c implies non bulk superconductivity. The transition from the tetrag- onal structure to the orthorhombic one is of the first order. As seen in the inset of , the transition at T 0 is of the first order even close to P c . At high pres- sures and low temperatures, the pressure distribution is inevitable. If the transition at P c is of the first order, the pressure distribution is expected to induce phase separa- tion. We speculate that the observed superconductivity below P c originates from the phase-separated PM phase. This is supported by the fact that T onset c is almost in- dependent of pressure below P c . However, if the phase separation is realized at around P c , we expect the en- hancement of \u03c1 at low temperatures at around P c owing to scattering at the domain boundary. As shown in , there is no anomalous behavior in \u03c1(35K) at around P c within experimental error.The phase separation and co- existence of superconductivity and magnetism are still an open question, and confirmation by microscopic mea- surements is required."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For the Ca-substituted system, a possible supercon- ductivity was also reported in the weak-ferromagnetic compounds RuCa 2 RCu 2 O 8 (R = Pr-Gd). The metallic weak-ferromagnetic (WFM) order is originated from the long range order of Ru moments in the RuO 6 octahedra due to strong Ru-4d xy,yz,zx -O-2p x,y,z hybridization in this strongly-correlated electron sys- tem.  The Curie temperature T C \u223c 130 K observed from magnetization measurement in the prototype compound RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 is probably a canted G-type antiferromagnetic order with Ru 5+ moment \u00b5 canted along the tetragonal basal plane resulting a small net spontaneous magnetic moment \u00b5 s \u226a \u00b5(Ru 5+ ) too small to be detected in neutron diffraction.The occurrence of high-T c superconductivity with maximum resistivity onset T c (onset) \u223c 60 K in RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 is related with the quasi-two-dimensional CuO 2 bi- layers separated by a rare earth layer in the Ru-1212 structure.  Broad resistivity transition width \u2206T c = T c (onset) -T c (zero) \u223c 15-20 K observed is most likely originated from the coexistence and the inter- play between superconductivity and weak-ferromagnetic order.   The diamagnetic T c is observed anomalously at lower temperature near T c (zero) instead of at T c (onset), and a reasonable large Meissner signal was reported using stationary sample magnetometer with diamagnetic T c \u223c 30 K in \u2264 1 G applied field at zero-field-cooled (ZFC) mode.Lower T c (onset) \u223c 40 K and 12 K were observed for RuSr 2 EuCu 2 O 8 and RuSr 2 SmCu 2 O 8 , respectively.No superconductivity can be detected in RuSr 2 RCu 2 O 8 (R = Pr, Nd). 3,16 Superconducting RuSr 2 YCu 2 O 8 phase is stable only under the high pressure.The physics is still unclear in this system, and it will be interesting to investigate the effect of the weak- ferromagnetic order on superconducting critical fields B c2 and B c1 , as well as on the possible existence of a spon- taneous vortex state (SVS) at higher temperature above the Meissner state."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

However, recent scanning tunneling spectroscopic studies have shown that the pairing symmetry may be dependent on the hole-doping concentration, with \u0351d x 2 2y 2 1 s\u0352 mixed symmetries in certain overdoped cuprates such as \u0351Y 12x Ca x \u0352Ba 2 Cu 3 O 72d .  Furthermore, whether the pairing symmetry is d x 2 2y 2 or s wave in the one- layer n-type cuprates such as Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d and Pr 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d remains controversial , and it has been suggested that the pairing symmetry in the one-layer n-type cuprates may change from d x 2 2y 2 to s, depending on the electron doping level . The nonuniversal pairing symmetries in cuprate superconductors imply that the sym- metry is likely the result of competing orders rather than a sufficient condition for pairing.    Nonetheless, an important consequence of either d x 2 2y 2 or \u0351d x 2 2y 2 1 s\u0352-wave pairing is that the resulting nodal quasiparticles can interact strongly with the quantum impurities in the CuO 2 planes , such that a small concentration of impurities can give rise to strong suppression of superconductivity and modification of the collective Cu 21 spin excitations .In addition, Kondo effects could be induced by nonmagnetic impurities through breaking the nearest- neighbor antiferromagnetic Cu 21 -Cu 21 interaction . Such strong response to nonmagnetic impurities is in sharp contrast to conventional s-wave superconductivity .Despite significant progress in the studies of cuprate superconductivity, the research on the simplest form of cuprates, the infinite-layer system Sr 12x L x CuO 2 (L La, Gd, Sm), has been limited due to the difficulties in making single-phase samples with complete superconduct- ing volume.  Recently, Jung et al. have demonstrated single-phase samples of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 with nearly 100% superconducting volume and a sharp superconducting tran- sition temperature at T c 43 K, thus enabling reliable spectroscopic studies of the pairing symmetry and the ef- fects of quantum impurities. These single-phased infinite- layer cuprates are n-type with P4\u035emmm symmetry, which differ significantly from other cuprates in that no excess charge reservoir block exists between consecutive CuO 2 planes except a single layer of Sr(La), as illustrated in , suggesting stronger CuO 2 interplanar coupling.  Furthermore, the c-axis superconducting coherence length \u0351j c 0.53 nm\u0352 is found to be longer than the c-axis lattice constant \u0351c 0 0.347 nm\u0352 , in stark contrast to other cuprate superconductors with j c \u00f8 c 0 .Hence, the super- conducting properties of the infinite-layer system are ex- pected to be more three-dimensional, as opposed to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of all other cuprates.In this Letter, we report experimental findings based on the scan- ning tunneling spectroscopy studies of pure infinite-layer samples and those with a small concentration (1%) of ei- ther magnetic or nonmagnetic quantum impurities.A num- ber of surprising results are found and compared with the established phenomena in other cuprates."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The spectral weight of SLCO for quasiparticle energies at jEj $ D was smaller than the BCS prediction, whereas additional DOS appeared for jEj , D and the DOS ap- proached 0 at the Fermi level (i.e., V 0).  Such behavior cannot be accounted for by the simple inclusion of disorder in the BCS weak-coupling limit, because the latter would have only broadened the width of the conductance peaks and also increased the DOS near V 0 substantially. The spectra also differed fundamentally from those of pure d x 2 2y 2 -wave cuprates because of the lack of discernible gap variations and of the absence of ZBCP in all spectra taken on random grain orientations. Even in a special case of c-axis tunneling, jd 2 I\u035edV 2 j V!0 would have been a positive constant in a d x 2 2y 2 -wave superconductor, as simulated by the thin solid line in , which is in contrast to the finding of jd 2 I\u035edV 2 j V !0 6 0 in SLCO.

However, due to the lack of direct information for the Ni distribution on the sample surface, the true origin for two types of spectra in 1% Ni-SLCO remains uncertain. Considering the spectral difference between the major- ity spectrum of 1% Ni-SLCO and that of pure SLCO, as shown in , we find that the spectral characteris- tics resemble the findings in Ref. and are representa- tive of the impurity-induced state.  On the other hand, the slowly varying majority spectra of 1% Ni-SLCO, as shown in , were possibly the result of strong overlapping in the Ni-impurity wave functions and of weak screen- ing effects due to low carrier density in SLCO, which differed markedly from the rapidly diminishing impurity effects away from an isolated Mn or Gd atom on the surface of Nb , and also from the strong atomic-scale spectral variations near Ni impurities in the p-type cuprate Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca\u0351Cu 12x Ni x \u0352 2 O 81x. The contrast in the spa- tial extension of the Ni-impurity effects may be attributed to the variation in the impurity coupling strength and range, and also to the degree of impurity screening by carri- ers.

Looking in the general trend of electronic properties for pyrochlore oxides, many of 3d and 4d pyrochlore oxides are insulators owing to large electron correlation as well as relatively small electron transfer along the bent B-O-B bonds.  In contrast, 5d pyrochlore oxides often show a metallic conductivity due to direct overlap of 5d orbitals . A rare exception reported previously is found in Os 5+ pyrochlores like Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 , where a metal-insulator (MI) transition occurs at T = 226 K in the absence of structural anomalies. An Os 5+ ion has a 5d 3 electron configuration and thus the t 2g orbital is half-filled, suggesting a possible Mott-Hubbard type MI transition.  This example suggests that the effect of electron correlation is still important even for the 5d electron systems in the pyrochlore structure. It is intriguing to study how correlated electrons behave on the highly- frustrated pyrochlore lattice, but has not yet been explored intensively.It is to be noted that no superconductivity had been observed there so far in spite of many metallic compounds present in the family."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The A cations are eight- fold coordinated with six O and two O' anions and are located within distorted cubes, while the smaller B cations are six-fold coordinated and are located within distorted octahedra of which the six bond lengths from the central B cation to the corner O anion are equal. The corner-sharing BO 6 octahedra compose a three-dimensional network as shown in . The sublattice of B cations composes a three-dimensional corner- shared tetrahedral network, namely, the pyrochlore lattice as shown in . If the A cations are non-magnetic and the B cations are magnetic, the B-spin magnetic couplings are strongly frustrated under a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. For the case of localized electron spin moments, theoretical studies of the Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice have suggested that the ground state of such an insulator would be long-range magnetic order, spin-freezing, or quantum spin liquid.  The geometrical frustration plays a crucial role even in the case of itinerant electrons in the pyrochlore lattice.Indeed, the metallic spinel oxide LiV 2 O 4, which has a pyrochlore lattice of vanadium, has been reported to show heavy fermion behavior at low temperatures due to the geometrical frustration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Since neither ferromagnetic Ni nor rhombohedra Bi is superconducting in isolation, and furthermore the SC is found to be independent of the deposition order of Ni and Bi, it is natural to conceive that the SC is induced at the interface.Indeed, the direct experimental evidence comes from the RT curve of Bi(6 nm)/Ni(0.18 nm)/Cu(2 nm) as shown in Fig. , where 0.18 nm corresponds to one monolayer of Ni.While SC has not fully developed, the onset of SC (blue dots) is unmistaken.In contrast, Bi(20 nm)/Cu(2 nm) is non-superconducting (yellow dots)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We first fix the Bi film thickness at 15 nm and vary the Ni layer thickness to explore the influence of FM on the SC.  For a small increasing thickness of Ni, the SC is substantially suppressed. As shown in Fig. , for Ni layers between 2 -4 nm thick, the SC is systematically suppressed and completely destroyed with 4 nm Ni.  This result can be understood as a consequence of gradual penetration of the exchange interaction (effectively a strong magnetic field) from ferromagnetic Ni into the Bi film .Because of the finite size effect on the Curie temperature (equivalently the exchange field) of an ultrathin ferromagnetic film, the exchange field at the interface of Bi/Ni should be significantly stronger when a Ni film changes from 2 nm to 4 nm thick ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

However, as shown next, the thickness of the Bi layer plays a crucial role for the nucleation of the SC. In Fig. , we measured a series of Bi/Ni(4 nm) samples with a fixed Ni(4 nm) layer for which the SC has already been completely suppressed as shown in Fig. . As we increase the Bi layer from 15 nm, remarkably the SC reappears again with the same TC of 4 K.   Since the SC in the Bi(15 nm)/Ni(4 nm) is completely suppressed by the exchange field from the Ni layer, further increasing the Bi layer thickness cannot modify the interface or affect the Ni layer, the recurrence of the SC implies that the SC does not occur at the interface even though it may be triggered by the interface, which is again diametrically different from the S/F proximity effects. In fact the reappearance of the SC is a salient feature for the Ni/Bi superconducting systems.As seen in Fig. , when TC is plotted as a function of the Bi film thickness for several Ni film thicknesses, in each case there is always a similar sharp increase (within 5 nm) to saturation. For example, the SC for Ni(6 nm) reappears at about 30 nm of Bi, very far from the interface, and its TC reaches about 4 K at 35 nm of Bi.This result also excludes unambiguously the possibility that the SC in Bi/Ni comes from Bi-Ni alloy if any at the interface."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We believe that this unusual SC behavior in Bi/Ni must be related to the unique electronic property of Bi thin film. It has been realized that the interior of Bi thin films up to 90 nm is semiconducting (also confirmed here in this work by the yellow curve in Fig. ) then becomes semimetal for thicker films; meanwhile all the surfaces of Bi films including the top, bottom and side surfaces are always metallic , irrelevant to the orientations of the exposed surfaces .  It has also been known that, at 4 K, the thermal electronic excitation in the film interior appears already as the Bi film is thicker than 20 nm. Because of the well-known unusually long Fermi wavelength (~ 30 nm) and extremely long mean free path of electrons (up to mm) in Bi, as well as the extremely long decay of the inter- surface interaction in Bi films , the Cooper pairs could in principle be triggered via the interface in various channels but away from the interface, e.g., two electrons paired in the film interior or on the opposite surface to the interface, as shown schematically in Fig. .  In fact, this is distinctively different from any other superconducting systems where Cooper pairs always live at the place of the cause of interaction.These aspects suggest that the highly unusual SC in epitaxial Bi/Ni, differing from those of all known superconductors, may be topological in nature."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For a conventional superconductor such as Nb, the Andreev spectrum shows the well-known double-peak structure in the differential conductance (dI/dV), as shown by the inset of Fig. for a 100 nm Nb film measured with a gold tip at 4.2 K.  The peak position indicates the gap value of Nb and the change of dI/dV (the ratio of dI/dV at zero bias to that at large bias) must be less than 2, the Andreev limit . We have measured the Bi/Ni bilayer samples with and without a 2 nm gold protection layer using materials of zero spin polarization such as gold and highly spin-polarized materials such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO). We have measured over 100 contacts on these samples with contact resistance from a few \uf057 to over 1000 \uf057 for both LSMO and gold tips.  Surprisingly, there is only a single peak at zero bias. None of the Andreev spectra exhibit the double-peak feature as that of all conventional superconductors (e.g., Nb) and Fe pnictides.One representative Andreev spectra is shown in Fig. for a gold tip in contact on the sample Bi(20 nm)/Ni(2 nm)/MgO(100).  The change of the dI/dV peak can be much larger than the Andreev limit 2 and a highly spin-polarized current from the LSMO tip cannot suppress the peak, as shown in Fig. .  These results rule out conventional s-wave pairing.A possibility could be SC naturally compatible with magnetism, such as triplet p-wave pairing.Finally, it should be mentioned that the in-plane upper critical field Hc2 is beyond the Pauli limit (see Extended Data and Supplementary Information), which is consistent with foregoing AR results."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For both compounds the low temperature dependence of \u03bb ab was found to be lin- ear as expected for d-wave superconductivity. In fact normalised plots of [\u03bb ab (0) / \u03bb ab (T)] 2 versus T/T c were the same, and like YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO 7 ) 6 agreed very well with mean field (MF) theory for a weak coupling d-wave superconductor.However, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and tunneling data strongly suggest that for underdoped samples the superconducting gap, (\u2206 0 ), remains constant, or even in- creases slightly, while T c falls and so large deviations from MF theory might be expected. We have therefore ex- tended our investigation to deoxygenated (underdoped) pure YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 using the same ac susceptibility tech- nique to measure the penetration depth.  We report experimental results for the values and tem- perature dependences of \u03bb ab and \u03bb c of high quality c -axis grain-aligned orthorhombic 11 YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 (which has two CuO 2 planes per unit cell as well as Cu-O chains) with \u03b4 = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.43, and compare them with tetragonal Hg-1201 with one CuO 2 plane per unit cell and tetragonal Hg-1223 with three CuO 2 planes per unit cell. We find that the presence of the linear term in \u03bb ab (T) is independent of the number of CuO 2 planes per unit cell, carrier concentration, crystal structure, anisotropy and the presence of chains.Surprisingly our data show good agreement with weak coupling d-wave theory, and the linear term in [\u03bb ab (T) / \u03bb ab (0)] appears to scale with T /T c .This result highlights the need for detailed consideration of the relationship between super- conducting and normal state energy gaps in underdoped cuprates."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Electron probe micro- analysis and x-ray diffraction showed that all samples were single phase within an accuracy of \u2248 1%. The fully oxygenated, \u03b4 = 0.0 (YBCO 7 , T c = 92 K), samples were prepared by annealing bulk pieces in pure oxygen atmo- sphere at 380 o C for 24 hours and then slowly cooling to room temperature.  (Hereafter T c represents the temper- ature where the onset of superconductivity occurs in the ac susceptibility data for a measuring field H ac = 3 G rms and frequency f = 333 Hz.)  The \u03b4 = 0.3 (YBCO 6.7 , T c = 66 K) sample was prepared by annealing in pure oxygen atmosphere at 650 o C for 12 h and then quench- ing in liquid nitrogen, while the \u03b4 = 0.43 (YBCO 6.57 , T c = 56 K) sample was annealed in 0.2% O 2 / N 2 atmo- sphere at 550 o C for 12 hours and also quenched into liq- uid nitrogen.      The final oxygen contents were determined from the weight change of a fully oxygenated reference sample.The \u03b4 = 0.0 bulk piece was lightly ground and sedimented in acetone to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution. The sedimented powders were then heat treated to repair any structural damages to the surface of the grains.For \u03b4 = 0.3 and 0.43 on the other hand a bulk piece for each \u03b4 was lightly ground and sieved through a 20 \u00b5m sieve in an argon glove box to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution and to avoid surface degradation of the crystallites. The collected powders were then kept in argon atmosphere for 30 min before be- ing aligned.All powders, \u03b4 = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.43, were mag- netically aligned in epoxy as described earlier. The average grain diameters corresponding to the 50% cumu- lative volume point were 5 and 10 \u00b5m for the fully oxy- genated and the oxygen deficient samples, respectively.  The fraction of the unoriented powder in all grain aligned samples was estimated to be < 5 %.  Rocking curve anal- ysis of the \u03b4 = 0.0 and \u03b4 > 0.0 samples gave a full width at half maximum of \u00b1 1.4 and 1 o , respectively.  Low field susceptibility, \u03c7, measurements were performed us- ing commercial equipment (down to 4.2 K) for samples with \u03b4 = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.43. The sample with \u03b4 = 0.43 was also measured down to 1.2 K using a home built suscep- tometer.Details of the experimental technique and the application of London's model for deriving \u03bb from the measured \u03c7 in cuprate superconductors can be found in earlier publications. The values of \u03bb ab (0) derived from our data are 0.14, 0.21 and 0.28 \u00b5m and the corresponding values for \u03bb c (0) are 1.26, 4.53 and 7.17 \u00b5m for \u03b4 = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.43, respectively. The errors in \u03bb ab (0) arising from a pos- sible uncertainty of \u00b1 5% in the alignment can be as high as \u00b1 25%, whereas those in \u03bb c (0) are \u00b1 8%.How- ever, the corresponding uncertainty in the linear term in [\u03bb ab (T)/\u03bb ab (0)] is much less, at most \u00b1 10%.The present results differ from previous work in which the surfaces of the particles were probably not as clean and the degree of grain alignment was probably lower.As T c is reduced by lowering the carrier concentration (for \u03b4 = 0.3 and 0.43), [1 / \u03bb ab 2 (0)] falls, a behaviour which has been ex- tensively discussed in terms of the Uemura relation.The ratio \u03b3 = [\u03bb c (0) / \u03bb ab (0)] i.e. the anisotropy, in- creases with oxygen deficiency."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

It is clear that the linear term in 1-[\u03bb ab (0) / \u03bb ab (T )] 2 increases as T c decreases. If we use the standard BCS result for \u03bb(T ) of a d-wave superconductor, 28 to fit the experimental data shown in Fig. (at T / T c < 0.25) we find that \u2206 0 scales approximately with T c [Fig. (inset)], giving \u2206 0 \u2248 2T c , a value close to that ex- pected for weak-coupling superconductivity.  For com- parison we also include data for the s-wave perovskite Ba 0.6 K 0.4 BiO 3 (BKBO). The compounds Bi-2212 and Tl-2201 25 would also give \u2206 0 \u2248 2T c on this plot. The maximum error in the linear terms i.e. the values of \u2206 0 in Fig. (inset), is \u00b1 20 %.  The scaling of \u2206 0 with T c , Fig. (inset), is in agreement with early tunneling spectroscopy data for several cuprates as a function of carrier concentration, ranging from the underdoped to the optimally doped regimes. It is not consistent however, with more recent tunneling 8 and ARPES 7 results for underdoped cuprates where \u2206 0 was actually found to increase slightly while T c falls.There seems to be two possible ways of ac- counting this discrepancy.    One is that the recent spectro- scopic experiments actually measure the normal state gap. In this scenario the effect of the normal state gap would be to leave small pockets of holes whose supercon- ducting properties are still described reasonably well by MF theory.The other is similar to a recent phenomeno- logical approach. As shown in Fig. , it is probable, that within experimental error, the unnormalised plots of [1/\u03bb ab (T ) 2 ], i.e. n s (T), versus T at low temperatures are parallel for samples with different T c values. This would correspond to the same number of excited quasiparticles, [n s (0) -n s (T)], at a given temperature for all T c values- as implied by specific heat work on underdoped YBCO.

This silver oxide exhibits metallic conductiv- ity. Band calculation by Brennan and Burdett shows that its conductivity mainly comes from Ag5s orbital, and that its Fermi surface has a quasi-three-dimensional character because both the silver chain and Kagome lat- tice contribute to the density of states at the Fermi level. Interestingly, the resistivity behaves as \u03c1 = AT 2 + \u03c1 0 in an unusually wide range of temperature, down to below 4 K and up to room temperature .  This means that unknown strong scattering mechanism dominates over the usual electron-phonon scattering. Superconductiv- ity of Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6 was recently suggested by the present authors . We reported quite a large diamagnetic sig- nal in the AC susceptibility measured using a cluster of single crystals below 48 mK but could not obtain zero resistivity at that time.

All the mea- surements reported here were performed with a 4 He-3 He dilution refrigerator (Cryoconcept, Model DR-JT-S-100-10), covering the measurement temperatures as low as 16 mK. The resistivity was measured using a conven- tional four-probe method with an AC current of 10.4 \u00b5A rms at 163 Hz with a hexagonal-stick single crystal which fits in 0.14 \u00d7 0.21 \u00d7 1.15 mm 3 .  We used pure gallium to attach electrical wires of copper to the sample crystals. We note here that one must keep the temperature of the electrodes well below the melting point of gallium (29 \u2022 C) all the time after soldering in order to avoid the electri- cal contacts getting worse. We avoided using gold wires because gallium easily dissolves gold. The AC suscepti- bility was measured by a mutual inductance method. We fabricated a very small and highly-sensitive cell by wind- ing a 50-\u00b5m-diameter copper wire on a 0.5-mm-diameter polyimide tube (The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., PIT-S). The excitation field H AC was 8.7 mOe rms at 887 Hz, which is much lower than the H c of Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6.  To re- duce the influences of remnant magnetic fields such as the earth's field and the residual field in the equipment, these measurements were performed in a magnetic shield.We used a cylinder of permalloy (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., E989-28), which has an extremely high permeabil- ity. Inside the permalloy tube, we also placed a lead cylinder with a closed bottom, to expel the remaining magnetic flux. The DC magnetic field for the measure- ments was applied with a small solenoidal coil of Nb-Ti superconducting wire placed inside the shield. The mag- nitude of the DC field H DC is numerically calculated by taking into account the shielding current on lead shield's surface ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

One is the fact that a large supercooling is observed at the superconduct- ing transition under magnetic fields while no supercooling is seen in zero field. This means that the superconduct- ing transition becomes first order only when an external field is applied.  Such behavior is only seen in type-I su- perconductors. The other is the very large positive peaks of \u03c7 \u2032 AC just before the superconducting to normal tran- sitions. These peaks are ascribable to the \"differential paramagnetic effect\" (DPE) , which represents that the field derivative of the magnetization \u2202M/\u2202H is positive near the transition and also the magnetic process in this region is reversible. In a type-I superconductor with a fi- nite size, the intermediate state takes place and the DPE should be observed. On the other hand, type-II supercon- ductors should show no or rather small DPE because of the irreversibity of magnetic process due to flux pinning.

Here we identify the transition fields of the superconducting to normal transition as critical fields H c . This should be valid despite the possibility of superheating, because the observed DPE shows that Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6 is in the intermedi- ate state, in which superconducting and normal states coexist, and there should be no superheating at the \"transition\" from the intermediate state to the normal state. We also define the normal to superconducting transition fields as supercooling fields H sc . This tran- sition should be from the normal to the full Meissner states since we observed no DPE. We can fit a relation H c (T ) = H c0 [1 \u2212 (T /T c0 ) \u03b1 ] to all the H c data down to 16 mK using H c0 and \u03b1 as fitting parameters, while T c0 = 52.4 mK is determined from the temperature sweep data in zero field. As a result, we obtained H c0 = 2.19 Oe and \u03b1 = 1.56. The data can also be fitted by a conven- tional relation with \u03b1 = 2: . However, the fitting is successful only down to T /T c = 0.7 and the resulting parameter is H * c0 = 1.80 Oe. Now we can evaluate some of the superconducting pa- rameters from these results.

The AC susceptibility reveals that Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6 is an oxide type-I superconductor.It is widely considered that type-I superconductivity is rare in compounds, although there is no fundamental reason to prohibit it.   The present discov- ery indeed demonstrates that even an oxide can be an ex- treme type-I superconductor. Superconducting parame- ters indicate that Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6 is a dirty-limit type-I super- conductor and thus the pairing symmetry of Ag 5 Pb 2 O 6 should be isotropic.The discovery of this novel class of superconductor, silver oxide superconductor with a lay- ered structure, should motivate searches for more super- conductors among similar silver oxides.A salient next target is to adjust the doping to realize the electronic states with strong electron correlations, closely analogous to that of the high-T c cuprates, in order to seek for un- conventional superconductivity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The Ca-intercalated graphite, CaC 6 , with its \"record\" T c of about 11.5 K, in particular, has been the subject of various theoretical and experimental in- vestigations in the past two years (for a short review of the initial results see ).One of the most important questions, however, is still not clear: what is the mag- nitude and anisotropy of its superconducting gap? The first experiments (STM, penetration depth, specific heat) on CaC 6 have evidenced a single, apparently isotropic, s- wave gap with a ratio 2\u2206/k B T c of the order of the BCS value .   Recent tunnel spectroscopy results, on the other hand, claimed the presence of an isotropic gap with a magnitude more than 40% higher than that reported earlier .  The spread of gap values measured up to now range between 1.6 meV and 2.3 meV . The im- portant point is that all these experiments have either probed a bulk property or a directional one along the c-axis direction .As pointed out in Ref., the presence of anisotropic or two-gap superconductivity in CaC 6 cannot be ruled out until tunneling or point- contact measurements are performed also along the ab direction.On the other hand, recent first-principles den- sity functional calculations of the superconducting prop- erties of CaC 6 have supported the presence of a moder- ately anisotropic gap which varies between 1.1 and 2.3 meV, depending on the k-point and the \u03c0 or interlayer (IL) sheet of the Fermi surface (FS) involved .Such an anisotropy can be revealed by directional spectroscopy measurements performed along both c and ab direction."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For this reason, in all the contacts, we therefore carefully studied the temperature dependence of the conductance in order to determine the critical temperature of the junction, i.e. the 'Andreev critical temperature', T A c . In an overall of 35 different contacts, T A c was found to be 11.3 \u00b1 0.1 K, in best agreement with the bulk T c 's of the samples and in contrast with a previous report .

(1) are shown at T = 0 K and for a-and c-axis directions (top curves in ). The conductance calcu- lated along the b direction is almost identical to the one in a direction. At T = 0 the topology of the CaC 6 FS and the calculated anisotropy of the \u03c0 and IL gaps re- sult in a sizeable anisotropy of the AR conductance. In ab direction, it exhibits a sharp peak (related to the \u03c0 gap) at about 1.38 meV and a broad shoulder (mainly related to the IL gap) at about 1.9 meV. In c direction, as expected from the shape of the FS, the role of the IL (Ca) gap becomes more important and the conductance shows two distinct peaks with almost the same height. However, for \u0393 = 0 even at T = 0 K these anisotropic features are rapidly smeared out. The middle curves of show the effect on the theoretical con- ductances of a broadening similar to that observed at very low T in the experimental curves of . The con- ductances become similar to single-gap ones and can be perfectly fitted by single-gap 3D BTK curves, as shown in . The use of more complex fitting models (anisotropic or two-band BTK) that we tested on our data does not improve the fit substantially, as already pointed out in Ref. In the ex- perimental ab-plane and c-axis conductances measured at 400 mK are included too (circles) in order to show the remarkable agreement with the theoretical curves for the same level of broadening. Although this broadening washes out the fine anisotropic structures of the conduc- tance, a clear sign of the underlying gap anisotropy is still present since the 3D BTK fit of the theoretical con- ductances gives different order parameters in the two di- rections, \u2206 = 1.5 meV (\u0393 = 0.65 meV, Z = 0.765) for a-axis direction and \u2206 = 1.7 meV (\u0393 = 0.92 meV, Z = 1.015) for c-axis one. The c-axis value is in perfect agree- ment with the experimental results (both single curves at 400 mK and the peak of the distribution of the 14 dif- ferent contacts). In the ab-plane case, the experimental \u2206 values from the curves at 400 mK and from the peak of the distribution of (a) (ranging from 1.3 meV to 1.44 meV) are smaller than the value obtained from the fit of the theoretical conductance. This discrepancy could be ascribed to a possible slight overestimation of the small \u03c0 gap (and, maybe, an underestimation of the large IL gap associated with Ca FS) in the theoretical calculations. This fact appears reasonable if one consid- ers that the first-principle calculations of Ref. led to an underestimation of T c of about 17 %."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In particular the marginal Fermi-liquid (MFL) , and Lut- tinger liquid approaches along with the conventional strong electron-phonon interaction have been put forward to account for these unusual properties.

The temperature dependence of the low-frequency conductivity is consistent with the dc resistivity measured on crystals of the same batch. Based on the f-sum rule we argue that phonon-contributions are too weak to account for this maximum. We discuss a scenario, where the unusual temperature dependence is due to intra-and interband transitions within and between electronic bands near E F of CuO 2 and BiO character. Bi 2 Sr 2 Cu0 6 single crystals were grown from a precursor dissolved in liquid KCl.  Due to the formation of an enclosed cavity of a few cm 3 within the melt samples were obtained as free standing crystalline platelets of sizes up to 1-2\u00d71-2 mm 2 and of thickness 5-20 \u00b5m. A constant cavity temperature of 840-850 \u2022 C and a constant temperature gradient (2-3 K/cm) were kept within the melt in order to provide permanent transport of the precursor to the growth zone, which is important for a free growth of homogeneous crystals with a flat mirror surface. Such samples require no mechanical or chemical polishing prior to the infrared reflectivity measurements. X-ray measurements revealed a perfect crystal structure with lattice parameters a = 5.36\u00c5 b =5.37\u00c5 and c = 24.64\u00c5, which correspond to the orthorhombic \u221a 2 \u00d7 \u221a 2 distortion of the body centered tetragonal structure. No traces of other phases could be detected. The rocking curves have a full width at half maximum of 0.1 \u2022 , 7 which is the minimum value so far reported. Both from the resistivity and the ac- susceptibility we obtained the same values for the superconducting transition temperature (T c =7-8 K) and for the transition width (\u2206T c =2 K). Unlike earlier reports where a linear resistivity was observed down to the superconducting phase transition , in the present crystals \u03c1(T ) is only linear at high temperatures but saturates below 40 K 10 at a residual resistivity with a sample to sample variation from 150 to 300 \u00b5\u2126cm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

At 10 K the free-electron response is prevalent in the low frequency conductivity. In the remainder of this paper we will in- dicate the depression of the conductivity below the maximum as a pseudo-gap. In the present case there is no unambiguous -and physically meaningful-way to decompose the conductivity in free-carrier and bound-charge components. One of the reasons is, that in the high T c cuprates also the intraband conductivity deviates considerably from standard Drude behavior. In particular the high T c cuprates, if optimally doped, are known to have a linear frequency dependency of the scattering rate, as follows from inversion of the real and imaginary part of \u03c3(\u03c9) using the expression 14 \u03c3(\u03c9) = ne 2 m \u22121 / {\u03b3(\u03c9) \u2212 i\u03c9m \u22c6 (\u03c9)/m}, where n is the carrier density, m is the band mass, m \u22c6 (\u03c9)/m is the effective mass enhancement, and 1/\u03b3(\u03c9) is the effective relaxation time.  A further complication arises, if two or more electronic bands cross the Fermi level. In this case, which we believe to be relevant for Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6 , the spectrum of \u03c3(\u03c9) contains interband transitions in addition to the intra- band components. The interband part has a complex line-shape which depends on the details of the band-dispersion and the k-dependent optical transition matrix elements. Obviously if the material has two or more bands of electrons, at least one of which (the CuO 2 bands) has a frequency dependent scattering rate, it is no longer possible to make a meaningful sepa- ration in several components. At low temperatures, where the CuO 2 channel has a reduced scattering rate, \u03c3(\u03c9) is dominated by the CuO 2 channel at least at the low frequencies. In this region one might hope to extract the frequency dependent scattering rate of the CuO 2 carriers, at least up to a frequency where other contributions to \u03c3(\u03c9) become significant. For this reason we display in the inset of Fig. the frequency dependent scattering rate only for the lowest temperature. We notice that the linear behavior of \u03b3(\u03c9), which is rather typical for all high T c cuprates, exists only up to 0.1 eV in this case.  In view of the possibility of low energy interband transitions in this compound, even at 10 K \u03b3(\u03c9) extracted from optical data is probably no longer meaningful forh\u03c9 > 0.1 eV.Our observations support the conclusion by Romero et al, based on an analysis of infrared transmission data, that the linear frequency dependency of \u03b3(\u03c9) is limited to the energy range below 0.1 eV. The non-linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in the crystals used for this study is also inconsistent with MFL behavior at the lowest temperatures."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The pseudo-gap at high temperatures would be due to transitions between the closely spaced bands which cross E F near M . In this scenario the disappearance of the pseudo-gap at low temperatures can reflect a gradual change of atomic coordinates upon cooling, with a corresponding change of the interband separation. This structural modulation can easily result in a re-distribution of carriers between BiO and CuO 2 bands and the disappearance of the pseudo-gap. Interestingly, large lattice distortions are generally present in films, which show a higher T c and a more pronounced pseudo-gap.  We have presented experimental data on the in-plane infrared response of superconduct- ing Bi2201 single crystals for temperatures from 10 K to 300 K. The optical conductivity shows a pseudo-gap feature, that shifts with temperature. The optical conductivity is at least one order of magnitude too large to be compatible with a purely phononic interpre- tation of this feature. This observation indicates the presence of two coupled conducting channels and may provide important clues regarding the fact that T c in the single layer Bi- cuprate material is much lower than in other nearly stoichiometric compounds.

Indeed, supporting evidence for a FL ground state has only sur- faced very recently with the experimental verification of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in OD Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+\u03b4 (Tl2201) (T c \u223c 15K) .   By suppressing superconduc- tivity in a large magnetic field, Proust et al. observed the precise WF ratio \u03ba ab /\u03c3 ab T = L 0 , where \u03ba ab and \u03c3 ab are the in-plane thermal and electrical conductivities and the Lorenz number L 0 = 2.44 \u00d7 10 \u22128 W\u2126/K \u22122 .Sur- prisingly however, and at odds with a conventional FL picture, the WF relation was found to co-exist with a large linear resistivity term extending down to 0K.  This dichotomy raises the question whether the field-induced 'normal state' in OD HTC, i.e. beyond H c2 , is the same as the ground state that would exist in the absence of a magnetic field, as it does in more conventional super- conductors.Moreover, a clear understanding of the ex- perimental situation in OD cuprates has often been com-pounded by their tendency to undergo phase separation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

(A slight downturn is also observed for A2 below 0.1K, though nowhere near as dra-matic.) While slight deviations from the WF law can be attributed to additional anisotropy in \u03ba ph not yet ac- counted for, there is no assumption on \u03ba ph (T ) which can erase the sudden vanishing of \u03ba el below 0.2K for A1. Note that this downturn is robust both to changes in the ther- mal contacts and the crystal dimensions. Intriguingly, a vanishing of \u03ba el has also been observed in the electron- doped cuprate Pr 2\u2212x Ce x CuO 4 (PCCO) . By suppress- ing superconductivity with a high magnetic field, Hill et al. found that \u03ba el /T , whilst violating the WF law for T > 0.3K (in the sense that it clearly exceeds L 0 /\u03c1(T ), rapidly vanishes as T falls below 0.3K.  These two anoma- lous observations appear to have a common origin. The sample-dependent aspect of the downturn, however, sug- gests that it may be extrinsic in origin and unrelated to any exotic electronic behavior, particularly in view of the other, more conventional results obtained here for La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 above 0.2K.

This observation reveals a new aspect of the physics of the cuprates and is the central result of this Letter.  Whilst various explanations for the magni- tude of the KW ratio in heavy fermion systems have been proposed, including a strong frequency dependence of the quasi-particle self-energy and proximity to an anti- ferromagnetic instability , none have so far predicted deviations from a 0 as large as those found in the HTC. It is noted, however, that the effect of a strong momen- tum dependence in the scattering amplitude, thought to be a key feature of HTC , has yet to be taken into account and efforts to include such an effect could prove highly illuminating. As one moves across the HTC phase diagram towards the Mott insulator at half-filling, one expects e-e scat- tering to become even more intense. Thus, the grad- ual evolution from quadratic to linear resistivity in HTC must somehow reflect the growing strength of e-e inter- actions as one approaches the Mott insulator from the metallic side. As an indication of how rapidly the e-e scattering intensity might grow, we note here that \u03c1 ab of La 1.85 Sr 0.15 CuO 4 is \u2248 2 -3 times larger than that of La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 at 300K, even though the Luttinger sum rule dictates that their carrier densities differ by only a few percent.  Moreover, given the relatively minor changes observed in the phonon spectra as a function of doping, one does not expect the strength of the e-ph in- teraction to change forcibly across the phase diagram. Thus, since e-ph scattering appears to give a negligi- ble contribution to \u03c1 ab (T ) in La 1.7 Sr 0.3 CuO 4 , it seems highly unlikely now that e-ph scattering can in any way account for the linear resistivity that appears (in a nar- row composition range) around optimal doping.In the light of these results, we conclude that chronic (Umk- lapp) e-e scattering processes must dominate the normal state transport behavior of the cuprates across the entire accessible doping range.Such a scenario is consistent with the large increase in the quasi-particle lifetime be- low T c observed in thermal and electrical conductivity measurements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Unresolved issues remain concern- ing the normal-state temperature dependence and the superconducting-state enhancement. Because of the low carrier density, heat conduction by the lattice accounts for more than half of the measured normal-state \u03ba ab in these materials. One would expect \u03ba ab (T ) in high-quality crystals to reflect a dominant lattice contribution simi- lar to that of crystalline insulators, i.e. \u03ba ab \u223c 1/T at high-T , rising sharply to a maximum at low T . This be- havior is observed in Nd 2\u2212x Ce x CuO 4 (Nd-214), but for all other cuprates investigated \u03ba ab is very weakly T de- pendent for T > T c .  Whereas for Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCuO 8 struc- tural disorder (e.g., the Bi-O layer modulation ) might explain its nearly glass-like lattice contribution, this would not seem applicable to YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+x (Y-123) and La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 (La-214). Furthermore, \u03ba ab (T ) for un- doped, insulating Y-123 and La-214 is unconventional, suggesting that the weak T -dependence of \u03ba ab is generic to the latter materials and not directly related to the presence of free charge.   An unidentified phonon damping mechanism appears to underlie this behavior, possibly due to local lattice distortions and/or mag- netic excitations.Regarding the enhancement, 4,7 ther- mal Hall conductivity experiments 8 on optimally-doped Y-123 imply that the phenomenon is largely electronic in origin, but less is known about underdoped compounds.The magnitude of the enhancement correlates with the superconducting pair density 9,10 in Y-123 throughout the underdoped regime, and it is of interest to explore the generality of this behavior through studies of other cuprates."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Accordingly, the lattice volume is decreased by the negative chemical pressure.This fact implies that the reduction of the lattice volume by applying physical pressure would further enhance T c . This expectation was confirmed actually in previous two high-pressure (HP) experiments by measuring magnetization up to 1.2 GPa for all the members [11] and up to 0.8 GPa for RbOs 2 O 6 [7].  Another interesting finding in the former study is that only in the case of KOs 2 O 6 the T c exhibits a saturation around 0.6 GPa and then decreases slightly with pressure, suggesting complicated pressure dependences at higher pressures.  Thus, it is important to investigate the pressure dependence of T c and other properties in a wider pressure range. It is also intriguing to search for another ground state which would exist next to the superconducting state under very high pressure, as often found in other unconventional superconductors [12].In this Letter, we report on resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 10 GPa on all the three members of the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxide superconductors.A characteristic pressure-temperature phase diagram has been obtained, where in general the T c exhibits a dome-shaped change as a function of pressure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For CsOs 2 O 6 and RbOs 2 O 6 , they were nearly single-phase including a small amount of Os metal.  For KOs 2 O 6 , 10 mol% of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 was contained as another phase, which was necessary to obtain a sufficiently hard pellet for resistivity measurements. The coexistence of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 may not affect the determination of T c , because it becomes insulating below 230 K .    Electrical resistivity measurements were performed by the four-probe method in a cubic-anvil press apparatus [14] at high pressures from 2 GPa to 10 GPa and temperatures from 3 K to 300 K.A fluorinert liquid, which is a one-to-one mixture of FC-70 and FC-77 (3M TM ), was used as a pressure transmitting medium. A polycrystalline pellet of a typical size of 0.8 \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 0.4 mm 3 was immersed into the fluorinert liquid in a cylindrical teflon capsule of 1.5 \u03c6 \u00d7 1.8 mm 3 size.Then, the capsule was put into a cubic pyrophillite block of 6.0 mm edge and compressed almost isostatically by using six anvils made of tungsten carbide.  The whole of the sample cell and the press was placed in a liquid-helium dewar to cool down to 3 K.  Each run of resistivity T 2 , as shown in the inset to Fig.3(a) for RbOs 2 O 6 , to determine A and \u03c1 0 . The slope of the T 2 term in RbOs 2 O 6 is large at 2 GPa and does not change much up to 3 GPa near the T c maximum.Then it decreases very much from 4 GPa to 7 GPa, where T c decreases and finally disappears, and then increases again at 8 GPa and 10 GPa. The origin of an upturn observed at low temperatures above 7 GPa is not known and it is ignored in evaluating A and \u03c1 0 .  Such an upturn was not detected in our recent experiment using a better quality of sample.   The same analysis has been carried out for CsOs 2 O 6 .   The resulting pressure dependences of A and \u03c1 0 are summarized in Fig. 4.  In order to deduce a general trend, each quantity has been normalized by the value at the maximum of the T c dome. Pressure is also normalized as P n = ( P -P* ) / ( P c -P* ), where P* is a pressure at the T c maximum and P c is a critical pressure where superconductivity disappears; that is, P n = 0 for P = P* and P n = 1 for P = P c .For KOs 2 O 6 , only T c is plotted, because we could not obtain reliable data due to the presence of impurities. It becomes apparent now that normalized T c falls on a universal curve. Either normalized A and \u03c1 0 is connected smoothly between RbOs 2 O 6 and CsOs 2 O 6 to show a general curve: Normalized A exhibits a broad maximum near the T c maximum and a minimum near P c , while normalized \u03c1 0 shows a minimum near P* and a maximum near P c . In the framework of Fermi liquid theory, A is proportional to square of effective mass of carriers or density of states at the Fermi level.Thus, the above results on A imply that the carrier mass is enhanced significantly at the T c maximum owing to correlation effects. This strongly suggests that the mechanism of superconductivity in the \u03b2-pyrochlore 4 oxides is relevant to electron correlations. On the other hand, residual resistivity is generally expressed by the equation \u03c1 0 = ( \u0127 / e 2 l ) ( 3 \u03c0 2 ) 1/3 n -2/3 , where l is the mean free path of carriers and n is carrier density. The mean free path at low temperature may be determined by the concentration of impurities or defects and thus should not be affected by pressure.  It is expected, however, that the mean free path would be reduced largely by quantum fluctuations developing toward absolute zero, which often exist near a quantum critical point associated with a certain long-range order such as a magnetic transition or valence transition [16,17].   The observed enhancement in \u03c1 0 near P c may indicate that there is an unknown long-range order at higher pressure. Possibly, the sudden recovery of metallic behavior observed below 100 K at 10 GPa in RbOs 2 O 6 (Fig.3(b) is related to this long range order.   It is plausible that the associated quantum fluctuations would suppress the superconductivity, giving rise to a dome-shaped T c variation.  The observed dome-shaped change in T c and the corresponding unusual variations in A and \u03c1 0 must reflect unconventional features of superconductivity in the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxides. However, it seems that they are quite different from those observed in well-known unconventional superconductors, such as f-electron intermetallic compounds or low-dimensional organic conductors [12,18]. A typical f-electron compound CeCu 2 Ge 2 exhibits a large reduction in A and a sharp peak in \u03c1 0 at the T c maximum, which is believed to be induced by valence fluctuations [12,16,17]. In the present \u03b2-pyrochlores osmium ions are formally in a 5.5 valent state with two and a half 5d electrons.It is interesting to note that this number of 5d electrons is just between two integer values for Re 5+ ions (5d 2 ) in 1 K superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 and Os 5+ ions (5d 3 ) in Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 exhibiting a metal-to-insulator transition [13, 19].However, we think that valence fluctuations may not play a primary role in the \u03b2-pyrochlores, because the band width of Os 5d -O 2p hybridized bands is large, ~3 eV, from the band structure calculations [20-22].The most plausible scenario for quantum fluctuations is to assume electronic instability associated with Fermi surface nesting.Harima has pointed out that an important general feature on the band structure of the \u03b2-pyrochlores is the existence of a pair of Fermi surfaces of nearly octahedral shape which forms a thin shell centered at the \u0393 point.Thus, strong Fermi surface nesting and resulting spin-density-wave instability are expected.Moreover, a 'dimple' grows on the octahedral Fermi surface from K to Cs, suggesting that the nesting becomes weaker along this line.It would be interesting to test how this feature changes under high pressure.In order to clarify the existence of possible quantum fluctuations in the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxides and their relevance to the superconductivity, further experiments are required under high pressures.In summary, we have obtained interesting and characteristic behavior in the pressure dependence of T c and other parameters in the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxides AOs 2 O 6 by measuring resistivity under high pressure up to 10 GPa.Generally, the T c shows a dome-like shape as a function of pressure.The variations of the coefficient A of the T 2 term and the residual resistivity \u03c1 0 are also anomalous and synchronized with the change in T c .These results suggest that electron correlations enhance the superconductivity, while certain quantum fluctuations give rise to the degradation of T c at higher pressure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The room temperature resistivity becomes now almost independent of pressure, while the residual resistivity is further increased enormously.As a result, the resistivity at 7 GPa becomes almost temperature independent.  Applying further pressure, the overall resistivity shifts upward uniformly at 8 GPa, and surprisingly at 10 GPa the resistivity starts to decrease steeply below 100 K, implying that metallic behavior is recovered.  However, it is to be noted that this temperature dependence of resistivity is apparently different from that at low pressure in the superconducting regime.Very recently, we carried out another HP experiments on a different sample of RbOs 2 O 6 with better purity and larger residual resistivity ratio and obtained essentially the same results, indicating that the above changes are intrinsic and reproducible.We found substantially the same behavior in resistivity under HP for CsOs 2 O 6 and KOs 2 O 6 , except for differences in the pressure range."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In the framework of Fermi liquid theory, A is proportional to square of effective mass of carriers or density of states at the Fermi level.

However, it seems that they are quite different from those observed in well-known unconventional superconductors, such as f-electron intermetallic compounds or low-dimensional organic conductors . A typical f-electron compound CeCu 2 Ge 2 exhibits a large reduction in A and a sharp peak in \u03c1 0 at the T c maximum, which is believed to be induced by valence fluctuations .  In the present \u03b2-pyrochlores osmium ions are formally in a 5.5 valent state with two and a half 5d electrons.It is interesting to note that this number of 5d electrons is just between two integer values for Re 5+ ions (5d 2 ) in 1 K superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 and Os 5+ ions (5d 3 ) in Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 exhibiting a metal-to-insulator transition . However, we think that valence fluctuations may not play a primary role in the \u03b2-pyrochlores, because the band width of Os 5d -O 2p hybridized bands is large, ~3 eV, from the band structure calculations .   The most plausible scenario for quantum fluctuations is to assume electronic instability associated with Fermi surface nesting. Harima has pointed out that an important general feature on the band structure of the \u03b2-pyrochlores is the existence of a pair of Fermi surfaces of nearly octahedral shape which forms a thin shell centered at the \u0393 point.Thus, strong Fermi surface nesting and resulting spin-density-wave instability are expected. Moreover, a 'dimple' grows on the octahedral Fermi surface from K to Cs, suggesting that the nesting becomes weaker along this line. It would be interesting to test how this feature changes under high pressure.In order to clarify the existence of possible quantum fluctuations in the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxides and their relevance to the superconductivity, further experiments are required under high pressures."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Much attention has been devoted to the newly developed superconductors with Fe-square lattices. In 2009, a family of superconducting layered iron pnictides was reported; Ae 2 MFePnO 3 (the so-called 21113 systems) with a perovskite-type layered local structure of Ae 2 MO 3 , where Ae denotes an alkaline-earth metal, M denotes Sc, Ti, Cr, V or another transition metals, and Pn denotes P or As.  The onset temperatures of the superconducting transition (T c onset ) of the nominally synthesized Sr 2 ScFePO 3 and Sr 2 VFeAsO 3 are 17 K (6) and 37.2 K , respectively.On the other hand, Sr 2 ScFeAsO 3 , Sr 2 CrFeAsO 3 , Ba 2 ScFeAsO 3 , and the Ca-Sc-Fe-As-O system have been reported to not exhibit a superconducting phase; however, when Sc 3+ or Cr was substituted with Ti 4+ , these compounds exhibit superconductivity with T c onset = 45 K, 29.2 K, and 37 K .  Other superconducting materials have been reported for the 21113 systems; i.e. Sr 2 (Mg, Ti)FeAsO 3 with T c onset = 33-39 K (14), Ca 2 AlFePO 3-y with T c onset = 17.1 K, and Ca 2 AlFeAsO 3-y with T c onset = 28.3 K.Furthermore, Sr 3 Sc 2 Fe 2 As 2 O 5 (16, 17) (a member of the so-called 32225 systems) and the homologous series of Ca n+1 (Sc, Ti) n Fe 2 As 2 O y (n = 3, 4, 5; y ~ 3n-1) (18) and Ca n+2 (Al, Ti) n Fe 2 As 2 O y (n = 2, 3, 4; y = 3n) were reported as compounds with thicker perovskite-related blocking layers compared to those of the 21113 systems."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The large \uf06d 0 H c2 is suitable for applications involving high magnetic fields. As shown in Fig. , the crystal structure of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 is described as a tetragonal lattice with FeAs carrier conducting layers sandwiched by Sr 2 VO 3\u2212\u03b4 perovskite-related carrier-blocking layers.  Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 , which has been reported with nominal chemical compositions, shows superconducting transitons at T c onset \u2264 37.2 K under ambient pressure and at T c onset = 46.0 K (21) under high pressure.

Furthermore, Tegel et al. reported that 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum of Sr 2 CrFeAsO 3 shows substantial broadening at 4.2 K, which could be fitted to various internal magnetic fields. The 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of Sr 2 MFeAsO 3 (M = Sc, Cr) suggest that a magnetic phase of the Fe sublattice in Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 are still controversial .Therefore, constructing magnetic and electronic phase diagrams of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 requires systematic study of its chemical compositions and element-specific magnetic measurements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of other samples are summarized in the supplementary information (Fig. S8). The 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectra are composed of quadrupole doublet absorption lines at 300 K for each sample, indicating the paramagnetic (PM) phase of the Fe sublattice.  Asymmetry doublet absorption lines of the samples are derived from the anisotropy of crystal orientation (44) for Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 . 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the \u03b4 = 0.232 sample were fitted to a doublet pattern at 2.5 \u2264 T \u2264 300 K without an internal magnetic field (B int ), indicating the PM Fe in the \u03b4 = 0.232 sample.  The \u03b4 = 0.124, 0.232, and 0.237 samples also exhibit the PM Fe at T \uf0b3 4.2 K. (See Fig. S6) The 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the \u03b4 = 0.267 and 0.509 samples were fitted to a doublet pattern from 30 to 300 K.The absorption lines became broader at T~10 K, indicating that spontaneous magnetic moments appear in the Fe-sublattice.    The broad absorption lines are clearly different from a sextet split spectrum showing the antiferromagnetically ordered Fe sublattice which is typically observed for mother compounds of iron-based superconductors; LaFeAsO and BaFe 2 As 2 . As shown in Fig. , the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the \u03b4 = 0.267, 0.509, 0.631 samples substantially increase at T < 20 K.The increasing FWHM indicates finite distribution of B int in these samples. The broad absorption lines also indicate that both of magnetic Fe and nonmagnetic Fe appear in a same chemical composition.  Given the wide distribution of B int , the broad absorption lines can be fitted sufficiently well enough to quantify mean values of the B int .  In the present study, Hesse and R\u00fcbertsch's method was applied to obtain the distribution of B int .  Figure shows temperature dependence of the isomer shift (IS), quadrupole splitting (QS), and FWHM for the \u03b4 = 0.124, 0.232, 0.237, 0.267, 0.509, and 0.631 samples.As shown in Fig. 8a, the IS value of the superconducting \u03b4 = 0.124 sample is the smaller than those of the normal conducting \u03b4 = 0.232, 0.237, 0.267, 0.509 and 0.631 samples at RT. The smaller IS value of the \u03b4 = 0.124 sample indicates higher s-electron densities around the nucleus compared to the other samples. In terms of the Debye approximation of the lattice vibrations, Debye temperatures were obtained at 454(29) K for the \u03b4 = 0.232 sample and 362(12) K for the \u03b4 = 0.509 sample from IS-T curves.The increase of \u03b4 correlates with elastic properties of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 . The upper inset of Fig. 8a indicates that the IS-T curve of \u03b4 = 0.509 sample shows an anomalous decreasing at T < 20 K with decreasing T.In general, IS for a sample, which does not show a phase transition, increases and saturates at low temperatures alike theoretical curves drawn in the upper inset of Fig. 8a.The anomalous decreasing IS indicates that there is a phase transition at T < 20 K for \u03b4 = 0.509 sample.Indeed, several samples also show a kink in QS-T curves and a sudden increasing of FWHM-T curves, indicating an appearance of anisotropic electric field gradients and AFM phases of the Fe sublattice."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The lowest energy of (c-AF on V, s-AF on Fe) is lower than those of (A-AF on V, s-AF on Fe) by 4 meV. On the basis of this comparison, we conclude that the stability of A-AF on V and c-AF on V can be switched by slight change of chemical composition, because of these quite close energies, irrespective of a magnetic phase of the Fe. Our results partially supports the work of Nakamura et al. . The subtle differences between our results and Nakamura et al`s results are caused by different exchange correlation potentials and/or initial conditions; e.g. values of magnetic moments adopted on V and Fe. Clarification of this issue requires further computational analysis on a larger magnetic supercell of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\uf064. In a consequence of the analysis, we define a ferromagnetic (FM) phase and a Ferri. phase of the V in oxygen deficient supercells. Table 2 shows several different magnetic configurations of the V and their \uf044E for \uf064 = 0, 0.25, 0.50, provided that magnetic configurations of the Fe is fixed as s-AF. In this case, we relaxed the internal coordinates. The noticeable relaxation occurred only along the c-axis within 0.02 nm, and the relaxation trends were almost the same among each configuration. As shown in the first block of Table 2, the \uf044E of several magnetic configurations on the V layer show close values. The theoretical magnetic phases of the V exhibit similar \uf044E in A-AF, FM, c-AFs, and Ferri. phases. For oxygen-deficient conditions \u03b4 = 0.25 and 0.50, a clear difference is observed in the magnitude of the magnetic moment of the V, although the similarity of \uf044E remains the same.  Upon removal of the oxygen, the V loses one of its bonded O in the supercell. Both of A-AF phase of the V for \uf064 = 0.25 and c-AF phase of the V for \uf064 = 0.50 behave as a kind of Ferri. phase. On the basis of these results, we argue that d electron is rather localized on around the V ions exhibiting magnetic moment from 1.9 \uf06d B to 2.3 \uf06d B . Such different magnetic moments of the V breaks the magnetic balance of the V sublattice, possibly stabilizing Ferri. phase of V. Our calculations verify that the magnetic ground states of the V are A-AF for \uf064 = 0, Ferri. for \uf064 = 0.25, and c-AF with small spontaneous magnetic moments for \uf064 = 0.50 in the virtual superlattice of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\uf064 . The calculated stabilities of magnetic phases of the V are consistent with experimental results for \uf064 ~0, ~0.25, and ~0.50.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support a presence of several magnetic phases for the V sublattice. Provided there is a linear relation between \u03b4 and the lattice volume, a-\u03b4 and c-\u03b4 curves change systematically with \u03b4. Bulk superconductivity are observed in the samples with 0.031 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.145. The samples with 0.204 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.664 show normal conductivity at T > 2 K, although SC-traces were observed in the samples with 0.204 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.237.   These SC-traces are mainly due to the magnetic phase segregation.The highest T c onset and T c mid were 37.1 K and 34.1 K, respectively, for \u03b4 = 0.145 sample. A spontaneous magnetic moment (M S ) of the V appears for the samples with 0.124 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.631. The M S exhibits a maximum value of ~0.5 \uf06d B (f.u.) \u22121 for \u03b4 = 0.267 sample.    0.124 \u2264 \u03b4 \u22640.631 samples exhibit magnetic transition temperatures of the V ranging from 25 to 308 K.   57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spctra of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 exhibit PM phase of the Fe sublattice for superconducting \u03b4 = 0.124 sample and normalconducting samples with \u03b4 = 0.232 and 0.237, whereas AFM phases of Fe appear at T < 11.9 K, 17.5 K, and 23.1 K for the samples with \u03b4 = 0.267, 0.509, and 0.631.Our DFT calculations show that a stable AFM phase of the V can be switched, depending on the \u03b4, because the stability of the magnetic phases are quite similar in energy. In addition, our DFT calculations indicate that the Ferri. phase of the V is the most stable in the samples with \u03b4 = 0.25.Based on these results, an electronic and magnetic phase diagram of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 is constructed with respect to \u03b4. This phase diagram provides an evidence that there is no coexisting AFM phase of the Fe sublattice with SC, although a higher maximum of T c appears near a boundary between the AFM and Ferri. phases of V. Magnetic and valence states of the V dominate T c of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 indirectly.

Although there are samples prepared using same nominal compositions, the obtained samples exhibit different a, c, and V. These results indicate that nominal compositions are not equal to intrinsic chemical compositions for Sr 2 VFeAsO 3 phase.  Therefore, an analytical approach is required for determination of the samples' chemical compositions as analyte (54). Provided that the intrinsic oxygen deficiencies correlate linearly to the V of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3 phase, the dashed line denotes a d-V calibration line for intrinsic oxygen deficiency (\u03b4). The d-V calibration line is obtained based on three samples showing smaller amount of second phases than other samples. The three samples are d = 0.15 with (a = 0.393353(2) nm, c = 1.56938(1) nm, V = 0.242824(3) nm 3 ), d = 0.20 with (a = 0.393299(2) nm, c = 1.57175(2) nm, V = 0.243125(3) nm 3 ), and d = 0.52 with (a = 0.393188(2) nm, c = 1.57730(1) nm, V = 0.243845(4) nm 3 ). An inverse function of the d-V calibration line is written as \u03b4 = 377.349(nm \uf02d3 )\uf0d7V - 91.5057. Figure S2 shows powder XRD patterns of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 .  Each sample contained second phases.Figure shows XRD patterns of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 (\uf064 = 0.509) observed and simulated by Rietveld refinement. It is revealed that the total amount of impurity phases is ~7 vol. % for \uf064 = 0.509 sample.  Table summarizes crystallographic data of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3-\u03b4 (\u03b4 = 0.509) at room temperature obtained by the Rietveld analysis. The space group is P4/nmm. The atomic coordinates are as follows: Sr1 (0.75, 0.75, z), Sr2 (0.75, 0.75, z), V (0.25, 0.25, z), Fe (0.25, 0.75, 0), As (0.25, 0.25, z), O1 (0.25, 0.75, z), O2 (0.25, 0.25, z). The definitions of the two As-Fe-As bond angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and pnictogen height (h pn ) in FeAs layer and the V-O1-V bond angle \u03b3 in Sr 2 VO 3-\u03b4 layer are illustrated with the tetrahedrons as shown in Fig. 1(b). BVS means the bond valence sum (53), which is obtained from the bond length of between every valence of V and O. Effective valence states of V are less than positive trivalent in Sr 2 VFeAsO 3-\uf064 . Valence states of vanadium for Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 are also quantified based on XRF measurements for V-K \uf0611 level of V, V 2 O 3 , V 2 O 5 , (55-57) and Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 (\uf064 = 0.267, 0.664).  Oxygen contents of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 are quantified based on intensity of O-K \uf0611 emission.Figure shows XRD patterns for V, V 2 O 3 , and V 2 O 5 as samples used for energy calibration.  Figure exhibits XRF spectra for V, V 2 O 3 , V 2 O 5 , and Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 (\uf064 = 0.267, 0.664) at Energy (E) = 0-15 keV.  Although each element of the compounds has been detected by XRF measurements, peak overlap is observed in O-K \uf0611 , V-L \uf0611 , and V-L \uf062 spectra for each sample. As shown in Figure S4C, V-K \uf061 peaks are decomposed into individual spectra (V-K \uf0611,2 ) using the pseudo-Voigt function (Gaussian-Lorentzian sum function).Valence states of vanadium ions are also determined by peak energies for V-K \uf0611 .  There is no contradiction between the results of XRF analysis and the results of BVS analysis. A matrix effect (58) gives ten times smaller emission from V and O atoms in Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 than those from a vanadium metal and vanadium oxides. As shown in Fig. S4D, intensities of XRF spectra in metal V, V 2 O 3 , and V 2 O 5 could not be simply applied for quantitative analysis on chemical composition of oxygen contents with respect to V in Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 , because the state of bonds of V and O and crystal structure of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 are different from those of V 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 . The relationship of peak intensities between O-K\u03b1 1 and V-L\u03b1 1, V-L\u03b2 1 of the Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 is in opposite to those of V 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 due to the matrix effect. A semi-quantitative analysis is demonstrated for the oxygen contents. V-L \uf0611 , V-L \uf0621 , and O-K \uf0611 peaks are also decomposed into individual spectra in V, V 2 O 3 , V 2 O 5 , and Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 .Figure S4E shows expanded view of the analysis for Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 .Although a curve is obtained for quantitative analysis on oxygen contents from XRF of V, V 2 O 3 , and V 2 O 5 , the curve could not be used for the quantitative analysis on oxygen contents in Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4.Figure shows the curve."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

It should be noted that there are difficulties to determine quantitative oxygen contents of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 with XRF.   Primary reasons are following: (i) The energy of V-L\u03b1 1, V-L\u03b2 1 , and O-K\u03b1 1 are very close in the range of 0.01 keV, which is detection limit of WDX, and the observed V-L\u03b1 1, V-L\u03b2 1 and O-K\u03b1 1 spectrum largely overlapped.Therefore, provided the spectrum of them are divided by least squares fitting, the arbitrariness of fitting inevitably occurs. (ii) The calibration of oxygen contents with V metal , V 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 (Fig. S4F(a) could not been applied to determine chemical composition of O with respect to V in Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 ,bacause the state of bonds of V and O and crystal structure of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 are different from those of V 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 . (iii) Because of the matrix effect, the relationship of peak intensity or peak area between O-K\u03b1 1 and V-L\u03b1 1, V-L\u03b2 1 of the samples Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 is opposite to that of V 2 O 3 and V 2 O 5 (See Fig. S4D).(iv) Although it was possible to distinguish crystallographic phase of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 and that of impurity phase with Electron Probe Micro Analyzer (EPMA), it was difficult to detect O-K\u03b1 1 spectrum with superior S/N ratio with EPMA, because the measurement range of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 crystals is ~ \uf06dm order and the sufficient intensity of O-K\u03b1 1 spectrum could been hardly detected.   Fig. S5. The superconducting properties of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 under magnetic fields.

Furthermore, magnetic-field dependent thermal conductivity experiments are consistent with d-wave superconductivity.The first-order nature of the superconducting transition in magnetic fields and a second anomaly observed close to H c2 below 1 K make CeCoIn 5 an excellent candidate for a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state .

In this model, anomalous NFL T -dependences of C(T ) and \u03c1(T ) due to critical AFM spin fluctuations are calculated as a function of reduced temperature T /T 0 , with a control parameter y 0 denoting the distance from the QCP (i.e., y 0 =0 at the QCP) that provides a measure of the inverse correlation length.

Moreover, no sign of an anomaly associated with magnetic order is found at T = 60 mK in the magnetoresistance (Fig. 3a) [or C(H, T )]; such an anomaly is expected to occur if superconductivity was suppressed more rapidly than the critical point.

The quantum fluctuations of this unusual NFL state are circumvented by the formation of superconductivity at finite temperature. Such a scenario may, in fact, be realized in CeCoIn 5\u2212x Sn x ; Sn substitution and/or magnetic field tune the quantum phase transition while superconductivity acts as a veil that is parasitic to the abundant low-energy quan- tum fluctuations. Once the underlying phase is destroyed at H QCP = H c2 , the protective envelope of superconductivity is no longer necessary and the system exhibits critical behav- ior in the vicinity of the QCP, leading to the phase diagram shown in Fig. 4.

It is also important for assessing the proposed pairing mechanism arising from in-plane confinement, namely the interlayer tunneling (ILT) theory which was proposed by Ander- son and co-workers . Although great effort has been devoted to the accurate measurement of \u03bb c , the exper- imental results are still controversial. For example, for optimally doped La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 , optical and surface impedance measurements found \u03bb c (T = 0K) \u2243 4\u00b5m, in agreement with the prediction of ILT theory.  On the other hand for Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+x , vortex imaging and optical measurements yielded \u03bb c (0) \u2243 19\u00b5m, and more recent optical measurements gave 12\u00b5m . These high values of \u03bb c (0) cannot be easily accounted by the ILT model . Furthermore, for nearly opti- mally doped HgBa 2 CuO 4+x (T c = 96K), the values of \u03bb c (0) obtained by vortex imaging and optical measurements are \u2243 8\u00b5m and 6\u00b5m, respectively.   How- ever, ac-susceptibility measurements for slightly over- doped HgBa 2 CuO 4+x (T c =93K) give \u03bb c (0) \u2243 1.5\u00b5m in agreement with ILT theory.The large discrepancies in the reported values of \u03bb c (0) for HTS with one CuO 2 plane per unit cell makes it difficult to reach a consensus regarding the trends of \u03bb c (0) in HTS and also the validity of the ILT model .Moreover, the strong dop- ing dependence of both the superconducting and normal state properties and the presence of the pseudogap in under-and optimally doped samples may play a signif- icant role in the behaviour of the c-axis electrodynamics."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Measurements were performed down to 1.2K for LSCO and 4.2K for Hg-1201 using the low-field ac-susceptibility technique with an ac-field of 1G RM S at 333Hz parallel to the CuO 2 planes.For LSCO the value of p is taken to be equal to the Sr content x, whereas for Hg-1201 it was determined by estimating the oxygen content and verified by thermopower measurements as in ref. .   Transport, magnetic and spectroscopic measurements confirmed the high quality of our samples.  The data were analysed using London's model for small aligned crystallites of anisotropic HTS.Details of the technique and data analysis can be found elsewhere . The low-field ac-susceptibility technique gives the fractional diamagnetism of a superconductor and thus is a direct probe of the magnetic penetration depth . For each doping concentration of LSCO, the result presented here is typical of those obtained for four samples prepared in- dependently from the same polycrystalline pellet. Each of these samples was aligned at different times and from each sample 4 pieces were cut and measured. Therefore a total of 16 samples were investigated for each doping content.In the case of Hg-1201, two samples were pre- pared from the same polycrystalline pellet and again 4 pieces of each aligned sample were cut and measured for each doping level.The error of \u03bb c (0) is estimated to be < 8% for LSCO and < 10% for Hg-1201, while the error in the relative temperature dependence \u03bb c (T )/\u03bb c (0) is < 1% and is therefore negligible."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Namely, the value of 1.5\u00b5m that we obtained for a slightly overdoped sample by the ac-susceptibility technique corresponds to the simple situation where there is no normal state gap.  Although the values of Kirtley et al. and Basov et al. correspond to samples with high values of T c (96K) the results shown here strongly suggest that their values of \u03bb c (0) correspond to significantly lower doping levels where the normal state gap comes into play.  In this sense our results support the ILT model-since the only clear exception to this model is now the Tl-2201 compound .However, we should note that for any pairing mechanism (not just ILT) the presence of the normal state gap also leads to a similar correlation be- tween the condensation energy, and the superfluid den- sity, i.e., \u03bb c (0) and \u03bb ab (0) .  There are also dis- tinct differences between \u03bb c and \u03bb ab .

Note the good agreement be- tween the ZFC curve of the dc and ac data. Moreover, the ZFC dc magnetization curve is in fact a FC curve due to a small residual field \u22482 Oe trapped in the superconducting magnet. Both data set yield a \u224830% screening volume; the slightly smaller diamagnetic signal of the dc data is attributed to the comparatively higher field of 100 Oe used, which leads to a larger flux penetration. As discussed in the past , the above shielding fraction is typical for single-phase superconducting cuprates that depends upon various effects including flux pin- ning, among others.  In the present case, considering the ab- sence of impurities, this fraction should be then regarded as a lower limit for the Meissner fraction.We conclude that su- perconductivity is a bulk phenomenon associated with the ox- idized Cu 1\u2212x Mo x Sr 2 YCu 2 O 7+\u03b4 phase.

In particular, unconventional su- perconductivity has been expected in this compound be- cause of the unique crystal structure in the CoO 2 layer al- though the superconducting transition temperature T c \u2243 5 K is one order of magnitude smaller than that in High-T c copper oxide superconductors.   The CoO 2 layer is formed by the hexagonal arrangement of the Co ions, which is in contrast to the tetragonal arrangement of the Cu ions in the copper oxides.A deficiency of the sodium atom leads to dope 0.65 holes into the layer of the insu- lating low-spin (S = 0) state of Co +3 .  This hole doping results in 0.35 electrons doped in the triangular lattice consisting of S = 1/2 of Co +4 . Such triangular magnetic lattice is regarded as having magnetic frustration and one may expect that unconventional superconductivity is realized on the basis of such frustration. Then just af- ter finding the superconductivity in the present material, many theoretical proposals of possible unconventional superconductivity have been presented. The exper- imental investigation on the superconductivity, however, has not progressed so much because of difficulty of get- ting the single crystal. It is highly desirable to obtain the basic superconducting parameters in magnetic field, for example, the upper critical field H c2 , the coherence length \u03be, and those anisotropy.These basic material pa- rameters must be important to understand NMR and NQR results reported so far, which should give cru- cial information about the pairing symmetry and the gap anisotropy."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The deintercalation of Na and hydration process to obtain the superconductiv- ity is similar way reported by Takada et al.

The typical size of the single crystal is 1 \u00d7 0.6 \u00d7 0.02 mm 3 . The in- plane resistivity was measured by standard dc four probe method. In order to make the electrical contact to the sample, the gold wires (10 \u00b5m\u03c6) were attached with sil- ver paste which dried for 30 minutes at a few C \u2022 . The samples were fixed to the single-axis rotatable holder for resistivity measurements in magnetic fields and cooled quickly below ice point because of avoiding the partial de- hydration from the sample.  We paid attention to handle the samples in cold condition.For instance, the samples were placed on the aluminum plate cooled by ice during the preparation of the electrical contact under micro- scope. The magnetic susceptibility was measured with a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS-XL5). Figure shows the temperature dependence of the in- plane resistivity of the single crystal sample in the cool- ing process.

The dotted and solid curves corresponding to 0.9\u03c1 n and 0.001\u03c1 n are guides for eyes.  Here we use the resistive criteria 0.9\u03c1 n and 0.001\u03c1 n for the upper critical field H c2 and the irreversibility field H irr in conventional way although such criteria are not sound exactly correct for thermo- dynamic transitions.The initial slope of H c2 (T ) at T c shown as the dashed lines are \u22120.53 and \u22124.7 T/K in the field parallel to the c-axis and ab-plane.  Theses values of the slope are in agreement with the previous reports. 8, 10) From these initial slopes, the Ginzburg -Landau coherence length \u03be can be calculated by using the relation , where \u03a6 0 = hc/2e = 2.07 \u00d7 10 \u221211 T\u2022cm 2 and i, j, and k are cyclic permutations of the directions. Here we assume the isotropic \u03be in the ab-plane, that is \u03be i = \u03be j = \u03be ab and \u03be k = \u03be c . Following the equations the coherence lengths are calculated to be \u03be ab \u2243 12 nm and \u03be c \u2243 1.3 nm. It is noted that the interlayer coherence length \u03be c is longer than the interlayer spacing, about 0.98 nm, of the CoO 2 layers. 1) Accordingly the anisotropy calculated from \u03be is about 9.2, which may be a lower limit value of the anisotropy considering the experimental uncertainty de- scribed before. This moderate size of the anisotropy is almost comparable to that of the pyridine intercalated transition metal dicalcogenides (\u223c 20), organics (\u223c 10) and Sr 2 RuO 4 (\u223c 20) and is larger than that of the alkali intercalated nitrides (\u223c 4). In compar- ison with the High-T c copper oxides, the anisotropy of the present cobalt oxide is located between the value of YB 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 and the La-based cuprates.   One may ex- pect larger anisotropy than the observed value because of expanding largely the interlayer spacing between the CoO 2 layers by intercalation of H 2 O molecules. But it is much smaller than that of the Bi-based cuprates.   The reason may be due to longer interlayer coherence length than the interlayer spacing of the CoO 2 layers.The upper critical field at T = 0 K can be estimated from Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula 17) by using the initial slope, (0) are about 1.7 T and 15 T in the field parallel to the c-axis and ab-plane, respectively. In the magnetic field parallel to the c-axis, the H c c2 (T ) line looks likely to be pointing to H WHH c2 (0).  On one hand, H ab c2 (T ) is strongly suppressed from H WHH c2 (0) in the low temperature region.This suppression may arise from the singlet pair breaking by Zeeman effect, that is so-called Clogston-Chandrasekhar limit or Pauli paramagnetic limit.The value of Pauli paramagnetic limit is simply described as H P = 1.84T c .According to T c = 4.5 K, H P \u2243 8.3 T.As can be seen in , the actual H ab c2 (T ) line seems to be suppressed from H WHH c2 (0) to H P .Such suppression by Zeeman effect may suggest the spin singlet superconductivity in the present cobalt oxide superconductor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This phenomenon was also observed in the Y Sr 2 Cu 2.7 F e 0.3 O 7+\u03b4 superconductor and in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 superconductor ob- tained by high oxygen pressure synthesis.  In these superconductors, the diffraction peaks of (006) and (200) shift systematically to higher angle degree with the increase of oxygen content, which is similar to our results. All our HP-samples have smaller lattice parameters a and c than the corresponding AM-samples, and the lattice unit cell of HP-samples displays an obvious shrinkage.   Since the relative shrinkage is not more bigger than other samples an- nealed under high oxygen pressure, and also for that F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 sample can be made superconducting without high pressure synthesis, thereby this shrinkage can be attributed to the increase of oxygen content, but not the pressure effect caused by the high pressure synthesis procedure.Then it can be deduced that in all F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 (Ba 1\u2212x Sr x ) 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 samples the oxygen content increased after high pressure synthesis, which is validated by the oxygen content measurement in F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 system where 7+\u03b4 increased from 7.20(2) in AM-sample to 7.35(2) in HP-sample. The increased oxygen content provided the required charge which made the semiconducting-like AM-samples changed to supercon- ducting HP-samples. The diffusion of F e atom into CuO 2 planes in R-123 systems is believed to be very unfavorable for superconductivity because of its magnetic moment, and with the increase of F e concentration, this diffusion is inevitable in samples synthesized by common solid-state reaction .     J.Shimoyama et al. used a complex annealing procedure which is believed to suppress the incorporation of F e to the CuO 2 planes in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 system, and finally made it superconducting with T c \u223c 60K.Using neutron powder diffraction studies, T.Mochiku et al. investigated the site-mixing between F e and Cu atoms in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 samples synthesized through different procedures, and proved that simply increasing the oxygen content could not produce superconductivity and the ordered distribution of F e and Cu atoms between Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites is also one of the key points to the origin of superconductivity.In our heavily F e-doped R-1212 systems, high pressure synthesis procedure is believed to promote the transfer of F e atoms from Cu(2) site to Cu(1) site, and to make almost all the F e atoms to occupy the Cu(1) chain site.This redistribution of F e atoms is a needed requirement to ensure the occurrence of superconductivity, while the increase of oxygen content provides the needed amount of charge."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Among CeMIn 5 , CeIrIn 5 and CeCoIn 5 show superconductivity at P = 0 below T c = 0.4 K and 2.3 K, respectively .    Antiferromagnet CeRhIn 5 be- comes superconducting at relatively lower critical pres- sure P c \u223c 1.GPa and yet exhibits a higher T c \u223c 2 K . Measurements of nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) , thermal transport and heat capac- ity on CeMIn 5 found that the superconductivity is unconventional, with line-nodes in the superconducting gap function.NQR and inelastic neutron diffraction measurements also found strong antifer- romagnetic spin fluctuations in the normal state. In addi- tion, in CeIrIn 5 , the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found to be anisotropic, namely, a magnetic corre- lation length \u03be plane within the tetragonal plane grows up more dominantly than \u03be c along the c-axis associated with their two-dimensional crystal structure.The nuclear- spin-lattice-relaxation rate(1/T 1 ) was found to follow the relation of 1/T 1 T \u221d 1/(T + \u03b8) 3/4 with a small value of \u03b8 = 8 K .  The same analysis was applied to CeCoIn 5 with resulting \u03b8 = 0.6 K .Note that \u03b8 is a measure to what extent the system is close to an antiferromag- netic quantum critical point (QCP).It was suggested that the difference in the value of \u03b8 between CeIrIn 5 and CeCoIn 5 may lead to the large difference in the value of T c."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

To avoid crystal distortions, however, the grain's diameters were kept larger than 100 \u00b5m. CeIrIn 5 consists of alternating layers of CeIn 3 and IrIn 2 and hence has two inequiva- lent In sites per unit cell.  The 115 In-NQR measure- ments were made at the In(1) site which is located on the top and bottom faces of the tetragonal unit cell. Since the position of In(1) site is crystallographically closer to Ce nucleus than that of In(2) site, it is suited to investigate the relationship between superconductiv- ity and magnetic correlations. In-NQR measurement was made by a conventional saturation-recovery method. The 115 In-NQR T 1 was measured at the transition of 2\u03bd Q (\u00b13/2 \u2194 \u00b15/2) above T = 1.4 K, but at 1\u03bd Q (\u00b11/2 \u2194 \u00b13/2) below T = 1.4 K. The hydrostatic pres- sure was applied by utilizing BeCu piston-cylinder cell, filled with Daphne oil (7373) as a pressure-transmitting medium.  The value of pressure at low temperature was determined from the pressure dependence of the T c value of Sn metal measured by a conventional four terminal method.For our pressure cells, the spatial distribution in values of pressure \u2206P/P is estimated to be \u223c 3% from a broadening in the linewidth of NQR spectrum."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In order to gain an insight into this issue, we focus on the pressure-induced evolution of magnetic fluctuations in the normal state in CeIrIn 5 . and its inset show the 1/T 1 T versus T plots in CeIrIn 5 at P = 0, 1.0, 1.58 and 2.1 GPa and LaIrIn 5 at P = 0 GPa in linear and logarithmic scales, respec- tively.    At P = 0 GPa, the T dependence of 1/T 1 T above T c is well explained by the anisotropic antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations model . As seen in , the application of pressure markedly suppresses the antifer- romagnetic spin fluctuations, bringing the system away from the antiferromagnetic QCP.As a result, a relation of 1/T 1 T = const. becomes valid over T = 1 \u2212 100 K at P = 2.1 GPa without the development of antiferromag- netic spin fluctuations upon cooling. On the other hand, it should be noted that, as seen in , the values of 1/T 1 T and \u03b3 \u223c 0.25 J/K 2 mol for CeIrIn 5 at P = 2.1 GPa are one order of magnitude larger than that for LaIrIn 5 . These results indicate that strong electron cor- relation still plays a central role to enhance the values of 1/T 1 T and \u03b3, even though antiferromagnetic spin fluc- tuations disappear in CeIrIn 5 under pressure.This is in contrast to the case for CeCoIn 5 and CeRhIn 5 in which antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations enhance 1/T 1 T upon cooling, even though each system is away from the anti- ferromagnetic QCP with applying pressure ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In CeCoIn 5 , the application of pressure also significantly suppresses 1/T 1 that is dom- inated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations specific to the antiferromagnetic QCP. It shows very good agree- ment with specific heat measurements under pressure.  Although a jump in specific heat at T c (\u2206C/\u03b3(T c ) \u223c 5) has a surprisingly large value at ambient pressure, in- dicative of a strong coupling superconductivity, this value shows a marked decrease against applying pressure . Correspondingly, 1/T 1 T is significantly suppressed as pressure increases .Both results suggest that the application of pressure to CeCoIn 5 increases the heavy- fermion bandwidth due to the increase of hybridization between f electrons and conduction electrons and even- tually brings the system away from the antiferromagnetic QCP.   As a result, the superconducting gap or \u2206 0 /k B T c in CeCoIn 5 decreases as shown in in- set. Noting that, in CeCoIn 5 , the 1/T 1 T is intimately enhanced upon cooling to T c , it is expected that antifer- romagnetic spin fluctuations play a role in mediating the Cooper pairs even when the system is away from the an- tiferromagnetic QCP under pressure. Nevertheless, the enhancement of T c with applying pressure was sug- gested to be relevant to the increase in heavy-fermion bandwidth that is expected to make the lifetime of quasi- particles long enough.In this context, the Cooper pairs in CeCoIn 5 may originate from attractive interaction in- duced by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.It was hence argued that, in the presence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, the value of T c may be controlled by the combined effect of coupling strength for the Cooper-pair formation due to the closeness to the antiferromagnetic QCP and the heavy-fermion bandwidth in CeCoIn 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth \u03bb is consistent with that expected for a weak- coupled s-wave BCS superconductor. However, to rule out completely d-wave symmetry, additional low temperatures measurements are required. A pronounced and positive pres- sure effect on T c with dT c /dp = 0.090(1) K/kbar was observed, in contrast to the negative pressure shift generally detected in conventional superconductors. This finding can be ex- plained within the framework of BCS theory under the assumption that the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb el\u2212ph increases with pressure.

In the case of La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO), recent angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) studies have shown that in underdoped samples, the chemical potential \u00b5 is pinned at \u223c0.4 eV above the top of the lower Hubbard band (more precisely, top of the Zhang-Rice singlet band) and spectral weight is transferred from the lower Hubbard band to near \u00b5 with hole doping. Also, it has been found from the photoemission measurements of core levels that the chemical potential does not move with hole doping in the underdoped region . These observations indicate a breakdown of the rigid-band picture and are sugges- tive of a dramatic reorganization of the electronic struc- ture upon hole doping. In fact, the suppression of the chemical potential shift has been attributed to the strong stripe fluctuations in LSCO because the charge stripes can be viewed as a kind of microscopic phase separation which will pin the chemical potential.  More recently, it has been found that the chemical potential in the electron-doped superconductor Nd 2\u2212x Ce x CuO 4 (NCCO) shows a monotonous shift without any sign of suppres- sion, indicating a more rigid-band-like behavior . The absence of a suppression of the shift in NCCO is consis- tent with the absence of stripe fluctuations in this sys- tem ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The en- ergy resolution was about 0.8 eV, which was largely due to the width of the photon source. The samples were cleaved in situ to obtain clean surfaces and measured at \u223c 80 K. The base pressure in the analyzer chamber was \u223c 1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 Torr. All the spectra presented here were taken within four hours after cleaving and no change was observed in the spectra during the measurement. In order to avoid sample degradation or contamination, the sam- ples were cooled to about 80 K. In XPS measurements, high voltages of \u223c1 kV have to be applied to the elec- tron energy analyzer to decelerate photoelectrons, and it is usually difficult to measure the binding energies with an accuracy of < 100 meV. In order to overcome this dif- ficulty, we monitored the applied voltages directly, and confirmed that the uncertainty could be reduced to less than 10 meV . Furthermore, in order to eliminate other unexpected causes of errors, we measured the x Pr = 0.25 and x Er = 0.1 sample as a reference following the mea- surement of each sample.

It has been demonstrated that if the shifts of the metal and oxygen core levels are the same, K\u2206Q and \u2206V M are negligibly small . Core-hole screen- ing by conduction electrons can also be excluded from the main origin of the core-level shifts in transition-metal ox- ides . As mentioned above, in the region \u03b4 > 0.1, the Bi 4f, Sr 3d and O 1s core levels show similar behaviors and therefore we can safely conclude that the shifts are primarily caused by the chemical potential shift. In the region \u03b4 < 0.1, the doping dependences of the core lev- els are complicated, most likely due to charge transfer from the CuO 2 layers (CuO 2 -Ca 1\u2212x R x -CuO 2 blocks) to the Bi-O layers with decreasing \u03b4 and the resulting de- crease of the Bi valence. Considering the crystal chem- istry of BSCCO, the SrO layer is supposed to have fixed charges and the Sr 3d level would be least influenced by the charge transfer, and we assume that the shift of the Sr 3d level most faithfully reflects the chemical potential shift in the entire hole concentration region.  Indeed, the shift of the O 1s peak from the SrO layer as well as that from the CuO 2 layer deduced from the line-shape analy- sis show nearly the same behavior and is most probably caused by the chemical potential shift. shows the chemical potential shift \u2206\u00b5 relative to \u03b4 = 0 thus deduced for the Er-and Pr-substituted BSCCO samples. The shift is slow in the underdoped regime, and becomes faster as the hole concentration in- creases. The depression of the chemical potential shift in the underdoped region, i.e., |\u2202\u00b5/\u2202\u03b4| \u2192 0 as \u03b4 \u2192 0, has been predicted by numerical studies of the two- dimensional Hubbard model and t-J model . In the Monte Carlo simulations , the calculated \u2206\u00b5 follows \u2206\u00b5 \u221d \u2212\u03b4 2 . The measured \u2206\u00b5 in BSCCO can be relatively well fitted to \u2212\u03b4 2 as shown in .

(f) Hole and electron mobilities used in the model calculations.  we look at the measured Hall coefficient at a tempera- ture of 5 K, shown by the circles in Fig. , we see that it varies smoothly with doping. A more sensible in- terpretation can be obtained with a model that contains contributions from both holes and electrons : where N h (N e ) is the density of holes (electrons) and b = \u00b5 e /\u00b5 h , the ratio of mobilities of the electrons and holes. As mentioned in the introduction, we know from previous transport studies that N h is finite even at x = 0, grows with x up to at least x \u223c 0.1, while ARPES studies suggest that the hole pockets continue to grow slowly at larger x. Hence, we model N h by assuming that it is small but finite at x = 0 and grows linearly with x.  In contrast, we assume that the electron- like carriers correspond to impurity states introduced by In 3+ , and so we take N e to be equal to the density of In ions, as indicated in Fig. . The key to the crossover in dominant carrier type is the mobility ratio, b. We assume that the In-based states are slightly below the chemical potential of pure SnTe, and that these states are localized when x is small. As x increases, the In-induced states can hybridize with one another, so that these states can begin to contribute to the transport.We model this with a mobility ratio b that starts out small, but then grows rapidly towards one at larger x; the product N e b 2 is indicated by the dashed line in Fig. .  With these choices, we obtain the solid line in Fig. , which gives a good description of R H (x). Of course, in modeling R H we have introduced more degrees of freedom than we have constraints. To test the model further, it is useful to consider the magnitude of \u03c1, which depends on both the carrier densities and the mobilities. The magnitude of the hole mobility is con- strained by previous work on samples with x 0.1: the mobility starts off as \u223c 500 cm 2 /(V s) at x = 0 and then rapidly drops on the introduction of In, decreasing by two orders of magnitude by x \u223c 0.1. We assume that that the hole mobility then remains constant at 5 cm 2 /(V s).Meanwhile, the electron mobility starts out at a negligi- ble level and steadily rises, becoming comparable to the hole mobility at x \u223c 0.25.Using the model mobilities plotted in Fig. together with the carrier densities shown in Fig. , we obtain for \u03c1 the solid line plotted in Fig. , which certainly captures the trend of the experimental data points."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Although the theoretical calculations of Tc values are not so accurate, the observed T c value seems to be too high to be accounted for by ordinary electron-phonon coupling mechanisms.In addition, some unusual phenomena in these systems are known to exist.

The estimated extra entropy down to 1.4K is about 43.2mJ/mol, which is only 0.25% of the 3Rln2, the value that is expec- ted for Cu 2+ free spins.Although this upturn behavior looks interesting, the possibility of con- tributions from small amounts of impurity phases (-0.5%) cannot be ruled out, as already pointed out above.However, the origin of the non-zero 7 value at low temperatures is not yet under- stood clearly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Nevertheless, peculiar properties were revealed in Li 0.9 Mo 6 O 17 , and possible triplet SC was proposed. Very recently, we discovered bulk SC at 6.1 K in a Q1D pnictide K 2 Cr 3 As 3 in which correlated Cr-3d electrons are involved.   The crystal structure is characterized by the [(Cr 3 As 3 ) 2\u2212 ] \u221e double-walled subnano-tubes in which Cr 6 (As 6 ) face-sharing octahedron chains constitute the inner (outer) wall. Although the Q1D structural unit resembles the counterpart of Tl 2 Mo 6 Se 6 , the new material hosts series of peculiar physical properties including a large Sommerfeld coefficient of 70 mJ K \u22122 mol \u22121 , a linear temperature dependence of resistivity from 7 to 300 K, high upper critical fields exceeding the Pauli limit, and a power law dependence of elec- tronic specific heat in the superconducting state.Our first-principles calculations indicate that the electrons around E F are dominated by the Cr-3d states, which form two Q1D Fermi surface (FS) sheets and one 3D FS pockets. The calculated 'bare' density of state (DOS) at E F is less than 1/3 of the experimental value from the specific-heat measurement, confirming the electron correlation effect. Besides, ferromagnetic instability and/or ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are revealed, which favors spin-triplet Cooper pairing.These experimental and theoretical-calculation results suggest unconventional SC in K 2 Cr 3 As 3 ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

For example, unlike Tl 2 Mo 6 Se 6 which remains metallic and superconducts at 4.2 K, Rb 2 Mo 6 Se 6 undergoes a metal-insulator transition at \u223c 170 K, which is explained in terms of dynamical charge-density wave owing to the reduced interchain hopping.  Thus, the appearance of SC in K 2 Cr 3 As 3 suggests a significant in- terchain coupling, as revealed by the existence of 3D FS. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to investigate the effect of interchain coupling by the elemental replacement (e.g., Rb for K) in the spacer columns.  Furthermore, it is important to check whether the unconventional SC is a common feature in the Q1D Cr-based pnictides.In this Communication, we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and physical property measurement of an analogous material Rb 2 Cr 3 As 3 .  Indeed, weaker interchain coupling is signatured by the obviously ex- panded interchain distance, which may account for the broadening of the superconducting transitions.

Furthermore, Rb 2 Cr 3 As 3 suffers significant distortions in the (Cr 3 ) \u221e chains.

If this is not an incidental phenomenon, one may expect higher T c for a larger \u03b3 n value.The estimated upper critical field exceeding the Pauli limit can be a hint for spin-triplet Cooper pairing. Besides, the existence of nodes in the superconducting order parameter, indicated by the thermodynamic anal- ysis, does not contradict with the spin-triplet scenario.Although much work needs to be done for the details of the superconducting order parameter, the fact that the only two existed members (so far) of the Q1D Cr-based materials both show evidences of unconventional SC suggests that the unconventionality should be a common phenomenon in the Cr 3 As 3 -chain based systems."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Due to this DM interaction, the field causes the adjacent spins to cant slightly out of their original direction and to align a component of the moments with the direction of the applied field. Below the irreversible temperature (T irr ,), which is defined as the merging temperature of the zero-field (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) curves, the Ru-Ru interactions begin to dominate, leading to reorientation of the Ru moments, which leads to a peak in the magnetization curves.

The product was cooled, reground and sintered at 1050\u00b0C for 50 h in a slightly pressurized oxygen atmosphere (\u223c1.1 atm) and then furnace cooled to ambient temperature (asp samples).

In addition, the SC transition width may be due to the spontaneous vortex state discussed in detail in Ref. 4. In the next section we suggest an intuitive explanation as to why the M-2122 (M= Ru, Ta and Nb) materials are superconducting.  Given the variety of crystal structures and the chemical methods used to introduce holes into the CuO 2 layers, it is well established that a \"generic' electronic phase diagram can be sketched for all compounds.The hole (or carrier) density (p) in the CuO 2 planes, or deviation of the formal Cu valence from Cu 2+ , is a primary parameter, which affects T C in most of the HTSC compounds. In the well-established phase diagram La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 , the stoichiometric parent La 2 CuO 4 is AFM and insulating. The magnetic interactions are well described by a simple Heisenberg model, with a large exchange interaction (J= 1500 K) value.  In La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 the charge carrier concentration, can be varied by replacing Sr 2+ for La 3+ (or by removal or addition of oxygen in YBa 2 Cu 3 O z ) . The variation of T C as a function of hole doping exhibits a bell shape behavior, with a peak for the optimally doped material (x=0.15 for La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 ). The Eu, Ce and Ru ion valencies in Eu 1.5 Ce 0.5 RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-\u03b4 have been studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS) and X-ray-absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques . MS performed at 90 and 300 K on 151 Eu show a single narrow line with an isomer shift of 0.69(2) mm/s, indicating that the Eu ions are trivalent with a nonmagnetic J=0 ground state.  XAS taken at L III edges of Ce shows also that Ce is tetravalent.XAS taken at the K edge of Ru, at room temperature indicates clearly that the Ru ions are pentavalent .It is also apparent, that bulk SC in the M-2122 system appears only for pentavalent M ions and both Nb-2122 and Ta-2122 materials are SC with T C 28-30 K 1 ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Note the ferromagnetic-like shape of the FC branches. T M (Ru) is not at T irr . The M/H(T) curves do not lend themselves to an easy determination of T M (Ru), and T M (Ru)=165 K, was obtained directly from the temperature dependence of the saturation moment (M sat ), discussed below. [An alternative way to determine T M (Ru) is to cool the material from above T M , under a small negative magnetic field (say -5 Oe), which aligns the Ru sublattice. At low temperatures, a small positive (5 Oe) is applied. Due to the high anisotropy, the Ru moments remain opposite the field direction up to T M . The measured negative M(T) curve becomes zero at T M ]. T irr is field dependent, and shifted to lower temperatures with the applied field. T irr =91, 64, 39, 28 and 14 K for H= 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Oe respectively. For higher external fields the irreversibility is washed out, and both ZFC and FC curves collapse to a single ferromagnetic-like behavior. It appears that the magnetic properties of Ru in EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 are all enhanced, as compared to the asp Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-\u03b4 samples with x<1.  The effect of Ce concentration on the magnetic parameters of the Ru sublattice will be discussed below. Similar M/H(T) curves were performed to the oxygen annealed (hop) sample, and Fig. 3 shows that both T irr and T M (Ru) remain unchanged. This is in contrast to Eu 1.5 Ce 0.5 RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-\u03b4 where annealing under the same oxygen pressure affects T irr and T M (Ru) and shift them to higher temperatures 6 . As stated above, the oxygen concentration in EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 is fixed and does not change during the annealing process. On the other hand, during the quenching process, a small amount of oxygen is depleted and both T irr and T M (Ru) are shifted to 169 and 215 K respectively (Fig. 3).  It reminiscent of the magnetic phase-diagram of YBa 2 Cu 3 O z (z<6.5), where the depletion of oxygen increases the magnetic transition of the CuO 2 planes.M(H) measurements at various temperatures for the asp, hop and quenched samples have been carried out, and the results obtained for the asp sample are exhibited in Figs. the W-FM contribution of the Ru sub lattice, and H is the linear paramagnetic contribution of Eu and Cu).  The saturation moment obtained at 5 K is M sat = 0.89(1)\u00b5 B . Similar M(H) curves have been measured at various temperatures and Fig. 5 (inset) shows the decrease of M sat with temperature. M sat becomes zero at T M (Ru)=165(2). Similar M sat and T M (Ru) values were obtained for the hop material. However, for the quenched material, the saturation moment at 5 K remains unchanged, but T M is shifted to 215 (2) K. Thus, only the magnetic transitions are sensitive to the oxygen concentration. The measured M sat = 0.89\u00b5 B , is somewhat smaller than the fully saturated moment 1\u00b5 B expected for the low-spin state of Ru 5+ , i.e. g\u00b5 B S for g=2 and S=0.5. This means that a small canting on adjacent Ru spins occurs, and the saturation moments are not the full moments of the Ru 5+ ions. The exact nature of the local structural distortions causing DM exchange coupling in Ru-2122 (see above) is not presently known. At low applied fields, the M(H) curve exhibits a typical ferromagnetic-like hysteresis loop (Fig. 6) similar to that reported in Ref. 3. The positive virgin curve at low fields, indicates clearly that SC is totally suppressed, Two other characteristic parameters of the hysteresis loops are shown in Fig. 6, namely, the remanent moment, (M rem = 0.41\u00b5 B /Ru) and the coercive field (H C = -190 Oe at 5 K). This M rem is much larger than M rem =0.035 \u00b5 B obtained for EuSr 2 RuCu 2 O 8 12 . The same M rem and H C values (at 5 K) were obtained for the hop and quenched materials. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of M rem (5 K) which disappears at T irr .  The large M rem (0.41\u00b5 B at 5 K) in relation to the saturation moment (M sat = 0.89\u00b5 B ) is consistent with ferromagnetic-like order in EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 , although neutron diffraction measurements are required to precisely determine the nature of the magnetic order. M(H) curves measured at various temperatures yield the M rem (T) and H C (T) values which are plotted in Fig. 5 (inset). For both the asp and quenched samples M rem (T) also disappear at T irr , and H C (T) become zero around 80 K and 130 K respectively (Fig. 5).Above T M (Ru), the (T) curve at 10 kOe, for asp EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 has the typical paramagnetic shape and adheres closely to the Curie-Weiss (CW) law: \u03c7 =\u03c7 0 +C/(T-\u03b8), where \u03c7 0 is the temperature independent part of \u03c7, C is the Curie constant, and \u03b8 is the CW temperature.  The net paramagnetic Ru contribution to (T), was obtained by subtracting (T) of EuCeNbSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 (the reference material) from the measured data. This procedure yields: \u03c7 0 =0.0063 and C=0.57(1) emu/mol Oe and \u03b8= 146(1) K, which corresponds to an effective moment P eff =2.13 \u00b5 B . \u03b8 obtained, is in fair agreement with T M , but P eff is greater than the expected value of the low-spin state of Ru 5+ and S=0.5 (P eff =1.73 \u00b5 B ).  (c) The effect of Ce on the magnetic behavior of Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-\u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4 As stated above, the compounds described here have been prepared simultaneously under the same conditions.Since the magnetic properties of the Ru-2122 system depend strongly on oxygen concentration 6 , the data presented here differ slightly from those reported in our previous publications.  ZFC and FC magnetic as well as isothermal M(H) measurements, have been performed on all Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-\u03b4 (x=0.4-1) compounds. Generally speaking, the magnetic behavior of all materials is quite similar to these described in Figs 3-6 and for the sake of brevity, we display the data obtained for x=0.1 and x=0.5 . It is readily observed, that for x=1, the magnetic properties due to the Ru are all enhanced, as compared to the x=0.5.The latter sample is SC and its ZFC branch starts from negative moments.The inflection in the FC branch agrees well with T c determined from the ac curve .The absence of a complete Meissner effect in the Ru-2122 system is discussed in length elsewhere."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

(d) The qualitative magnetic structure of Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-\u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4 \u03b4 All magnetic parameters (such as T M , T irr and M sat ) are shifted to higher values with increasing Ce. Our general picture is that in Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-\u03b4 all compounds have a similar magnetic structure.  We assume that the small difference between Eu 3+ and Ce 4+ ionic radii discussed above, decreases the mean Ru-Ru distance, and as a result the magnetic exchange interactions become stronger with Ce. While our data described here do not include any determination of the magnetic structural order of the Ru sublattice in Ru-2122, the results are compatible with a simple model which is, however, of use in understanding the qualitative features at low applied fields.Starting from high to low temperatures, the magnetic behavior is basically divided into 4 regions.  (i) At elevated temperatures, the paramagnetic net Ru moment is well described by the CW law, and the extracted P eff =2.15 \u00b5 B and \u03b8=134-146 K values, practically do not alter with Ce. (ii) At T M (depends on Ce content Fig. 8) which is deduced directly from the temperature dependence M sat , the Ru sub lattice becomes AFM ordered. (iii) At T irr < T M , which is Ce dependent ) and also varies with the external field, a weak ferromagnetism is induced, which originates from canting of the Ru moments. T irr is defined as the merging point of the low field ZFC and FC branches, or alternatively, at the temperature in which the remanent moment disappears. This canting arises from the DM anti-symmetric super-exchange interaction, which by symmetry, follows from the fact that the RuO 6 octahedra tilt away from the crystallographic c axis . At high magnetic field (H>3000 Oe) the irreversibility is washed out and the M(T) curves exhibit a ferromagnetic-like behavior.(iv) At lower temperatures SC is induced. shows that T C depends strongly on the R 3+ /Ce 4+ (as hole carriers) and on oxygen concentrations . Below T C , both SC and weak-ferromagnetic states coexist 3,10 and the two states are practically decoupled. This model is supported by our unpublished non-linear ac susceptibility measurements, which show non-linear signals up to T M , and also from Mossbauer studies on 57 Fe doped material 17 .  However, the present interpretation, differs completely from the phase separation of AFM and FM nano-domain particle scenario, suggested in Ref 16.  Neutron diffraction measurements are required to precisely determine the nature of the magnetic order in the Ru-2122 system.In conclusion, the magnetic insulator parent EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 (x=1), is used to describe the coexistence of both SC and weak-ferromagnetism states in Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-\u03b4 (x=0.4-1). For x=1 (\u03b4=0), annealing under high oxygen pressure does not affect the magnetic properties, whereas T M is enhanced by oxygen depletion. Hole doping of the Cu-O planes, which results in SC, can be optimized with appropriate variation of the Eu 3+ / Ce 4+ ratio and the optimally doped material is obtained for Ce=0.6. The magnetic structure of all materials studied is practically the same, but the magnetic parameters, such as T M and M sat , decrease with decreasing Ce content.   Two steps in the magnetic behavior are presented.At T M ranging from 125 K (for x=0.5) to165 K (for x=1) all materials become AFM ordered.At T irr (depends on Ce) a W-FM state is induced, originating from canting of Ru moments.This canting arises from the DM anti-symmetric super-exchange interaction and follows from the fact that the RuO 6 octahedra tilt away from the crystallographic c axis.A direct magnetic structure determination by neutron diffraction or 99 Ru Mossbauer spectroscopy studies are warranted to confirm our assumptions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Resistivity, \u03c1(T), for a number of overdoped to underdoped samples with y \u2265 0.055 showed clear downturns at a characteristic temperature similar to that found at T * in Zn-free underdoped samples because of the presence of the pseudogap.  Contrary to the widely observed behavior for underdoped cuprates at lower Zn contents (where the pseudogap energy increases almost linearly with decreasing p in the same way as for the Zn-free compounds), this apparent pseudogap temperature at high Zn content showed very little or no p-dependence.It also increases systematically with increasing Zn concentration in the CuO 2 planes.  This anomalous behavior appears quite abruptly, e.g., samples with y \u2264 0.05 exhibit the usual T * (p) behavior.

The advantages of using Zn are: (i) It mainly substitutes the in-plane Cu(2) sites, thus the effects of planar impurity can be studied and (ii) the doping level remains nearly the same when Cu(2) is substituted by Zn enabling one to look at the effects of disorder at almost the same hole concentration .Most of the studies on the effect of Zn on charge transport of Y123 are limited to the range of UD to optimum doping levels and at a moderate level of Zn substitution.

Using p-values from S[290K] and the experimental values of T c , a very good fit of T c (p) of the form of eq.(1) was obtained for all the samples.  Fig.shows the case for Y 0.80 Ca 0.20 Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-\u03b4 sintered compounds. There is a systematic shift of p opt towards higher values (from p opt = 0.16 for the impurity-free case) and an increase in Z with increasing Zn content.  These findings have important consequences.Increasing Z(y) implies the shrinkage of the p-range over which the compound is superconducting upon Zn substitution, and the shift of p opt (y) towards higher values implies that the superconducting dome is displaced asymmetrically towards the overdoped side. This latter feature, we believe, is indicative of a fundamental difference between the underdoped and the overdoped regions, namely the existence of the pseudogap in the underdoped region and its absence in the overdoped region . From Fig.it is also seen that SC is at its strongest at p ~ 0.186, as this remains the last point of SC at a critical Zn concentration (defined as the highest possible Zn concentration for which SC just survives considering all the possible doping states).

Even at fairly high hole concentration, (p ~ 0.180) \u03c1(T) is non-metallic over the whole experimental temperature range from 300K, indicating significant carrier localization induced by Zn in the CuO 2 plane and also due to some extrinsic effects like the degree of porosity of the sintered sample. The most striking feature of the \u03c1(T,p) data is the downturn in resistivity at around 230 \u00b1 5K, almost independent of planar hole concentration p.This downturn is somewhat masked for samples with higher oxygen deficiency (smaller p) due to the stronger non-metallic behavior over the whole temperature range.   These downturns in the \u03c1(T) data are similar to those observed in samples with a PG (see Figs.3). But in this sample it is unusual because (i) the PG-like feature is observed in resistivity for a heavily overdoped sample (T c = 12K, whereas T cmax ~ 27.9K for y = 0.06) and (ii) T * does not seem to change with p. The former indicates the possibility of disorder giving rise to this PG-like phenomenon, whereas the latter shows that in such a case, this feature is almost independent of planar hole content, p.In Fig.2b we have shown the p-independent T * for another heavily disordered compound (S2) from the \u03c1(T) measurements.  Although the nominal composition for S2 from a different batch was also y = 0.06 and x = 0.20, from the value of T cmax (= 32K) we think the actual Zn concentration in the CuO 2 plane is a little lower, probably ~ 5.5%.

We have found one source of published data where \u03c1(T) was measured over a wide range of p-values for samples with y = 0.07.  In that paper measurements were performed on high-quality c-axis oriented thin films of YBa 2 (Cu 1- y Zn y ) 3 O 7-\u03b4 .

From the reported 28 values of oxygen deficiencies for this film, we estimate the hole concentrations to be in the range p = 0.17 to 0.11 (within \u00b1 0.01).At this point it is important to notice that resistivity of this crystalline thin film is not affected by the presence of significant grain boundary resistance. This illustrates the role played by Zn as the principal source of disorder giving rise to the appearance of this PG-like feature in these samples. It also appears that T * in these heavily disordered samples is determined by the amount of Zn in the CuO 2 plane.  For example, we have T * = 205 \u00b1 5K, 230 \u00b1 5K, and 250 \u00b1 5K for samples with ~ 5.5%Zn, 6%Zn, and 7%Zn respectively. However, \u03c1(T) of 4%Zn substituted samples shows the usual T * (p) behavior as was found for the Zn-free samples (see Fig.3b).This indicates that the presence of a disorder induced PG temperature is a non-linear function of Zn concentration and, at least in the \u03c1(T) measurements, it reveals itself only in the highly disordered state.We discuss the possible implications and origins of this anomalous PG in the next section."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

First, the magnitude of the low-field ACS signal at low-T is largely reduced for the y > 0.05 samples and shows a strong p-dependence, namely the ACS signal reduces rapidly with the decrease of hole content in the UD side.   Both these features are absent for other samples for up to 5%Zn concentration (see Figs.5a and 5b). Second, the field dependent ACS signals as a function of temperature show the same qualitative features for both the sintered pellet and powder for S1 (see Figs.4c and 4d), showing the absence of any coupling T c and also the absence of any intergrain contribution to the shielding current.The reduction in the normalized ACS signal in powdered sample simply implies that grain size is further reduced due to grinding. The rapid reduction of the low-field ACS signal with increasing underdoping in S1 and S2 suggests that the superconducting volume fraction decreases rapidly with decreasing hole concentration.Whereas for a less disordered sample (Fig.5d), the field dependent ACS clearly shows the intergrain shielding component and the grain-coupling temperature (T coupling ) 29 ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This seems to agree with ACS data for up to 5%Zn substitution where the low-field bulk ACS signal showed little variation with Zn and the entire volume of the sample contributes to the ACS signal at low-temperature.   It is possible that for heavily Zn-substituted samples the effect is not local any more and some kind of phase segregation (between superconducting and non- superconducting regions) over a macroscopic length scale takes place.Alternatively, the superfluid density in these highly disordered samples can be extremely low .  At temperatures near T c , the temperature derivative of the ACS signal for the powdered samples can be used to estimate the zero- temperature superfluid density, n s0 . The temperature derivative of the ACS signal can be used to represent the quantity , where N is a constant depending on the shape of the grains, and a denotes the average grain size. In our calculations we have assumed N and a to be the same for all samples under consideration. This is a reasonable approximation because these compounds had nearly identical density and grinding of the pellets was done in exactly the same manner. We have calculated the fractional suppression in n s0 as a function of Zn content for 3%Zn and 6%Zn substituted samples with p = 0.20 \u00b1 0.005 (therefore, similarly heat treated). The results are as follows, for the 6%Zn sample is reduced to just 7% of its value for the Zn-free case at the same hole content. Whereas, n s0 /T c for the 3%Zn sample is reduced to 48% of its value for the Zn-free case.The above findings agree quite well with those obtained by Panagopoulos et al. from their London penetration depth measurements on magnetically aligned powders (grains)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Details of magneto-transport measurements can be found elsewhere . The field broadening of the resistive transition is shown in 6b for the 3%Zn substituted sintered and 2%Zn substituted thin film samples respectively.  The difference between the values of T c-onset at 0 Tesla and 12 Tesla is ~ (4.5 \u00b1 1)K (see Fig.6a) but the difference in T c defined at the zero resistivity under these two applied fields is ~ (18 \u00b1 1)K for the sintered sample. For the thin film with magnetic field parallel to the c-axis, these values are ~ (6 \u00b1 1)K and ~ (20 \u00b1 1)K respectively.  Such field broadening of the resistive transition is a general property for cuprates and one possible explanation is in terms of the unconventional vortex dynamics for these compounds 33 . Interestingly, the field broadening for the y = 0.06 sintered sample (S1) is insignificant even though the resistive transition itself is quite broad.For example, the difference between the values of T c-onset at 0 Tesla and 12 Tesla is (9.5 \u00b1 1)K and the difference in T c defined at the zero resistivity under these two applied fields is ~ (11 \u00b1 1) (Fig.6c), indicating almost complete absence of field broadening.   It is worth mentioning that such behavior is observed for conventional low-T c superconductors where the physics of flux pinning is dominated by quite different SC state parameters, e.g., \u03be is large and far less anisotropic, and T c itself is much lower. One possible reason for this small field broadening for the highly disordered sample could be due to the presence of unusually strong pinning in this compound.In fact, the ACS and the \u03c1(T) measurements on S1 and S2 lend support for this assumption.The bulk of this 6%Zn sample contains significant parts which are poorly conducting and can act as a source of strong vortex pinning similar to the intrinsic pinning observed in high-T c cuprates when flux-flow in the poorly conducting c-direction is greatly blocked by the poorly conducting charge reservoir layers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Ca x Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-\u03b4 is surprising considering the widely held belief that the energy scale of the PG is determined by p, and T * (p) either falls below or merges with the T c (p) line in the OD side.  In a previous magnetic susceptibility study, Cooper and Loram 34 observed a PG-like feature in fully oxygenated sintered 7%Zn-Y123, where superconductivity was almost completely suppressed with Zn.  Vobornik et al. also observed a pseudogap in ARPES experiments for disordered optimally doped Bi-2212 single crystals 35 .For Bi-2212, in-plane disorder was introduced by electron irradiation and T c was reduced from 90K to 62K.  \u03c1 ab (T) was also measured but no high-T downturn in resistivity for this 62K optimally doped Bi-2212 was found 35 .  In the light of present results, a possible reason might be that the sample was not \"sufficiently\" disordered, since we also did not see any anomalous effect in our 3%, 4%, and 5%Zn samples (where T c was suppressed by ~ 30K, ~ 40K, and ~ 46K respectively, near the optimum doping).  Notice that all the previous observations of disorder induced PG were for samples that are slightly OD and optimally doped respectively . Here we have reported this effect over a fairly wide doping range from p = 0.205 to 0.11.It is fair to say that there are two main effects of Zn substitution for Cu(2) in cuprates : (i) Zn tends to localize carriers in the CuO 2 plane (depending on temperature and Zn content) and (ii) it gives rise to \"Curie- like magnetic moments\" possibly on the four neighboring Cu sites (in the presence of short-range antiferromagnetically correlated background).  Recent 63 Cu NMR and inelastic neutron scattering studies suggest that Zn enhances the AF correlation in Y123. There is growing evidence that an AF background with short-range order does not exist in overdoped cuprates with p > 0.19 . The situation in highly disordered samples could be different, especially if there is phase segregation, and only a very weak form of superconductivity is present.  Under these circumstances Zn induced enhancement of short-range AF correlation might be a possibility for highly disordered Y 1-x Ca 1-x Ba 2 (Cu 1- y Zn y ) 3 O 7-\u03b4 irrespective of the hole content.It is very interesting to note that both the effects of Zn substitution (enhancement of short-range AF correlation or/and carrier localization in the CuO 2 plane) can be directly linked to the existence of the pseudogap.   AF fluctuation has been held widely responsible for (or at least partly contributing to) the formation of the PG by various theoretical and experimental studies .In another scenario, using the t-J model, strong Coulomb repulsion has been taken as responsible for both pseudogap and superconducting pairing . In the VHS scenario leads to localization of carriers and thus weakens the electrostatic screening, which, in turn effectively increases the Coulomb interaction.  As Zn plays a similar role on carrier transport in the CuO 2 planes, it can give rise to a pseudogap in the VHS scenario. It is hard to reconcile any precursor-pairing picture with this anomalous T * (p).On the other hand, scenarios in which the PG originates from correlations that are not related and compete with superconductivity, can possibly offer an explanation. In the competing correlations scenario T * (p) and T c (p) are detrimental to each other and the growth of one is accompanied by the decrease of the other (at least in the pure compounds). Kohno et al. 45 have in fact shown in their theoretical analysis that disorder can indeed strengthen one competing phase (AF) significantly over the other (e.g., superconductivity). The abrupt appearance of this anomalous PG-like feature in resistivity as a function of disorder content is indicative of some sort of threshold mechanism in action, consistent with some recent theoretical studies 5,46 . For example, in the study by Monthoux 5 it was shown that as quasiparticle life-time becomes shorter (with increasing scattering by spin fluctuations), it starts to \"feel\" long-range magnetic order even when only short-range correlations are present. The quasiparticle mean-free path relative to the correlation length of the short-range AF order determines the size of the pseudogap. As the quasiparticle life-time decreases with Zn, it is possible that at a certain level of Zn in the CuO 2 plane the scattering rate becomes high enough to dominate over the more gradual p-dependent scattering.  Using the Hubbard model, it was shown that a high scattering rate leads to the removal of low-energy spectral weight .In this scenario the local Coulomb repulsion, U, is the important parameter.Heavy Zn substitution increases the scattering rate, localizes quasiparticles and effectively enhances U/t (where t is the nearest-neighbor hopping energy) globally.Once U > 8t, the pseudogap becomes insensitive to U and therefore, should not show significant p- dependence .Roughly speaking, the mean distance between Zn impurities, l i , in the CuO 2 plane is given by ~ r/\u221az pl , where z pl = 3y/2 and r ~ 3.9\u00c5 is the distance between Cu atoms in the plane.For y = 0.06, l i ~ 13\u00c5, close to the value of the in-plane superconducting coherence length, This should imply that once the distance between Zn atoms becomes comparable with the superconducting coherence length, abrupt changes in the various normal and superconducting state properties take place."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The diamagnetic signal below the intra-grain superconducting transition temperature, T c , is extremely small due to a large penetration depth and may be masked by the huge diamagnetic shielding signal below the inter-grain phase-lock temperature, T p , which is about 10 K lower.  The assignment of the two transitions at T c and T p to intra- and inter-grain superconducting transitions, respectively, was recently proven in an investigation of the ac-susceptibility of sorted powders of RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 . The inter-grain diamagnetic signal systematically decreased with the particle size and completely disappeared for powders with an average particle size comparable to the grain size.   The intra-grain diamagnetic signal remains constant until the particle size becomes smaller than the grain dimension and before the signal decreases with further reduction in particle size.The possible existence of microdomains inside the grains has been suggested.

The essential feature of this structure is the presence of infi- nite Zr 6/2 X 3 chains of confacial antiprisms of metal Zr on which the shared edges are bridged by isolated p-element atoms (anions) X, as shown in figure 1. The octahedral interstitial sites at the center of these confacial chains have been the subject of many studies, especially on the stabili- zation of pseudo-binary and ternary compounds with the Mn 5 Si 3 structure. Superconductivity has been reported firstly in Zr 5 Sb 3 with T c \u223c2.3 K, and later in the Ru-doped Zr 5 Sb 3 and Hf 5 Sb 3 (with structure changing from Mn 5 Si 3 type to W 5 Si 3 type upon doping).   Recently, we have successfully induced superconductivity in the Ru-doped Zr 5 Ge 3 system, which remains the Mn 5 Si 3 type structure upon chemical doping, with a possible unconventional superconductivity signature. Surprisingly, the superconductivity induction is doping-site-selective.With the same Ru doping, super- conductivity only occurs with doping at the Ge site and remains absent with doping at the Zr site or an interstitial site above 1.8 K.  This indicates some other competing factors, other than charge carrier changes caused by doping, may also play an important role. In this paper, we have taken an alternative approach to examining this issue, and carried out systematic doping studies at different sites for the Zr 5 Ge 3 system. Chemical doping effects and structural instabilities caused by doping have been considered and tested for our doping studies in the Zr 5 Ge 3 system. Surprisingly, super- conductivity is only observed in the Pt doped Zr 5 Ge 3\u2212x Pt x system besides our previous report on Zr 5 Ge 3\u2212x Ru x samples.  We do not find superconductivity present in the same struc- ture for Pd, or Ir doping studies in a similar manner above 1.8 K.Furthermore, no superconductivity is observed for chemical doping (both hole and electron) at the Zr site, nor at the structural instability boundaries upon chemical doping in Zr 5 Ge 3 above 1.8 K.Our results suggest that Ge-Ru, and Ge-Pt are likely the critical charge-transfer pairs for the induced superconductivity, similar to the Sb-Ru pair reported in Zr 5 Sb 3\u2212x Ru x and Hf 5 Sb 3\u2212x Ru x compounds."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

One can clearly see that superconductivity is only observed in the Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5 sample, and the other samples with the same doping level remain as poor metals in the measured temperature range above 1.9 K.The decreased residual-resistance ratio (RRR) in all the doped samples is expected from the enhanced scattering at low temperature caused by chemical doping.  It is worthwhile to note that sometimes a small drop of resistivity is observed in the Ir- containing samples, which is attributed to small impurities of the superconducting Zr-Ir alloy that is not detectable from XRD, but is evidenced from later SEM analysis. Apparently, the Pt element, similar to Ru, is critical for the induced superconductivity in the Zr 5 Ge 3 system.  Similarly, the induced superconductivity through Pt doping is also found to be site-selective.As shown in (b), with the same amount of Pt doping, only the Ge site doped sample Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5 is superconducting at 2.8 K, and the samples doped at the Zr site Zr 4.5 Pt 0.5 Ge 3 and at the octahedral interstitial site Zr 5 Ge 3 Pt 0.5 are found to be non-super- conducting at our lowest measured temperature.These results further support our hypothesis that critical pairing of Ge-Ru and Ge-Pt is essential for the superconductivity in the Zr 5 Ge 3 compound, similar to the observation found in the Zr 5 Sb 3\u2212x Ru x and Hf 5 Sb 3\u2212x Ru x compounds."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

As the Y 5 Ge 3 compound also adopts the same Mn 5 Si 3 type structure, it should also be rather easy to form a solid solution for the doping studies. But for the Cr doping, the Cr 5 Ge 3 is crystallized in the tetragonal W 5 Si 3 structure, therefore one would expect structural transformation from the Mn 5 Si 3 type to the W 5 Si 3 type structure at certain doping levels if the doping studies are successful.

Since the average distance between CuO 2 planes is reduced due to the absence of the charge reservoir block, the interlayer coupling is expected to be very strong, which should strengthen the superconductivity. However, T c is only about 43 K, and neither the size of ionic radius, the magnetic moment, nor the concentration of Ln ions at Sr sites affects T c .   Moreover, the oxygen is very stoichiometric; neither vacancies nor interstitial oxygen exists.So far, the study of superconductivity in these compounds has been hindered by the lack of high quality bulk samples. However, in the case of infinite-layer superconducting films, superconducting transition temperature is much lower than those of bulk samples. For an infinite-layer superconducting film of (Sr 1\u2212x Nd x )CuO 2 , the T c is reduced by about one half.  High-pressure synthesis is a unique method that now allows infinite-layer compounds to be made in bulk form with various lanthanide ions doped into Sr sites with larger superconducting volume fractions.  In this paper, we report the high-pressure synthesis of the infinite-layer superconductor Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 (Sr(La)-112). To identify the superconductivity, we measured the low-field magnetization.The resulting superconducting volume fraction was found to be greatly improved compared to the results reported so far. The high purity of the samples was confirmed by a Rietveld analysis of the X-ray powder diffraction data.The high-field magnetization curves, along with the resulting irreversibility line showed, that the pinning was unusually high compared to that for hole doped cuprates."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This is quite typical for all of our samples. By measuring the point at which magnetic hysteresis curve M (H) deviates from linearity, we could identify the lower critical field H c1 , and our value was above 10 2 Oe, as are the values for other high-T c cuprates. Previously, it was claimed that H c1 was significantly less than 100 Oe. While the low-field magnetization demonstrated a highly enhanced superconducting volume fraction, the irreversible field H irr (T ) from the high-field magnetization up to 5 Tesla showed that pinning was very strong in this compound.  In , the magnetization curves for fields higher than 1 Tesla and the resulting H irr (T ) are presented. The criterion for the reversible point was set as |M zfc \u2212 M fc | = 0.1 emu/cm 3 .

It has been ar- gued that there are at least two effects determining the total pressure dependence of T c , an intrinsic effect and the one that arises from the pressure-induced changes in the charge carrier concentration. However, there are ef- fects which make the discrimination between these contri- butions difficult. In most HTS the application of pressure doesn't simply compress the lattice, but also prompts mobile oxygen defects to assume a greater degree of lo- cal order. This leads to relaxation effects which are both temperature and pressure dependent. An exception is the double-chain compound YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 with a fixed oxygen stoichiometry.  Bucher et al. found that in this com- pound T c increases under hydrostatic pressure with the rate dT c /dp \u2243 5.5 K/GPa.Subsequent studies revealed that with increasing pressure T c passes through a maxi- mum around 9 GPa and then decreases.  Furthermore, measurements of the in-plane penetration depth \u03bb ab of YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 revealed pressure induced changes which cannot be simply attributed to the pressure changes of T c .  Since in cuprate high-temperature superconduc- tors, including YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 , the critical regime where thermal critical fluctuations dominate is experimentally accessible, various critical properties are not independent but related by universal realtions.  Ac- cordingly, the isotope or pressure effects on these quanti- ties are related as well.Here we explore the universal relationship between the pressure effects on transition temperature T c , volume V and anisotropy \u03b3 emerging from the pressure induced changes of the magnetization near T c .It is shown that in the underdoped YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 the pressure effect on T c mirrors essentially that on the anisotropy.This uncovers a novel generic property of anisotropic type II superconductors, inexistent in the isotropic case."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Indeed the relative volume change is an order of magnitude smaller. Furthermore, from Fig. , showing \u2206T c /T c and \u2206\u03b3/\u03b3 versus p for the estimates listed in Table , it is seen that in the pressure range considered here, both \u2206T c /T c and \u2206\u03b3/\u03b3 depend nearly linearly on pressure. Thus, under pressure not only T c and the volume changes but the anisotropy is modified as well.  A quick glance to Table I reveal that the pressure effect on T c mirrors essentially that on the anisotropy. In addition, recent in-plane penetration depth \u03bb ab mea- surements revealed that there is a pressure effect on this important property also. It was shown that the in-plane penetration depth data of YBa 2 Cu 2 O 8 is consistent with 3D-XY critical behavior, where the penetration depth and correlation length in direction i diverge near T c as \u03bb 2 i (T ) = \u03bb 2 i0 t \u2212\u03bd and \u03be i (T ) = \u03be i0 t \u2212\u03bd with t = 1 \u2212 T /T c and \u03bd \u2243 2/3.  Moreover, as listed in Table , the critical amplitude \u03bb \u22122 ab0 was found to be pressure dependent. The consistency with 3D-XY critical behavior implies that the transition temperature T c and the critical amplitudes of the in-plane penetration depths \u03bb ab0 and the c-axis correlation lengths \u03be c0 are not independent but related by Universality implies that this relation holds irrespective of the applied pressure.Thus, in addition to Eq.(6) the pressure induced relative changes are then related by and, because of \u03b3 = \u03be ab0 /\u03be c0 , Using then the estimates for \u2206T c /T c and \u22122\u2206\u03bb ab0 /\u03bb ab0 the relative change \u2206\u03be c0 /\u03be c0 is readily calculated with aid of Eq. , while the values for \u2206\u03be ab0 /\u03be ab0 follow from relation .

The relative change of the transition temperature \u2206T c /T c is seen to mirror essentially that of the anisotropy \u2206\u03b3/\u03b3. This is consis- tent with the generic behavior for high-temperature su- perconductors, where for a given HTS family T c increases with reduced aniostropy.

Indeed, the magnitude and sign of dT c /dp may indicate a way to rise T c at ambient pressure, and moreover, help to understand the superconducting pairing mechanism.So far, all these studies show that T c decreases with increasing pressure, with a rate depend- ing on the method and the pressure medium used.  The first hydrostatic measurement of T c (p) up to 0.7 GPa, re- veals that T c decreases reversibly under hydrostatic pres- sure at the rate dT c /dp = \u2212 1.11(2) K/GPa. The be- havior of T c (p) with pressure in MgB 2 was attributed to the pressure induced lattice stiffening (increase of the phonon frequency), 5,6 rather than to the decrease in the electronic density of states N(E F ), that is only moder- ately affected by pressure.  Comparison with theoreti- cal calculations supported the view that MgB 2 is a BCS superconductor with moderately strong electron-phonon coupling. Apart from T c , an other relevant superconducting pa- rameter is the magnetic field penetration depth \u03bb.  In fact the so-called superfluid density \u03bb \u22122 is related to the Fermi velocity and to the density of charge carri- ers, and its temperature dependence gives information on the symmetry and on the magnitude of the supercon- ducting gap.A study of pressure effects on \u03bb \u22122 (0) can give important informations on how the electronic de- grees of freedom are affected by lattice modifications and on the nature of the electron-phonon coupling.   Indeed, in cuprates high temperature superconductors (HTS), a huge pressure effect on \u03bb \u22122 (0) was found, in particu- lar in YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 (Y124). Part of this effect was at- tributed to the strong renormalization of the Fermi ve- locity, and therefore to the effective mass, due to the non- adiabatic coupling of the electrons to the lattice. This result is in agreement with the substantial oxygen iso- tope effect found in cuprates and can be in- terpreted in the framework of non-adiabatic theory of superconductivity. 14 In this paper we report measurements of the mag- netic penetration depth under pressure in polycrystalline MgB 2 .The temperature dependence of \u03bb \u22122 (T ) was ex- tracted from the Meissner fraction f measured in a low magnetic field.A small pressure (p) effect on \u03bb \u22122 (0) was found [ \u2206\u03bb \u22122 \u03bb \u22122 = 1.5(9)%], for pressure ranging from 0.15 to 1.13 GPa.Theoretical calculations of the pressure ef- fect on \u03bb(0) confirm the smallness of this effect [ \u2206\u03bb \u22122 \u03bb \u22122 \u2243 1.4%].These results contrast with the huge effect (\u223c 40 %) on \u03bb \u22122 (0) found in the non-adiabatic cuprate super- conductor Y124 in the same range of pressure 8 ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The hydrostatic pressure was produced in a copper-beryllium piston cylinder clamp, especially de- signed for magnetization measurements under pressure (see Ref ). The sample was put in a teflon cylin- der and the pressure cell was then filled with Fluorinert FC77 as pressure transmitting medium. The Meissner fraction was calculated from low field magnetization mea- surements (field cooling) performed with a commercial Superconducting Quantum Interference Device.  In the approximation of spherical grains with average radius R, the Meissner fraction can be related to the magnetic pen- etration depth via the Shoenberg formula: 16 (1) Any change in \u03c7/\u03c7 0 due to pressure can be attributed mainly to a change of \u03bb(T ), rather than to a change of R, which is practically pressure independent. The sam- ple was measured at low pressure p L = 0.15 GPa and at the highest pressure available p H = 1.13 GPa. The pres- sure values were determined from a preliminary calibra- tion measurement, where the same sample was measured in the pressure cell together with a small piece of lead. The pressure was detected by measuring the T c shift of lead (T c (0kbar)=7.2K).   We found dT c /dp = \u2212 1.24(5) K/GPa, in good agreement with previous results.The real zero-pressure measurement could not be performed in the pressure cell, since, in order to seal the cell, at least a small pressure had to be applied. In the temperature dependence of the normal- ized magnetization of MgB 2 at p L and p H is shown in the vicinity of T c , together with the zero pressure p Z measurement performed on the same sample in a quartz tube. The T c's were obtained from the intercept of the linear extrapolations (see The magne- tization curves shift systematically with increasing pres- sure towards lower temperature.

This result shows that only a very small pressure effect on \u03bb \u22122 is present. The pressure results are summarized in To determine the pressure effect on the zero tempera- ture \u03bb \u22122 (0), a fit to the experimental data is needed. It was well established that MgB 2 is a two band supercon- ductor with two superconducting gaps of different size, the larger one originating from the 2D \u03c3-band and the smaller one from the 3D \u03c0-band . Taking this into account, the temperature dependence of \u03bb, in the low temperature range, can be written in the form : Here, \u2206 1 and \u2206 2 are the zero temperature small and large gap associated to the \u03c0 and \u03c3 bands, respectively, and w = \u03bb \u22122 1 (0)/\u03bb \u22122 (0). The zero pressure data were then fitted to Eq. 3 up to 22 K. The fit gave the following results: \u03bb \u22122 (0) = 91.1(2) \u00b5 m \u22122 , w = 0.22(3); \u2206 1 = 2.3(2) meV, \u2206 2 = 7.4(4) meV.

In we added also the ratio 2\u2206/k B T c calculated for \u2206 1 and \u2206 2 at each pressure. This ratio results to be pressure independent within errors. Considering that p H \u2212 p L \u2243 1 GPa, Eq. (4) indi- cates that d ln \u03bb \u22122 (0)/dp is of the order of few %/GPa. Since \u03bb \u22122 (0) is proportional to the squared plasma fre- quency, \u03c9 2 p , then a free electron gas estimate would give d ln \u03bb \u22122 (0)/dp = 1/B \u2243 0.65%/GPa, where we have used \u03c9 2 p \u221d 1/\u2126, being B = \u2212dp/d ln \u2126 \u2243 155 GPa the bulk modulus of MgB 2 , and \u2126 the volume of the unit cell.  As we show below, an improved estimate which takes into ac- count MgB 2 band structure effects does not change much the free electron gas result. Let us consider the zero tem- perature expression of the penetration depth: 25 where the integral runs over the Fermi surface S n F of the n-th band (n = \u03c3, \u03c0) and v n (s) is the correspond- ing surface bare electron velocity vector. Let us use the model of Ref. where the \u03c0 bands are modeled by a half-torus Fermi surface of area S 1 and Fermi velocity v 1 , while the \u03c3 bands are approximated by a cylindrical Fermi surface of area S 2 and Fermi velocity v 2 . Equation (5) then reduces simply to \u03bb \u22122 (0) = \u03bb \u22122 where w = \u03bb \u22122 is the parameter introduced in Eq.(3). Within the same ap- proximations, the electron density of states at the Fermi level reads N F = N 1 + N 2 , where N i \u221d \u2126S i /v i is the partial density of states for the band i = 1, 2. Therefore, since \u03bb \u22122 i (0) \u221d S i v i \u221d \u2126S 2 i /N i , and considering that S 1 and S 2 scale as \u2126 \u22122/3 , Eq.(6) reduces to: where we have introduced the parameter \u03b7 = (d ln N 1 /dp)/(d ln N 2 /dp) whose calculated value ranges between \u03b7 \u2243 1, 27 and \u03b7 \u2243 0.

It is then natural to consider the electron-phonon inter- action \u03bb el\u2212ph . The pressure effect on \u03bb el\u2212ph in MgB 2 is mainly due to a pressure induced hardening of the optical phonon modes.

Arguments are used there to deduce that part (\u223c 30%) of this large effect is due to the pressure dependence of the Fermi velocity, because of the non-adiabatic electron- lattice coupling. From the results of the present work, we can therefore argue that such non-adiabatic effects on \u03bb(0) \u22122 are negligible in MgB 2 , as previously demon- strated by \u00b5SR measurements.

Since the single crystals were very thin along the c axis, the thickness was measured with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The actual compositions were measured through inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. The x-ray diffraction pattern showed no trace of impurities, and the c-axis lattice parameter for x=0 was evaluated to be 30.85\u00c5, which agrees with the value in the literature .  The measured compositions, sizes, and c-axis lattice parameters are listed in table 1. We should note that crystals grown by a flux method are produced with little stress, owing to the slow cooling rate near thermal equilibrium. In fact, we did not observe any serious cracks in the SEM images of our samples.

We therefore propose that holes are confined in a CuO 2 plane in the presence of the 2D spin fluctuation, which occurs irrespective of doping levels. As the 3D AF order grows below T N , the confinement becomes less effective. A recent numerical analysis of the bilayer t \u2212 J model has also led to the assertion that \u03c1 c is substantially modified in the presence of the 2D spin fluctuation .

For 100 K < T < 250 K, this compound is in a 2D ferromagnetic state, and exhibits a non-metallic \u03c1 c together with a metallic \u03c1 ab . Once the 3D ferromagnetic order appears below 100 K, \u03c1 c becomes metallic to behave in a 3D-like manner.

We note that the actual oxygen content of the obtained NdFeAsO 1-y compounds estimated by neutron diffraction analysis was larger than the intended values probably due to oxidation of the NdAs and Fe powders.  Oxidation of the sample during synthesis process such as the weighing, mixing also may cause as the source of oxygen gain.

The temper- ature dependence \u03bb(T ) reflects the quasiparticle density of states available for thermal excitations and therefore probes the superconducting gap structure. The shape of \u03bb(T ) and the zero-temperature value \u03bb(0) provide infor- mation about the superconducting mechanism and set a length scale for the screening of an external magnetic field. In addition, the field dependence of \u03bb at low tem- peratures may reflect the anisotropy of the superconduct- ing energy gap. In this paper, we report on magnetic field penetration depth measurements down to 30 mK in RbOs 2 O 6 by means of the transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF-\u00b5SR) technique (see e.g. ). The temper- ature dependence of \u03bb \u22122 saturates at low temperatures and becomes constant below T \u2243 0.2T c . This behav- ior agrees with what is expected for weak-coupled s-wave BCS superconductors. Measurements of the magnetic field dependence of \u03bb by means of TF-\u00b5SR and mag- netization reveal that at low temperatures \u03bb is almost field independent.  This result suggests that the super- conducting energy gap in RbOs 2 O 6 is isotropic.

For this reason H c2 (T ) was extracted from the M F C (T ) curves measured in con- stant magnetic fields ranging from 0.5 mT to 6 T (see Fig. ). For each particular field H the corresponding T c (H) was taken as the temperature where H = H c2 (T = T c ) (see inset in Fig. ). H c2 depends almost linearly on T with some sign of saturation below 2.5 K. Note that a lin- ear H c2 (T ) behavior was also observed in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 and recently in RbOs 2 O 6 , and in KOs 2 O 6 4 pyrochlore superconductors.   In the conventional BCS picture, H c2 is linear in T near T c0 [T c0 = T c (H = 0)] and saturates by approaching 0 K.The absolute value of H c2 (0) can be obtained by using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula proposed for a weak-coupling super- conductor: H c2 (0) = 0.693(\u2212dH c2 /dT )| T =Tc0 . The linear fit in the vicinity of T c0 yields d\u00b5 0 H c2 /dT = \u22121.37(4) T/K and T c0 = 6.32(19) K. The correspond- ing value of \u00b5 0 H WHH c2 (0) was found to be 6.00T.  The dashed line in is the theoretical H c2 (T ) curve obtained from the WHH model in the orbital limit. 5 At high temperatures (above \u22433.5 K) the WHH line agrees rather well with the experimental data.How- ever, at lower temperatures the experimental points no longer follow the WHH curve, suggesting that the ac- tual value of H c2 (0) is slightly larger than H WHH c2 (0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

However, at high and at low temperatures the data sys- tematically deviate from the simple BCS line, suggesting that the ratio 2\u2206 0 /k B T c is field dependent as demon- started in . It is worth noting that for conventional bulk superconductors the ratio 2\u2206 0 /k B T c is field inde- pendent, while in thin films and in granular materials the dependence is quite strong. For the thin films of Sn, Pb and In 37,38 it was experimentally observed that at the low temperatures the magnetic field dependence of the BCS ratio follows the empirical relation: where 2\u2206 0 (0)/k B T c (0) is the BCS ratio at zero field.

III B).  The field dependence of the energy gap may be explained if one assumes that the elec- trons moving close to the surface contribute less to the pairing energy.This may result to the decrease of the energy gap with increasing the magnetic field. To summarize, the ratio 2\u2206 0 /k B T c is found in the range of 3.09-3.98 close to the weak-coupling BCS value 3.52.

The ratio 2\u2206 0 /k B T c was found to be in the range of 3.09-3.98 close to the weak-coupling BCS value 3.52. (v) The \u00b5SR and the equilibrium magnetization measurements both show that at low temperatures the magnetic pene- tration depth \u03bb is almost (within the accuracy of 10%) field independent, in agreement with what is expected for a superconductor with an isotropic energy gap.

In classical type-II superconductors this quantity has been unequivocally de- termined from the magnetotransport measurement and its temperature dependence can, in most cases, be well described by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory .  However, for the high-T c superconductors, H c2 extracted from magnetotransport data reveals an un- usual increase with decreasing temperatures without any saturation down to low temperatures. This upward cur- vature is observed in a pronounced way in the supercon- ducting cuprates Sm 2\u2212x Ce x CuO 4 , Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+\u03b4 , Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO y , and YBa 2 (Cu 1\u2212x Zn x )O 7\u2212\u03b4 . How- ever, the effect is also found in the fully three dimensional and non magnetic Ba 1\u2212x K x BiO 3 .    Among others, a bipolaron scenario , an unconventional normal state , a strong electron-phonon coupling , the presence of inhomogeneities and magnetic impurities have been put forward for an explanation of the anomalous H c2 (T ) dependence.Because depinned vortices, either in the liq- uid or solid state, cause a finite dissipative resistance be- fore reaching the full transition to the normal state, the complexity of the H \u2212 T phase diagram in high-T c 's undermines any direct determination of the upper critical field from magnetotransport data.There are indications that, also in the fully 3D system of Ba 1\u2212x K x BiO 3, fluc- tuations can lead to a melting of the vortex-glass state .This could be a reason complicating a determination of H c2 from a dissipative measurement as magnetoresis- tance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

A linear dependence of dI/dV (0) as a function of applied field can be found in a limited field range. At the highest fields a \"tailing\" of the zero-bias conductance towards the normal-state value is observed, and a finite value of the zero-bias conductance is found already at zero magnetic field. The latter effect is ob- viously due to the \u0393 broadening. Also the tailing effect at the highest fields could be related to the same cause as the \u0393 broadening, i.e. a certain inhomogeneity in the sample. The observed tailing effect resembles the behav- ior in the resistive transition close to the transition into the normal state (see ). A linear extrapolation of the zero-bias conductance to the field where the normalized conductance equals unity, as shown by the full lines in , has been used to determine the upper critical field. shows the obtained temperature dependence of the upper critical field H t c2 (T ). Also the points H * (T ) obtained from 90 % of the magnetoresistance transition (R/R n = 0.9) are indicated. The slope of H t c2 (T ) near T c is different from that of the transition field H * (T ) deter- mined from resistance data.  We note that the tunneling critical fields H t c2 (T ) are at fields where the bulk resis- tivity is very close to the onset of superconductivity (as indicated by the arrows for H t c2 in ). As a very significant result, H t c2 (T ) shows a clear sat- uration at the lowest temperatures as expected for the WHH theory.

Their measurements of the electric field versus current density E \u2212 J show that a second order phase transi- tion from a vortex glass to a vortex liquid state does exist in this system. The presence of the liquid phase can induce strong fluctuations below H c2 related to the motion of the flux lines, but these fluctuations can be quite small above H c2 . This can be the reason why H c2 (see arrows in is quite close to the onset of the resistive transitions .

In the x=0.65 sample, this is true above T =200 K, while below this temperature 1/T 1 T starts to decrease, leaving a broad peak at around T * =200 K.  This is a typical pseudogap behavior seen in this NMR quantity . Our observation of the pseudogap in this single- layered cuprate system is consistent with that made by the ARPES measurement for a x=0.35 sample .  In- terestingly, the pseudogap persists even in the x=0.15 sample which is in the overdoped regime, although with a reduced T * =60 K.Such a low T * has not so far been possible to access, since it is below T c in most materials."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The result that the magnitude of 1/T 1 T for x \u22640.15 is enhanced over that for x \u22650.25 is probably due to the increase of the transferred hyperfine coupling constant which has previously been reported in the heavily overdoped regime . shows the magnetic field dependence of 1/T 1 T for x=0.40 under H=0, 28.5 T and 43 T.

This suggests that superconductivity and pseudo- gap are coexisting matters. Below T * , some parts of the Fermi surface are lost due to the onset of the pseudogap, but other parts of the Fermi surface remain ungapped. If one roughly estimates the DOS from T 1 T * /T 1 T , then about 2/3 of the Fermi surface is gapped at T = T c in the case of Bi 2 Sr 1.6 La 0.4 CuO 6+\u03b4 , but 1/3 remains un- gapped.  Only below T c , the remaining Fermi surface is gapped as well due to the onset of superconductivity.  Our conclusion that the PG and superconductivity are coex- isting matters is also supported by the lack of correlation between T * and T c .In the present system, the tempera- ture scale of T * is the same as that for samples with T c of \u223c100 K , even though T c of the present system is much lower. The existence of a critical carrier concentration for the pseudogap, the lack of scaling or correlation between T c and T * , and the persistence of the pseudogap when superconductivity is removed seem not to favor super- conducting precursor as a candidate responsible for the pseudogap which was proposed theoretically by several authors."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The low-T normal state of the samples with x \u22640.40 (T c = 8 \u223c32 K) has been accessed by suppressing superconductivity completely with the strong magnetic fields. It has been found that there exists a critical doping concentration at which the pseudogap state terminates.   The critical concentration is p cr \u223c0.21 (x \u223c0.05), which is deep in- side the overdoped region.Beyond p cr , the normal state down to T =2 K when the superconductivity is removed is a Fermi liquid state as evidenced by the T 1 T =const re- lation. Comparison of the low-T normal state where su- perconductivity is suppressed with the superconducting state suggests that superconductivity and the pseudogap coexist. This is also supported by the lack of correla- tion between T * and T c.These results that characterize microscopically, for the first time, the zero-T -limit nor- mal state of the copper-oxide superconductors, should pose a constraint on theories for the high-T c supercon- ductivity and may also provide clues for understanding other strongly correlated electron systems such as heavy fermion materials."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The phase diagram exhibits several structural phases (LTO1, LTO2, and LTT) as a function of temperature at ambient and low pressures, but with increasing pressure first the LTT phase is eliminated, and above 4.0 GPa only the HTT phase is observed.  In the La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 system it is known [2-4] that the LTT and the LTO2 phases strongly suppress superconductivity, leading to anomalously low ambient pressure T c values.According to the structural phase diagram in Figure 6 (top), as the applied pressure is increased from ambient to above 4.0 GPa, the LTT and LTO2 phases vanish and the T c should increase by as much as an order of magnitude.   In (bottom) we show the results of two consecutive high-pressure measurement series on La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 to pressures as high as 19 GPa. To experimental accuracy, T c (P) is identical for both experiments and is seen to be reversible in pressure over the entire pressure range.For the second experiment (unprimed numbers) it is interesting to note that, as the pressure is released below 6 GPa, the superconducting transition broadens markedly.This may signal that the sample has entered a multiphase region as the HTT phase converts to the LTO2 and LTT phases."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The maximum value of T c (P) for La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 is approximately 22 K at 5 GPa for the HTT phase, whereas for a La 1.88 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 polycrystalline sample T c \u2248 30 K for the LTO1 phase at ambient pressure [2].The lower maximum T c for La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 may be an effect of the increased disorder 10 associated with Nd substitution, although a similar maximum value of T c has also been observed [11-13] for La 1.875 Ba 0.125 CuO 4 under hydrostatic pressure.Another possibility is the presence of residual charge order in La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 in the HTT phase (see discussion below)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The results of that study were interpreted to show that a hydrostatic pressure of 0.2 GPa is sufficient to stabilize the HTT phase in La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . Our structural and T c measurements, however, consistently find that a much higher pressure of 4.2 GPa is required to stabilize the HTT structure in this material. One plausible origin for this large discrepancy is the much greater sensitivity of resistivity measurements to the T c values in minority regions such as crystallographic twin boundaries, which may contain LTO2, LTO1 or HTT phases [23] with higher T c values than the bulk phase.   A second possibility is that the pressure in that study was not fully hydrostatic, yielding an exceptionally rapid increase of T c . A similar rapid rise of T c has been reported for LTT La 1.64 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.16 CuO 4 under uniaxial pressure applied parallel to the (110) axis [15]: a pressure of only 0.3 GPa increased T c from T c = 10 K to ~17 K.A linear extrapolation of the data in reference [15] suggests that a uniaxial pressure of ~0.5 GPa along the (110) direction would increase T c to 22 K, the value we observe under a hydrostatic pressure of 5.0 GPa.If the uniaxial pressure suppresses the LTT phase in favor of the HTT phase, then the data in reference [15] suggest that a uniaxial pressure of only 0.5 GPa in the (110) direction is sufficient to accomplish this structural transformation! Structural 11 measurements under uniaxial compression using single crystal x-ray or neutron diffraction are necessary to test this possibility."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

This conclusion is consistent with results for La 1.88 Ba 0.12 CuO 4 [4, 11], as well as with other observations that suggest the highest superconducting transition temperatures occur when the Cu-O planes in lanthanum cuprates are flat, that is there are no tilt distortions [24]. Within the stripe scenario, the HTT structure has no pinning potential in the Cu-O planes to lead to charge ordering and consequent suppression of superconductivity.   In addition, there is no Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction in the HTT phase, and the interlayer magnetic exchange is fully frustrated.Thus the HTT structure should provide the most homogeneous and magnetically isotropic environment of the four tilt structures listed in Table I.Very recent experimental work using scanning tunneling microscopy has highlighted the presence of charge ordering with (4a x 4a) or (4.5a x 4.5a) periodicities in the underdoped cuprates Na x Ca 2-x CuO 2 Cl 2 [6] and Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+\u03b4, respectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

If so, this would provide indirect evidence for residual charge order in the HTT phase of La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . This type of data has been presented [13] for La 2- x Ba x CuO 4 , and does show a local minimum of T c at x = 1/8.Unfortunately, high-pressure structural data were not presented in that work, nor were the superconducting T c s measured to pressures high enough to observe a clear maximum value of T c (as we see for La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 in ).    Thus we believe it is not safe to conclude at this time that there is a local minimum of T c in the HTT phase of La 2-x Ba x CuO 4 , or any other lanthanum cuprates, when x = 1/8.  Clarifying this issue is, however, an important goal for future high-pressure experiments. In addition, it would be very interesting to directly observe, by neutron or x-ray scattering, the charge-ordered state in these materials as a function of pressure.Such measurements will be difficult, however, because the charge- order superlattice peaks are weak in the LTT phase , and must be detected in the presence of the background scattering from the diamond anvil or other type of pressure cell.It is also well-known that La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 at ambient pressure shows a local minimum of T c at x = 1/8 , suggesting that some charge and spin order exists in the LTO1 phase of this material as well.In fact, incommensurate elastic magnetic peaks have been reported in neutron-scattering measurements for La 1.88 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 , although no direct evidence yet exists for charge order.In total, these results reinforce the unique nature of the electronic state at x = 1/8 in the lanthanum cuprates, and the strong coupling of this state to the structural distortions, although we still lack a complete understanding of these phenomena."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In these researches, one of interests is in the relationship between superconducting transition temperature (T c ) and crys- tal structure.  Lee et al. have found the relationship be- tween T c and the bond angle of As-Fe-As, and suggested that the formation of a regular FeAs 4 tetrahedron is im- portant for higher T c . 1) Meanwhile, Kuroki et al. have theoretically suggested that the pnictogen height from the Fe plane (h P n ) and lattice constant are good param- eters to control T c . 2) They pointed out that the nest- ing properties of Fermi surfaces are sensitive to h P n and, that the reduction in lattice constant suppresses superconductivity through the enhancement of the hop- ping between orbitals, and explained the difference in T c among some \"1111\" systems such as LaFeAs(O 1\u2212x ,F x ), NdFeAsO 1\u2212y , LaFePO, and NdFeAsO 1\u2212y under pres- sure. FeSe (\"11\" system) was also found to show a close relationship between T c and crystal structure, especially h P n .     The T c of FeSe, which is 8 K at ambient pressure, increases markedly under pressure, accompanied by a decrease in h P n .The pressure dependence of T c ex- hibits a plateau at approximately 1 GPa. 7) h P n shows a similar pressure dependence to T c , and reproduces the plateau, while the bond angle of Se-Fe-Se is almost un- changed under pressure. 4) NMR studies of FeSe have re- vealed that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations develop under pressure associated with the increase in T c .Results of these studies support that h P n is a key fac- tor for adjusting the nesting properties and T c .Between LaFePO (h P n = 1.12\u00c5) and NdFeAsO 1\u2212y (h P n = 1.38 A), T c increases with increasing h P n , while the T c of FeSe increases with decreasing h P n (h P n = 1.45 \u2192 1.42 A).This suggests that an optimum h P n exists at ap- proximately h P n of NdFeAsO 1\u2212y."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The relationship between T c and h P n is seen at ambient pressure. implies that the h P n of NdFeAsO 1\u2212y is optimum for a high T c . Kuroki et al., have suggested that lattice constant also affects superconductivity, and its reduction lowers T c .    Lattice constant, which always decreases under pressure, can- not be a factor for the increase in T c under pressure.Here, we take notice of h P n and its change under pres- sure while considering that an optimum h P n exists. Note that Kuroki et al. did not mention that an optimum h P n exists.The structural parameters under pressure for FeSe, NdFeAsO 1\u2212y , and LiFeAs have already been in- vestigated.  In NdFeAsO 1\u2212y , h P n slightly decreases from 1.34 to 1.33\u00c5 under pressure. Note that this h P n at ambient pressure differs from that (1.38\u00c5) reported by Lee et al.   The decrease in h P n and the reduction in lattice constant are considered to suppress superconduc- tivity under pressure in NdFeAsO 1\u2212y . 2) If we consider that the h P n = 1.34 \u2212 1.38\u00c5 of NdFeAsO 1\u2212y is the op- timum range for a high T c , the h P n of FeSe approaches it under pressure, and T c increases. In contrast, the h P n of LiFeAs deviates from the optimum range, and T c de- creases. In the case of LiFeAs, a FeAs 4 tetrahedron also deviates from the regular one under pressure.The change in h P n is likely the main factor in deciding the change in T c under pressure in NdFeAsO 1\u2212y , FeSe, and LiFeAs. In this context, if the h P n in \"21113\" systems decreases under high pressures, the increase in T c under pressure for Sr 2 VFeAsO 3 is reasonable because the h P n is high at ambient pressure.Interestingly, the T c and h P n of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3 are comparable to those of FeSe under pressure.On the other hand, the decrease in T c under pressure for Sr 2 ScFePO 3 is also reasonable because the h P n at ambient pressure is already low."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The compound appears to be the first superconducting layered metal oxide involving 3d-transition metals other than copper. The de-intercalation of Na + ions accompanied by an intercalation of water molecules results in a combined doping and c-axis expansion effect effectively reducing the interlayer coupling between the CoO 2 planes and enhancing the two-dimensional character of the structure.  Magnetic susceptibility mea- surements have shown a diamagnetic drop below 5 K ascribed to the onset of superconduc- tivity although the estimated volume fraction is only of the order of 10% of the value for perfect diamagnetism.The high-field dependence of the susceptibility resembles that of the high-T c copper oxides, with little change of the onset but an appreciable broadening of the superconducting transition under increasing magnetic field.  Because of these similarities and the fact that the removal of water suppresses the superconductivity it was suggested that the large separation of the CoO 2 layers and the reduced interaction between them is essential for stabilizing the superconducting state.  The major difference to the square CuO 2 planes of the cuprates is the triangular symmetry of the Co-lattice that may lead to possible frustration effects in the magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetically interacting cobalt spins.Theoretical treatments therefore employ the t-J model on a planar triangular lattice. Different magnetic and superconducting orders, e.g. d-wave superconductivity, 2 a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking d x 2 \u2212y 2 + id xy ground state, and spin triplet superconductivity 4 have been proposed.  To distinguish between different theoretical proposals and to facilitate our basic understanding of superconductivity in Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O far more experimental work needs to be conducted. In particular, the dependence of the superconducting state on the interlayer coupling is of interest. The CoO 2 interlayer coupling should be tuned reversibly by changing the distance between the planes (c-axis lattice parameter) without affecting the chemical composition, i.e. the content of sodium and water.This can be achieved by applying hydrostatic pressure.Because of the strong lattice anisotropy and the weak bonding between the layers (the water molecules are electrically neutral although polarized) it is expected that the compression of the c-axis increases the interlayer coupling and has a major effect on the superconductivity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The superconducting transition is well resolved and the onset of diamagnetism causes the decrease of the inductance signal below T c . The vertical drop of I(T) close to 7 K in Fig. indicates the diamagnetic signal from the superconducting transition of the lead manometer and it was used for pressure determination.  With increasing pressure the superconducting transition of the Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O powder shifts to lower temperature and the transition becomes slightly sharper. It is remarkable that the shape and the overall drop of the susceptibility curves do not change appreciably with pressure which indicates that the sample is stable at the applied hydrostatic pressure.  There is no sign of a possible chemical decomposition or loss of water during the experiments. After acquiring the highest pressure data the pressure was almost completely released (a residual pressure of 0.04 GPa was measured) and the susceptibility curve was found in good agreement with the ambient pressure data taken at the start of the experiments.These data are marked by filled squares in Fig. .  This again shows that the sample is stable and the superconducting properties are reversible under hydrostatic pressure. The T c (p) as estimated from the onset of the diamagnetic signal (see inset of Fig. ) is displayed in Fig. . For low pressure the change of T c is relatively small. With increasing pressure the T c decreases faster resulting in a non linear dependence T c (p) as shown in Fig. The solid line is a fit of the data to a parabolic pressure dependence, T c (p) = 4.68 \u2212 0.0047 p \u2212 0.183 p 2 (T c in K and p in GPa).  At the highest pressure of this experiment (1.53 GPa) the superconducting transition dropped to 4.2 K.Extrapolating the parabolic dependence to T c =0 yields a critical pressure of p c \u2243 5 GPa.  The recovery of the T c after pressure release is indicated by the filled square in Fig. 2 (in contrast to the open circles denoting data estimated within the increasing pressure cycle).  It should be noted that in the present experiments the pressure medium was frozen at the superconducting transition temperature.  This may result in deviations from pure hydrostatic conditions and small pressure gradients throughout the sample space could be expected.  Any pressure medium, even He gas at elevated pressure, will solidify at these low temperatures.In order to check on possible pressure gradients we have evaluated the width of the diamagnetic drop of the ac susceptibility in passing the superconducting transition of the lead manometer.The cooling speed was electronically controlled as low as 0.01 K/min.The width of the lead transition (as measured between the 90% and 10% drop of the susceptibility) was even at the highest pressure still below 0.01 K and only slightly larger than the zero pressure value of 0.008 K.If the small difference is attributed to a pressure gradient across the volume of the lead sample the inhomogeneity is less than 0.005 GPa at the maximum pressure of 1.6 GPa.With the Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O samples linear dimension being about 10 times the size of the lead the possible pressure gradients are still small and should not affect the results significantly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In low-T c (i.e. BCS-like, phonon-mediated) superconductivity the negative pressure shift of T c can be explained by a decrease of the electron-phonon coupling constant, \u03bb. \u03bb is proportional to the electronic density of states (DOS) and to the inverse of the average square of the phonon frequency. The application of pressure usually results in an increase of the phonon frequency (phonon \"hardening\" effect) and, in many instances, in a decrease of the DOS. Both effects lead to a decrease of T c , as was recently discussed, for example, in MgB 2 .  The high-T c cuprate superconductors exhibit both positive as well as negative pressure coefficients, depending on the compound and the doping state. For some hole-doped copper oxides a negative dT c /dp was reported in the overdoped regime and partially attributed to a pressure-induced charge transfer but it was also shown that this charge transfer is not the only factor affecting the pressure shift of T c (for an extensive discussion see Ref. ).Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O is, however, an electron-doped system.   This has to be taken into account if the present data are compared with the high-T c cuprates.  For electron-doped cuprates, e.g Sm 1.88 Ce 0.12 CuO 4\u2212y , the pressure coefficient of T c was found to be negative for a large number of systems with different chemical composition and (electron) doping.Thereby, a universal relation between the relative pressure coefficient, dlnT c /dp, and T c was proposed. According to this relation the pressure coefficient for a sample with T c =4.7 K should be of the order of -0.1 to -0.15 GPa \u22121 .The T c -p relation shown in Fig. is nonlinear, however, estimating the average pressure change of T c yields a value of dlnT c /dp=-0.07 GPa \u22121 and calculating the slope of T c (p) at the high pressure end of the graph we get dlnT c /dp=-0.1 GPa \u22121 .These values are in fair agreement with the typical pressure coefficient of an electron- doped high-T c superconductor with a similar ambient pressure T c."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In optimally doped YBCO, for example, the dT c /dp varies in sign and magnitude for compression along a-, b-, and c-axis resulting in a very small over- all pressure shift of T c under hydrostatic pressure conditions.  The lattice anisotropy in Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O is significant due to the huge expansion of the c-axis after intercalation of water and the compression is expected to be anisotropic as well. High pressure x-ray inves- tigations can distinguish the compression of a-and c-axis and are therefore highly desirable. For the current discussion we assume that the two-dimensionality and the expansion of the c-axis by intercalation of water in Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O is the key to understand the supercon- ductivity (this is at least assumed in all previous publications).  Then it is naturally to expect that a pressure induced decrease of the c-axis length results in a suppression of the superconducting state.However, the effects of in-plane compression are not clear and need to be investigated separately. Uniaxial pressure experiments using single crystals of Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O (not currently available) can help to separate the different contributions. A pressure induced charge transfer to the CoO 2 -layers (as discussed for the cuprate super- conductors) is unlikely as long as the intercalated water molecules remain neutral and the valence of the Na-ions is +1.  The non-linear decrease of T c observed in our investigation is equally unusual and interesting.It may suggest the possible existence of large dispersion in the energy spectrum of the compound near its Fermi surface."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Synthesis and crystal structure of transition and rare-earth metal oxypnictides (phase 1111) and superconductors based on them 2.1 Methods of synthesis Rather many ways of obtaining LnOMPn 1111-oxypnictides and superconducting materials based on them have been proposed.  These methods differ significantly by the choice of the initial reagents and the conditions of synthesis. Because the superconducting transition has now been reached only for materials based on iron-containing oxyarsenides LnOFeAs, we here mention the methods by which these systems can be obtained and which can be conditionally divided into several main groups (see ).  All polycrystalline (PC) oxyarsenides are obtained using solid-phase synthesis (SPS).Either simple substances are used as reagents or precursors (binary or, more seldom, ternary phases) are first synthesized.  Such precursors are most often binary arsenides or (and) metal oxides. The methods proposed differ in the number of stages, the temperature T and time t of annealing, and the composition of the atmosphere in which the experiment is carried out. The intermediate and final products are sometimes treated under pressure.As an illustration, we briefly present possible ways of obtaining neodymium-containing oxyarsenide NdO 1\u00c0x F x FeAs; whose samples exhibit the critical temperature T c $ 50\u00c051 K close to the highest record for this class of materials."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

After the end of the structural transition at T 145 K, a magnetic phase transition occurs due to the formation of a long-range order for Fe magnetic moments. It is noteworthy that the electron or hole doping of oxyarsenides suppresses these phase transitions. The situation described is vividly illustrated by the diagram in based on the results of experiments with fluorine-doped oxyarsenide LaO 1\u00c0x F x FeAs using muon (muon spin rotation, mSR) nuclear gamma-resonant (NGR) (on Fe nuclei) spectroscopy .  It follows that in the region of low fluorine concentrations (x < 0:04) when the tempera- ture decreases at the first stage (at T $ 155 K), a phase transition occurs from the tetragonal structure to the orthorhombic one and then (at T $ 140 K) a long-range magnetic order [i.e., the region of spin density waves (SDWs)] is formed.

It follows from the LaOFeAs DOS distribution ) that in the valence band region (in the range from \u00c05 eV to E F ), the maximum contributions belong to Fe 3d-and As 3p-states, whose hybridization determines the covalent component of Fe \u00b1 As bonds in FeAs layers.  The oxygen (arsenic) and lanthanum atomic orbitals overlap to a much lesser degree. A pictorial idea of the role of interlayer interactions in oxypnictides is suggested (using the example of LaOFeP) by the so-called construction block concept .

Furthermore, due to the electron transfer from the LaO layer to the FeP layer, a notable filling of Fe 3d states is observed in the FeP layer, whereas a forbidden gap occurs in the LaO layer spectrum in the LaOFeP crystal.At the same time, the effective atomic charges (as is shown by their numerical estimates in in accordance with the Bader scheme ) differ from the formal ionic charges, testifying to a mixed covalent-ion bond type in oxypnictides.The picture of charge distributions in these phases is demonstrated in ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

But the calculation of LaOFeAs for the AFM-S state gives the value of the magnetic moment on Fe atoms about 2 m B , which is much higher than the experimental value 0.26 \u00b1 0.36 m B . demonstrates that the Fe magnetic moment closest to the experimental result was obtained for the FM state."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

To seek magnetic CQP in some superconducting oxyarsenides, magnetic phase diagrams of LnOFeAs (Ln Pr, Nd, Sm, Ce) compounds doped with electrons or holes were calculated in the virtual crystal approximation.  Undoped LnOFeAs (Ln Pr and Nd) is a paramagnet, whereas LnOFeAs oxyarsenides, where Ln La, Sm, and Ce, are antiferromagnets with the magnetic moment on the iron atoms respectively equal to 1.62 m B , 1.08 m B , and 0.66 m B .The magnetic picture for doped LnOFeAs crystals is shown in .

It can be seen that the AFM instability region and the superconducting region overlap, with the CQP lying in the latter region.  The magnetic CQP of other oxypnictides also lies near these superconducting regions.Therefore, the occurrence of superconductivity in oxyarsenides in the vicinity of their magnetic CQP, i.e., near the magnetic instability boundary, may testify to an impor- tant role of magnetic fluctuations in the pairing mechanism for these superconductors.Such correlations between mag- netism, CQP, and superconductivity were also noticed for a number of systems with heavy fermions, such as CeRhIn 5 , CeCu 2 Si 2 , or UPd 2 Al 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The band structure, the FS topology, and FeSe magnetic interaction parameters were investigated.Finally, it was found that upon substitution of tellurium atoms for part of the selenium atoms in the FeSe composition, the obtained FeSe 1\u00c0x Te x 0:82 samples are also superconductors with T c $ 14 K .In our opinion, further detailed studies of the physical properties of superconducting FeSe (as the chemically simplest proto- type of the above-discussed family of oxypnictide and pnictide superconductors) are of considerable interest and will provide deeper insight into the origin of these interesting materials."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Consequently, the majority of carriers in such systems (as in HTSC cuprates) are holes, which distinguishes these systems from oxyarsenides, for which S < 0 [176].  The influence of the type of hole dopants (potassium or cesium) on the magnitude of the critical field in superconducting samples with similar compositions, Sr 0:6 K 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 and Sr 0:6 Cs 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 , was considered in [41]. Interesting experiments [79] on single-crystal BaFe 2 As 2 and Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 samples were carried out to study the anisotropy of the thermodynamic and electromagnetic prop- erties of these layered phases.   In particular, the room- temperature magnetic susceptibility w turns out to be close to isotropic, but in the region of decreased temperatures (T < 85 K), its anisotropy was clearly pronounced: w jjc < w cc .For superconducting Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 , the mea- sured anisotropy coefficient of the upper critical field g H cc =H jjc , measured in [79], ranges from 2.5 to 3.5. Studies of the effect of external pressure on the properties of 122 phases have begun [271 \u00b1 273]. For a superconducting single-crystal Ba 1\u00c0x K x Fe 2 As 2 sample, it was found that T c linearly decreases as the pressure increases [271].   Conversely, for nonsuperconducting CaFe 2 As 2 , a transition to the super- conducting state (with the critical temperature below T c $ 12 K) was revealed [272, 273].In recent paper [274], systematic studies of the pressure effect on the properties of undoped CaFe 2 As 2 , SrFe 2 As 2 , and BaFe 2 As 2 have been performed and their superconducting transition (Fig. 17b) was found.  In the series CaFe 2 As 2 3 SrFe 2 As 2 3 BaFe 2 As 2 , the superconducting transition region is shifted towards higher pressures, and the pressure-induced T c value increases from $ 12 K for CaFe 2 As 2 to $ 29 K for BaFe 2 As 2 . The latter value (DT c $ 29 K) is the maximum ever obtained with the application of external pressure to superconductors [274].   The parameters of superconducting states of hole-doped 122 phases were discussed on the basis of optical spectroscopy data for Ba 0:6 K 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 [275] and Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 [276] and scanning tunnel microscopy for Sr 1\u00c0x K x Fe 2 As 2 [277].  Some experiments were conducted to study the relation between the structural and magnetic characteristics of AFe 2 As 2 phases.From the optical spectroscopy data for SrFe 2 As 2 and EuFe 2 As 2 [270], a conclusion was drawn that these systems exhibit a spin instability and a pseudogap can be formed in their spectrum due to spin density waves.  Accord- ing to the data of NGR spectroscopy for 57 Fe nuclei, obtained for BaFe 2 As 2 at T 298, 77, and 4.2 K [38], a long-range magnetic order exists in this crystal at T 4 77 K.The experimental results with the use of neutron diffraction on BaFe 2 As 2 [268] and CaFe 2 As 2 [278] have allowed assuming that their low-temperature (orthorhombic) phases involve a structure formed by magnetic moments of Fe atoms (Fig. 18a).Additional information on the magnetic charac- teristics of 122 phases was obtained using NMR [279, 280], mRS, and NGR spectroscopy [281].In conclusion, we mention some interesting experimen- tal studies of the electronic properties and topology of the FS of 122 phases using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.From these data, the authors of [282, 283] reconstructed the AFe 2 As 2 FS reflecting the quasi-two- dimensional electronic structure of 122 phases and includ- ing hole cylinders in the center of the BZ and electron sheets at its edges, which agrees well with the band calculations [284] (Fig. 18b).The same method was used to analyze the FS evolution and to discuss the origin of the superconducting pseudogap under potassium doping of BaFe 2 As 2 [285 \u00b1 287].It was found in [285] that in Ba 1\u00c0x K x Fe 2 As 2 (as compared to the original BaFe 2 As 2 ), the radius of the hole cylinders (centered at the G point of"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The directions of the principal axes of Knight shift are assumed to be same as those of the electric quadrupole interaction. In the present case, the z-axis was defined along the direction, for which the component of the electric quadrupole tensor, \u03bd zz is larger than the other components. This z direction was found to be along the c-axis by fitting the positions of calculated spectra to those of aligned sample. The fitted result for the data taken at 5 K in the magnetic field H within the ab plane of Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O is shown in (b) and the parameters determined by the fitting are, K x = ~3.5\u00b10.1 %, K y = ~3.1\u00b10.05 %, the electric quadrupole resonance frequency \u03bd Q =3.6\u00b10.05 MHz and the asymmetric parameter of the electric field gradient at nuclei \u03b7=0.28\u00b10.02.

The existence of the coherence peak of the nuclear relaxation rate 1/T 1 just below T c has also been reported in the previous paper by the present authors.  These results indicate, naively speaking, that the superconducting pairs of Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O are in the singlet spin state with s-wave symmetry, though other possibilities may not be completely ruled out: Strictly speaking, the (d 1 +id 2 ) state predicted in refs. 10-13 may have a small coherence peak. Then, the precise calculation of the amplitude of the coherence peak is required to exclude such the symmetry. Even for the p-wave state predicted in refs. 14 and 15, the decrease of K spin ,y can be expected, if the direction of the triplet spins is pinned in the direction perpendicular to the y-axis. At this moment, we do not know how strong the pinning force is. To answer this question, further studies on the anisotropy of the Knight shift has to be carried out by using single crystal specimens. In summary, the T dependence of the Knight shift K y of Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O has been reported. For the (non-aligned) powder sample, the T dependence of the spin component K spin,y roughly follows the Yosida function in the superconducting state.

Let us begin this paper by re- viewing something rather old. La 2\u2212x Ba x CuO 4 (LBCO) and La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) show the local minimum of T c around x \u223c 0.12 1,2 .   It has been predicted that the disappearance in LBCO or suppression in LSCO of the superconductivity is correlated with the structural change : the structural phase transition from the mid- temperature orthorhombic phase (OMT, the space group Bmab) to the low-temperature tetragonal phase (TLT, the space group P4 2 /ncm) in LBCO and the precursor of the transition in LSCO around x = 0.12 . This prediction is verified by analysis of the crystal structure in Rare-earth doped LSCO system, which undergoes the structural phase transition to the TLT phase .In addition to the disappearance or the suppression of the superconductivity, the two related phenomena appear in these system.  One is magnetic order , and the second is anomalous changes of transport properties, such as the Hall coefficient and the thermoelectric power .It is suggested that the suppression of the superconductivity around x = 0.12 will be related with not only the crystal structure but also changes in magnetic and electronic states."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

According to this model, the long-range modulated charge and spin ordering is stabilized in the TLT phase. Afterwards, magnetic superlattice peaks are observed by neutron diffraction in the orthorhombic superconducting phase La 1.88 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 single crystal, while no peaks associ- ated with the charge ordering have been observed . Notwithstanding no signal of the charge ordering by scattering technique, the magnetic order affects the character of the superconductivity in LSCO around x = 0.12 .   Therefore, a change in electronic states must appear more or less in case of the orthorhombic phase.It is necessary for full-understanding of this problem to discuss changes in the electronic state and in the crystal structure by investigating the detailed behavior of the transport properties of so-called stripe phase in the TLT phase and of the magnetically ordered state in the OMT phase. More recently, Noda et al. reported the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient in the stripe phase La 2\u2212x\u2212y Nd y Sr x CuO 4 21 .

These experimental results seem to be commonplace, since the anomalous change of R H is observed in the TLT phase but not in the OMT phase and R H in the TLT phase goes to zero in low temperatures as expected in the simplified stripe model .  In 9 T, however, the sign reversal of R H in low temperatures is enhanced.In LYSCO, the temperature range where the sign is negative spreads and the absolute value at minimum point becomes larger, though the temperature where R H begins to fall is not changed in 9 T.Surprisingly in the orthorhombic LSCO, the sign reversal does appear below 20 K though no change of the sign is observed in 4 T."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The reason is as follows: (a) In high-T c cuprates, the sign reversal of R H in the vortex states tends to vanish as increasing magnetic fields . The data in this study is contrary to this tendency. (b) As decreasing temperature, R H begins to decrease at the vicinity of T LT in LYSCO or at \u223c50 K in LSCO rather than T c , and changes its sign continuously in each mag- netic field.   (c) In LYSCO, the sign reversal of R H occurs above T c in zero-field.(d) In policrystalline samples of LYSCO, this anomaly is significant around x = 0.115 28 .

The Gd ESR spectrum of samples with \u2248 1% substitution was obtained with a broadband microwave technique that measures power absorption bolometrically from 0.5 GHz to 21 GHz. This ESR spectrum is determined by the crystal field that lifts the level degeneracy of the spin 7/2 Gd 3+ ion and details of this spectrum provide information concerning oxygen ordering in the samples. The magnetic penetration depth is obtained by relating the number of Gd ions exposed to the microwave magnetic field to the frequency-integrated inten- sity of the observed ESR transitions.

While this is a very sensitive method, its chief drawbacks are the need to work with films and the difficulty of measuring anisotropy. Tech- niques that can resolve the anisotropy include far infrared and optical measurements that determine the inductive response of the superfluid at high frequencies. Such measurements are difficult because of their need for spec- tra over a very wide frequency range in order to per- form Kramers-Kr\u00f6nig transforms and are also suscepti- ble to error because the measured response can also in- clude screening by uncondensed carriers in addition to the superfluid. However, this approach can be used to determine the anisotropy of \u03bb simply by polarizing the light and measuring optical properties along all of the principal axes. Such infrared determinations of the ab- solute value of \u03bb at low temperature have been com- bined with microwave measurements of \u2206\u03bb(T ) to pro- duce the anisotropic 1/\u03bb 2 (T ) in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y at y=0.60 and 0.95, 14 but it would be far preferable to have a more direct microwave measurement that gives the absolute value of \u03bb, measured on the same sample as that used to determine the temperature dependence."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We use this technique here to measure the absolute value of \u03bb for all three princi- pal axes in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y . The key to the method is to embed a randomly distributed low concentration of mag- netic moments in the superconductor in such a way that they will act as local field probes and yet will minimally affect the transport properties. The magnetic moments will serve as a non-interacting spin system whose electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum is a sum of one-particle ESR transitions. The energy levels of a single spin are determined by its crystallographic environment, i.e. the charge distribution around the magnetic ion, and the re- sulting susceptibility is that of a single spin multiplied by the number of spins that participate in the ESR process. If the moments are evenly distributed in the sample, the number of spins that participate in the process is pro- portional to the fraction of the sample's volume that is exposed to the field, i.e. the volume within a penetra- tion depth of the surface. In order to count the number of spins exposed, we measure the zero field ESR absorp- tion spectrum with a microwave frequency magnetic field applied perpendicular to the principal spin axis acting as a small perturbation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Another important feature of substitution on the Y site is that the Gd impurities are expected to be weak (Born) limit quasiparticle scattering centers as was found to be the case for Ca 2+ substitution on the same site.

We used a fully-automated CAMECA SX-50 instrument, operated in the wavelength-dispersion mode with the following op- erating conditions: excitation voltage, 15 kV; beam cur- rent, 20 nA; peak count time (240 s for Gd), 20 s; back- ground count-time, 10 s each side of peak (120 s for Gd); spot diameter, 5 \u00b5m. Data reduction was done using the \"PAP\" \u03c6(\u03c1Z) method.

For the present study, we found it to be important that each Gd x Y 1\u2212x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6+y crystal was examined individually. Because the sample must be embedded in epoxy for EPMA, this was done fol- lowing all microwave measurements. For a nominal Gd concentration of x= 1% in the growth flux, the resulting concentration in the crystals was found vary to over the range from x= 1.05(.06)% to x= 1.37(.12)%.   At least 10 locations were measured on each crystal surface as a means of ensuring that the stoichiometry was homoge- neous. In all but one sample, the uniformity was within the statistical limitations of the measurement. For one sample it was necessary to examine 54 different locations covering the crystal surface to map out and take account of a small region, approximately 5% of the total surface, having an elevated Gd concentration of x= 1.50(.08)%. Measurements on the cut edges of a 100 \u00b5m thick sample confirmed that there was no gradient through the thick- ness of the sample. If the Gd concentration in the melt were to drift with time during the crystal growth, then a resulting Gd gradient in the crystal would be problematic for the following analysis."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In the present case of magnetic impurities in a superconductor, the imaginary part of the magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7 \u2032\u2032 , provides another mechanism for power absorption. Formally, the magnetic response can be included by a modification of the vacuum perme- ability \u00b5 o in Eq. 1 to include a dimensionless complex susceptibility \u03c7, written as For the case of a sufficiently low concentration of mag- netic impurities, \u03c7 \u2032 , \u03c7 \u2032\u2032 \u226a 1, and the apparent surface impedance expressions can then be rewritten as Thus, a frequency scanned measurement of the power ab- sorption will provide an apparent surface resistance with two separate contributions: one from the quasiparticle conductivity \u03c3 1 (\u03c9, T ) and one from the ESR spectrum contained in \u03c7 \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9, T ). Equation 4 reveals that a measurement of the surface reactance will contain a contribution from \u03c7 \u2032 (\u03c9, T ) in addition to probing \u03bb(T ). This is evident in the com- parison of our measurements of \u2206\u03bb(T ) in pure and Gd doped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.99, presented in Fig. .  In fact, at the outset of this work we considered the possibility of fitting the curvature arising from \u03c7 \u2032 (T ) in a low frequency mea- surement of \u2206\u03bb(T ) as a means of extracting the absolute value of \u03bb. However, it was decided that this method was not practical as it lacked the necessary sensitivity and also required knowing \u03c7 \u2032 (\u03c9, T ) a priori.

Fortunately, the broadband spectroscopy apparatus provides a means of accessing the ESR spectrum in much greater detail. Figure shows a measurement of R app s (\u03c9) from 0.5 GHz to 21 GHz at 1.3 Kelvin for a Gd 0.01 Y 0.99 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6.99 sample. The quasiparticle ab- sorption spectrum is known to be a slowly varying, mono- tonically increasing function of frequency, and the sharp ESR absorption lines (\u2206f < 0.5 GHz) are superposed. We have shown previously that the low temperature mi- crowave conductivity \u03c3 1 (\u03c9, T ) extracted from measure- ments of R s (\u03c9, T ) can be interpreted as that of weak- limit quasiparticle scattering from impurities, and here we attribute the small changes in the spectrum of Fig. to a slight increase in scattering due to the increased den- sity of out-of-plane defects in the Gd doped samples.  In order to separate the ESR contribution from the quasi- particle conductivity, we fit to the smooth background away from the ESR peaks using a second order polyno- mial, shown as a solid line in Fig. . After subtract- ing the polynomial, the remaining quantity is equal to 1 2 \u00b5 o \u03c9\u03bb\u03c7 \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) (from Eq. 4). In the subsequent section, we discuss the calculation of the quantity \u03c7 \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) from the effective spin Hamiltonian. With the theoretical curve for the susceptibility of one Gd spin in hand, we are able to fit to the experimentally determined quantity with an overall multiplicative fit parameter \u03bb. YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y single crystals grow naturally as platelets having broad ab-plane crystal faces and thin c-axis dimensions. All of our microwave measurements involve a uniform radio frequency magnetic field H rf ap- plied parallel to the broad face of the crystal in order to minimize the effects of demagnetization, as shown schematically in Fig. . It is also known that the crys- tal\u0109-axis is the principal spin axis of the Gd ions, so that the ESR response is maximized in this configura- tion. The number of Gd spins that are exposed to the microwave field is governed by the effective penetration depth \u03bb eff and, for our geometry, will always contain contributions from \u03bb a or \u03bb b and \u03bb c . In the cuprates, the two-dimensionality of the CuO 2 planes results in a large anisotropy in the penetration depth: \u03bb c \u226b \u03bb a , \u03bb b for all doping levels. In practice, this means that despite working with thin crystals having the in-plane dimension \u2113 a,b > \u223c 10\u2113 c , the\u0109-axis contribution to \u03bb eff can be large. In some cases it was also necessary to account for a small fraction t of the crystal which remained twinned (14% at most), introducing the third component of \u03bb into the measurement. Since \u03bb is small compared to any crystal dimension, it suffices to use a simple linearized relation for \u03bb eff , where \u2113 p is the in-plane crystal dimension parallel to the flow of diamagnetic screening currents (the geometry is that of Fig. ). Each component of \u03bb can be isolated by combining measurements performed on the same crys- tal but with its geometry altered in a controlled manner as attained by rotating and cleaving the crystal.

This broadening, however, does not change the overall inten- sity of the ESR line, but merely replaces the delta func- tion by some line shape function (in our case it is close to Lorentzian) whose integrated intensity is unity. In the initial stages of this work we examined optimally doped (y=0.93) crystals having three different concentrations of Gd ions; x\u2243 0.5%, x\u2243 1%, and x\u2243 3%. From these measurements, we were able to conclude that the width of the Lorentzian-shaped ESR peaks (\u03b4f = 0.35 GHz for x= 1%) scaled approximately linearly with the nominal Gd concentration x, but with a substantial x=0 inter- cept of about 0.30 GHz. Although we did not perform the detailed EPMA analysis to measure x of the nomi- nally 0.5% and 3% samples, it seems clear that at x= 1% there is a dominant contribution to the broadening that is concentration independent.  Since a dilute spin-spin interaction is expected to provide a relaxation rate that is linearly proportional to the concentration, 25 our re- sults suggest that some other process is responsible for much of the line broadening. The line width was also measured in the optimally doped samples at two differ- ent temperatures as shown in Fig. . The line widths decrease slightly upon increasing the temperature from 1 K to 3 K, indicating that spin-lattice relaxation is not likely to be the dominant process since typical relaxation mechanisms would be strongly temperature dependent."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The Gd atom has the electron configu- ration of [Xe]4f 7 5d 1 6s 2 and ionization number of three in Gd x Y 1\u2212x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 6+y. This implies that the outer shell of the ion remains exactly half filled (seven f elec- trons in fourteen states) and the system behaves like a 7/2 spin with no mixing with other S + L multiplets due to Hund's rule. The construction of an effective Hamiltonian for a spin system is based on the expan- sion of the crystal field around the magnetic ion in terms of Stevens operators. These are the operator analogues of the spherical harmonics and are functions of\u015c,\u015c z and\u015c \u00b1 , given, for example, by Abragam and Bleaney. Due to the lattice symmetries and the finite spin of the magnetic ion, the expansion reduces to a finite sum of operators H = p,q B p q O p q where the B p q are numerical coefficients called the crystal field parameters. The high- est order of Stevens operator O p q allowed for a spin of 7/2 in a crystal field is 6 since the matrix elements of the Stevens operators between two spin states are zero unless p \u2264 2S. The order is restricted to even values by the required time reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the ab-plane anisotropy is so small that for most purposes one can assume \u03c0/2 rotation symmetry about the\u0109-axis; orthorhombicity is most significant in the overdoped samples.

Here we will consider line split- ting associated with distinct Gd environments and sim- ply handle the line width as a parameter in a Lorentzian fit.

Other ordered phases are: ortho-III with FFE (full, full, empty) chains and ortho-VIII with FFEFFEFE chains. In each of these phases there is more than one possible chain configura- tion around the Gd ions. Having detailed spectra at each doping allows us to identify the different bands and fit each spectrum with a set of crystal field parameters for each band. The fitted \u03c7 \u2032\u2032 spectra are shown in Fig. . In each spectrum, the relative intensities of the different bands is a measure of the relative number of Gd ions in each configuration. This information can be used as a measure of the amount of oxygen in the sample: where n is the number of full nearest neighbor CuO chains in the band and I n is the observed relative inten- sity of the line associated with a particular band. The oxygen content is given by 6 + y. The ESR measured oxygen content versus the chemically measured content is presented in Fig. . Note that the ESR points consis- tently underestimate the amount of oxygen in the crys- tals. This is likely due to the inefficiency of isolated oxy- gens in empty chains in promoting a hole into the CuO 2 planes. The above oxygen content analysis assumes max- imal length of chains, i.e. all chains are either full or missing with no isolated oxygens or vacancies. Since the Gd ions are likely to be sensing the presence of chains through their influence on the charge distribution on the much nearer CuO 2 planes, an isolated oxygen ion hardly affects the crystal field environment since it does not pro- mote a hole into the planes. Thus a Gd ion near an iso- lated oxygen in an otherwise empty chain will experience the crystal field of an empty chain. This will lead to an underestimate of the oxygen content, but will not affect the overall counting of Gd ions. It is also interesting to note that the ESR analysis pro- vides a good measure of the chain disorder. For exam- ple, perfect three dimensional ortho-II ordering should produce only one band, corresponding to two full chains, the D-band. However, our ortho-II spectrum displays two additional bands (the B-and F-bands) resulting from imperfections in the ortho-II ordering. These de- viations can be interpreted as ortho-II phase boundaries. Our ortho-III and ortho-VIII spectra are consistent with long range ortho-III and ortho-VIII order along the ab plane but random stacking along the\u0109-direction."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We have shown that our crystal field parameters agree very well with those obtained by previous authors using the completely differ- ent method of high field ESR on powdered samples. Our results also support the conclusions of the same work which found that isolated oxygens in vacant chains do not influence the CF configuration around the magnetic ion and therefore cannot be distinguished from a vacant chain via ESR spectroscopy. This is in accord with the fact that isolated oxygens do not promote holes from the copper-oxygen planes. The principal result of this work is a set of new values for the penetration depth in all three crystal- lographic directions for three oxygen-ordered phases of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y which are summarized in Table .  The\u0109- axis penetration depth is large and increases very rapidly with decreasing doping, as observed previously in in- frared measurements of \u03bb c by Homes et al. The in-plane measurements are in accord with the results of Sonier et al. who performed \u00b5SR measurements on mosaics of high-purity, detwinned single crystals at two other oxy- gen dopings. The muon measurements are unable to di- rectly determine anisotropies, but they compare well with the geometric mean of the ab-plane values reported here. A sample of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.60 with T c = 59 K was found to have \u03bb ab = 170 nm, 30 very close to the geometric mean \u221a \u03bb a \u03bb b = 168\u00b126 nm of the T c = 56 K sample studied here.   An optimally doped sample of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.95 with T c = 93 K had \u03bb ab = 112 nm, 4 which lies between the means of the T c = 75 K sample (125\u00b112 nm) and the overdoped T c = 89 K sample (91\u00b16 nm) studied here.The agreement reflects the particular care taken in these \u00b5SR measurements to cover a wide range of applied mag- netic fields in order to ascertain the low field limiting values and thus minimize the non-linear, non-local, and other effects that can arise in the vortex state.It must also be noted that the \u00b5SR measurements hinge on a detailed model of the vortex lattice that provides a fit to the field distribution detected by the muons."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

However, the basic picture of chain- driven anisotropy is supported by our new microwave measurements, which also show substantial anisotropy in the ortho-II ordered sample, but rather less in the ortho-III sample, a sensible trend since the ortho-III ordering is much poorer, leading to more fragmented chains. Much of the work on the doping-dependence of \u03bb ab has relied on muon spin relaxation measurements on poly- crystalline samples. In these measurements, the field in- homogeneity in the vortex state gives rise to dephasing of the precessing spins of implanted muons. A Gaussian fit is often used to extract a relaxation rate \u03c3 which is deemed proportional to 1/\u03bb 2 . As long as the material is nearly two dimensional, the constant of proportionality can be calculated to be \u03c3 = 7.09\u00d710 4 \u03bb \u22122 , with \u03c3 in \u00b5s \u22121 and \u03bb in nm. In the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y system, this very simple treatment of muon data gives values of \u03bb ab that are typically 20% or more larger than the single crystal data reported here. The resulting underestimate of the superfluid density, together with the problematic ab-plane anisotropy, mean that the single crystal pene- tration depths reported here can offer a clearer picture of the doping dependence of the superfluid density in the CuO 2 planes.

Also shown are the \u00b5SR measurements of Sonier et al. on single crystal mosaics. The data do not support a case for scaling of Tc \u221d 1/\u03bb 2 a in this doping range above Tc = 56 K. superfluid phase stiffness proportional to T c on the under- doped side of the cuprate phase diagram, is not supported by the new data presented here, at least for T c \u2265 56 K.   The measurements on YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.993 , which is slightly past optimal doping, are certainly up in the \"plateau\" regime for this material and would not be expected to follow T c \u221d 1/\u03bb 2 . However, even for the lower two dop- ings with T c = 56 K and T c = 75 K the\u00e2-axis phase stiffness, which avoids contributions associated with the CuO chains, is still far from a relationship of the form T c \u221d 1/\u03bb 2 a .The plot instead suggests a sublinear depen- dence of T c on 1/\u03bb 2 a , since T c must fall to zero when 1/\u03bb 2 does. Further data at low doping will be needed to clarify the relationship over the entire doping range.    Interest- ingly, the latest muon spin relaxation studies by Tallon et al. also suggest a sublinear relationship, although the values of \u03bb in that study are significantly larger than the single crystal data presented here.  In the past, T c \u221d 1/\u03bb 2 has been seen as evidence that phase fluctuations play a central role in setting T c on the underdoped side of the cuprate phase diagram. Indeed, the relatively low values of phase stiffness in the cuprates, plus the ob- servation of critical fluctuations near the superconduct- ing transistion, do indicate that phase fluctuations play a role in determining T c .However, the deviation from a linear relationship seen in Fig. suggests that other factors must also contribute to the critical temper- ature.The obvious candidate is thermal excitation of nodal quasiparticles, which give rise to the linear temperature dependence of \u03bb(T ) and rapidly deplete the superfluid density as temperature rises.However, the central puzzle regarding the correlation between super- fluid density and T c still remains in such a scenario.As the doping decreases, the zero temperature value of the superfluid density becomes much smaller, so that it be- comes easy for quasiparticle excitations, in addition to fluctuations, to drive the material normal at a lower T c.The mystery still lies in understanding why the superfluid density becomes so small with decreasing hole doping."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The lattice parameters a and c are 2.8245 and 19.7101 \u00c5, respectively. The uniform magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 was measured using a SQUID magnetometer with magnetic fields H= 5 Oe and 1 T.  The data for H= 5 Oe are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of T, where the onset of the superconductivity is found at T ~4.5 K.  The magnitudes of diamagnetic signals taken at T =2.0 K under the conditions of zero-field cooling and field cooling correspond to the volume fractions of ~24% and ~6%, respectively.These values are rather large for the powder sample with two-dimensional nature and therefore exclude the possibility that the superconductivity is filamentary. The T 1 of Co nuclei was measured by detecting nuclear magnetization after applying an inversion pulse in the frequency region around 3\u03bd Q (the 5/2\u21927/2 transition), \u03bd Q being the electrical quadrupolar frequency (~4.2 MHz at 4.23 K). This value of \u03bd Q is consistent with the one estimated from the 59 Co NMR spectra of this sample. The nuclear magnetization m measured as a function of time t elapsed after the inversion pulse, was analyzed under the assumption that there exist two components with shorter and longer relaxation times, T 1short and T 1long , respectively. The following theoretical equation with the number fraction c of nuclear spins which have a shorter relaxation time T 1short , was used. A typical example of the fittings to the observed m-t curves is shown in the inset of Fig. . The c values are found to be ~(0.96-0.98). T 1long is of the order of 1 s and the origin of this longer relaxation time may be due to the existence of a small amount of impurity phase(s). Because T 1short is smaller than T 1long /10 even in the lowest temperature region, both kinds of T 1 can be reliably estimated.

To get a clue for answering these questions, we compare the results with those of superconductors with magnetic impurities. La 3 Al is considered to have a superconducting gap with s-wave symmetry. For La 3-x Gd x Al obtained by doping of magnetic Gd atoms, T c decreases to 0.6T c (x=0) for x=0.02.  For the sample, the 1/T 1 -T curve of 27 Al exhibits the coherence peak just below T c . 1/T 1 gradually decreases as T decreases, where it has been considered that due to effects of the Gd magnetic moments, the nuclear spin relaxation rate does not exhib it an exponential-type decay at low temperatures. The similarity of the behaviors of 1/T 1 of the present system to those observed for La 3-x Gd x Al seems to indicate that the present system has an s-wave type energy gap and that exponential-type dependence of 1/T 1 on 1/T cannot be observed because of the effects of a very small amount of magnetic moments which may exist in the sample.

In Fig. 5, the relaxation rate of Na 0.75 CoO 2 is shown in the form of 1/T 1 T -T, together with that of Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O, where the relation 1/ 59 T 1 T \u2245 a+b/T (a ~3/K/s and b ~21/s) holds for Na 0.75 CoO 2 . As for the Knight shift, the isotropic part K iso of Na x CoO 2 (x=0.5 ~0.75) exhibits very weak T-dependence and does not follow the T dependence of \u03c7, while the anisotropic part follows the T dependence of \u03c7. 9) As was discussed in detail in ref. 9, these results indicate that the electron system of Na 0.75 CoO 2 is essentially itinerant and the b/T term can be considered to be the contribution from the Co sites around the localized Co moments, which are probably induced by lattice imperfections within the CoO 2 layers.  The susceptibility corresponding to these itinerant electrons is deduced by subtracting the Curie term as shown by the chain line in Fig. 3. For Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O, the susceptibility of the itinerant electrons is similarly deduced and shown by the broken line in Fig. 3. The ratios of the susceptibilities of these itinerant electron systems of Na 0.75 CoO 2 and Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O and the T-independent parts of 1/ 59 T 1 T are both about 1 : 4.   Since 1/T 1 T depends on the square of the density of states N(\u03b5 F ) at the Fermi level, the equal ratios obtained for the susceptibilities and for 1/ 59 T 1 T cannot be explained if the effects of electron correlation are not considered.The results should be considered to indicate that the metallic state of Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O is closer to a ferromagnetic phase than that of Na 0.75 CoO 2 . (As was reported in ref. 10, Na x CoO 2 itself is located in the proximity of a ferromagnetic phase.)  The present results indicate that the superconductivity of Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O appears near a ferromagnetic phase and has s-wave symmetry.  We find, in 1/T 1 T of Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O, a component proportional to 1/T (see Figs. ).It may be a contribution from localized moments in the sample as in the case of Na 0.75 CoO 2 .Although the magnitude of the component is smaller than that observed for Na 0.75 CoO 2, the rate of decrease of 1/T 1 T with decreasing T becomes larger in the temperature region well below T c , when the component proportional to 1/T is subtracted from the observed values."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The structure is composed of thick insulating layers of Na atoms and H 2 O molecules, as well as conducting CoO 2 layers. In the CoO 2 layer, CoO 6 octahedra are connected to each other by edge sharing with the Co sites forming a triangular lattice. On the other hand, the valence of the Co ion is between 3+ (3d 6 ) and 4+ (3d 5 ) as in the case of Na 0.5 CoO 2. Co 3+ and Co 4+ ions often have low spin states with S=0 and 1/2, respectively. At the early stage of research, this compound was considered as a system of S=1/2 triangular lattice doped with electrons and the doped resonating- valence-bond (RVB) model was expected to be valid for explaining its superconductivity. Now, it is widely recognized that the electron density of this compound is so large that the doped RVB model can not be applied simply.

One school of thought suggests that the doped charge carriers segregate into inhomogeneous patterns, such as stripes, to allow the antiferromagnetic (AF) regions to survive . In this picture, the observed quasi two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate spin density wave (SDW) in hole-doped high-T c superconductors, such as La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 (3) and La 2 CuO 4+\u03b4 (4), is due to remnants of the AF insulating phase that compete with superconductivity (SC) .   Alternatively, carrier doping into the CuO 2 planes may evolve the system through a quantum phase transition (QPT) between competing ordered and disordered phases .While much is unknown about these competing phases and their relationship to SC, the presence of such a QPT has been reported in both hole-doped and electron- doped (12) materials."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Specifically, we find that when SC first appears in PLCCO with increasing doping, a quasi-2D commensurate SDW modulation is also induced, and both coexist with the three-dimensional (3D) AF state.  The N\u00e9el temperature (T N ) of both the 2D and 3D AF phases decreases linearly with increasing T c and vanishes when optimal SC is achieved . Combined with earlier reports , our discovery establishes that the quasi-2D SDW modulation and its associated electronic inhomogeneity are general features of charge-carrier-doped copper oxides. Such microscopic heterogeneity naturally results from the competition of different order parameters near a QPT.  Traditionally, the transition from AF to SC in copper oxides is achieved by chemical doping, which also introduces additional complications such as structural and/or chemical disorder that may mask the nature of the transition .We choose to study this transition in electron-doped PLCCO because, as-grown, these materials are nonsuperconducting (NSC) AF insulators and SC can be achieved by only annealing the samples with minor oxygen modification that changes the charge carrier density .  While recent neutron scattering experiments on superconducting Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 4 (NCCO) show a drastic suppression of the static 3D AF order, how SC is established is unknown in part because the magnetic nature of the Nd 3+ in NCCO complicates the interpretation of the data .A systematic investigation on single crystals of PLCCO, where the Pr 3+ has a nonmagnetic singlet ground state , should shed new light on our understanding of the transition from the AF to SC."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In this scenario one would expect to observe both a sharp T c and a robust T N weakly depending on oxygen doping as in the case of oxygen-doped La 2 CuO 4 .  However, the drastic decrease in 3D transition to long range magnetic order (T N decreasing from 186 K for NSC to 40 K for T c = 21 K sample) combined with relatively sharp magnetic transition [as in hole-doped La 2 CuO 4 demonstrates that this is not the case. The relatively broad SC transition is then a consequence of an intrinsic electronic inhomogeneity occurring on a length scale longer than the (short) SC coherence length.   While neutrons are a bulk probe and cannot determine how SC coexists with the AF phases at zero-field, magnetic field experiments show that the AF phase competes directly with SC .In this case, the observed commensurate quasi-2D SDW in PLCCO is analogous to the incommensurate 2D SDW in hole-doped La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 and La 2 CuO 4+\u03b4 . In the electron-doped case, the commensurate SDW may arise from the in-phase domains of \"stripes\" (22), as compared to the anti-phase domains of \"stripes\" in hole-doped materials .While a detailed picture of PLCCO may be obtained from future spin dynamical measurements, it appears that microscopic heterogeneity and the resulting competition of different order parameters are general features of doped copper oxides near a QPT ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Typical collimations were, proceeding from the reactor to the detector, 48'-40'-40'-120' (full-width at half- maximum), and the final neutron energy was fixed at E f = 14.78 meV with ~1 meV energy resolution. The monochromator, analyzer and filters were all pyrolytic graphite. (a) The noncollinear type-I/III spin structure of the 3D AF order in PLCCO (23,24). (b) Expected Bragg peaks from the AF structure of (a). (c) T-dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for the four crystals investigated.  The T c = 24 K, and 21 K samples were obtained by annealing as- grown single crystals in pure Ar at 970 \u00b0C and 940 \u00b0C for 24 hours, respectively.To obtain the T c = 16 K crystal, the as-grown sample was annealed in pure Ar at 915 \u00b0C for 1 week.

Elastic neutron scattering measurements in magnetic fields for LSCO with x = 0.10 (Ref. ) under the orthorhombic mid-temperature (OMT) structure (space group: Bmab) have revealed that the intensity of the in- commensurate magnetic peaks around (\u03c0, \u03c0) in the recip- rocal lattice space increases with increasing field parallel to the c-axis, suggesting the stabilization of the mag- netic order. For LSCO with x = 0.12, on the other hand, the enhancement of the incommensurate magnetic peaks is observable but small.  The magnetic order is considered to be almost stabilized even in zero field for x \u223c 1/8, so that the development of the magnetic order by the application of magnetic field is slight.

It is well-known that the broadening of the superconduct- ing transition curve observed for x = 0.08 is charac-teristic of the underdoped high-T c cuprates with large superconducting fluctuation.  On the other hand, the parallel shift of the superconducting transition curve is observed for x = 0.11 and 0.12 and for x = 0.10 above 9 T.  The parallel shift has also been observed in LNSCO with x = 0.15 (Ref. ) and LSCO with x = 0.12 (Ref. ) where the static stripe order of charges and/or spins is formed at low temperatures.These suggest that both the superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation and the static stripe order are realized in one sample.  Here, it is an important is- sue whether the superconducting region and the static stripe-ordered one coexist microscopically or are sepa- rated macroscopically. From the neutron scattering mea- surements in La 1.875 Ba 0.125\u2212x Sr x CuO 4 , the static stripe order has been suggested to compete with the supercon- ductivity. Moreover, from the muon-spin-relaxation measurements in La 2\u2212x Sr x Cu 1\u2212y Zn y O 4 around x = 1/8, it has been suggested that the superconductivity is de- stroyed in a region where frequencies of the dynamical stripe fluctuations are lower than \u223c 10 11 Hz.There- fore, the superconducting region and the static stripe- ordered one are probably separated macroscopically."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Considering the results of the elastic neutron scattering measurements mentioned in Sec. I, the negligibly small increase of \u03c1 ab below T d2 with increasing field for x = 0.11 and 0.12 seems to indicate that the stripe order is nearly perfectly stabilized in zero field and is insensitive to the applied field. As for x = 0.10, the marked increase of \u03c1 ab below T d2 with increasing field reminds us some possible origins.  The first is the normal-state magnetoresistance. However, this is not applicable, because the normal-state magnetoresistance is usually as small as an order of 1 % at 15 T, as in the case of x = 0.11 and 0.12. The sec- ond is the suppression of the superconducting fluctuation by the applied field. The positive magnetoresistance ap- pears even at temperatures just below T d2 far from T onset c in high fields.  On the other hand, reports on the Nernst effect in LSCO have suggested that the vortex state sur- vives even at higher temperatures far above T c , meaning that the superconducting fluctuation exists even at high temperatures.Therefore, this possible origin can- not be excluded and further measurements are needed to conclude.  Nevertheless, it appears that this is not a can- didate, because the large positive magnetoresistance is observed only for x = 0.10 and not for x = 0.11 nor 0.12.The third is enhancement of the localization of holes in-"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The localization behavior of \u03c1 ab becomes marked with increasing field and appears to approach the behavior of LNSCO with x = 0.12 where the stripe order is perfectly stabilized. In the long run, the most probable origin is that the charge-spin stripe order is stabilized by the applied field in x = 0.10.

So far, it has been clarified in the underdoped LSCO and BSLCO that \u03c1 ab in the normal state shows the ln(1/T ) dependence at low temperatures in magnetic fields, suggesting that the ln(1/T ) dependence is a common feature of the underdoped high-T c cuprates.   To check this suggestion, \u03c1 ab 's of LBCO with x = 0.10, 0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12 at 15 T are plotted ver- sus lnT , as shown in .Below \u223c 20 K, it is found that \u03c1 ab in the normal state is proportional to ln(1/T ) in each x, though \u03c1 ab deviates downward from ln(1/T ) at low temperatures because of the superconducting transi- tion for x = 0.10 and 0.11.   The small deviation below 3 K for x = 0.12 is irrelevant to the superconducting tran- sition, because \u03c1 ab is independent of the field strength for H \u2265 11 T, as seen in .   The slope of the ln(1/T ) dependence is found to increase with increas- ing x, indicating that the localization of holes becomes strong with increasing x toward x = 1/8 at 15 T.The ln(1/T ) dependence is known to be characteristic of the weak localization and the electron-electron interaction in the two-dimensional Anderson-localized state where the in-plane electrical conductivity \u03c3 ab actually changes in proportion to ln(1/T ) even in magnetic fields.   For x = 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12, however, \u03c3 ab does not show the ln(1/T ) dependence below T d2 , as in the case of the un- derdoped LSCO.Although the true origin of the ln(1/T ) dependence of \u03c1 ab is not clear, the localization of holes with the ln(1/T ) dependence observed widely in the underdoped high-T c cuprates is robust even in the stripe-ordered state of LBCO and LNSCO. V. SUMMARY It has been found that the superconducting transition curve shows the parallel shift by the application of mag- netic field in LBCO with x = 0.11 and LNSCO with x = 0.12 where the charge-spin stripe order is formed at low temperatures. These suggest that both the su- perconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation and the static stripe order are realized in one sample for x = 0.11 and 0.12.For LBCO with x = 0.10, the broad- ening in low fields changes to the parallel shift in high fields above 9 T.Moreover, \u03c1 ab in the normal state be- low T d2 increases with increasing field up to 15 T.It is possible that these pronounced features of x = 0.10 are understood in terms of the field-induced stabilization of the charge stripe order.The \u03c1 ab in the normal state at low temperatures has been found to be proportional to ln(1/T ) for x = 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12, suggesting the lo- calization of holes with the ln(1/T ) dependence of \u03c1 ab which is robust even in the stripe-ordered state of LBCO and LNSCO."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Until now, various Fe-based superconductors, such as ZrCuSiAs-type LnFeAsO (Ln stands for rare earth elements) -, ThCr 2 Si 2 -type AeFe 2 As 2 (Ae stands for alkali earth elements) , Fe 2 As-type AFeAs (A is Li or Na) -and anti-PbO-type Fe(Se, Te) , have been reported.    The T c of anti-PbO-type FeSe could reach 37 K under 4.5 GPa from T c \u21e0 8 K at ambient pressure .Very recently, by intercalating K, Rb, Cs and Tl in between the FeSe layers, superconductivity was enhanced to about 30 K without any external pressure in the Fe-Se system -, and it provides a new type of iron-based superconductor to explore high T c . For the iron-pnictide, the pressure tends to destroy the magnetic transition in the undoped compounds, and T c increases with increasing pressure for underdoped iron-pnictides, remaining approximately constant for optimal doping and decreasing linearly in the overdoped range .    Superconductivity can be induced via pressure in the parent compounds AFe 2 As 2 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu) -.Magnetism and superconductivity are strongly correlated with each other in iron-based superconductors.The strong pressure effect in FeSe may be related to its strongly enhanced antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations under pressure .Therefore, we wonder whether the strong pressure effect still exists in A x Fe 2 Se 2.It is very meaningful to carry out high-pressure measurements in these newly found superconductors."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The pressure tends to destroy the magnetic transition in the undoped compounds and T c increases with increasing pressure for underdoped iron-pnictides and monotonically decreases in the overdoped region.The different effects of pressure on T c between the crystals K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1 and K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2 is easily understood because K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1 is in the slightly overdoped range, while K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2 is in the underdoped range. shows the pressure dependence of the resistivity hump temperature for Cs x Fe 2 Se 2 , K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1 and K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2.We defined the hump temperature when the resistivity reached its"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The T c as a function of pressure for K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2 shows a dome-like behavior and reaches its maximum T c at the pressure of 0.48 GPa. In contrast, T c is gradually suppressed with increasing pressure for K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1.    The pressure dependence of T c for K x Fe 2 Se 2 -2 and Cs x Fe 2 Se 2 is quite similar to that observed in the LaO 1 x F x FeAs and parent iron-pnictides . In contrast, for K x Fe 2 Se 2 -1, the pressure dependence of T c is similar to that observed in the overdoped iron-pnictides .The maximum T c for the two batches of single crystals K x Fe 2 Se 2 is the same, and is reached at ambient pressure and 0.48 GPa, respectively. The difference in T c between the two batches of single crystal K x Fe 2 Se 2 is very small (just 1.5 K), while the temperature of the resistivity hump is 245 and 130 K, respectively.This indicates that the hump temperature strongly depends on the sample.  The hump behavior could originate from the vacancy of Fe or Se.Another piece of evidence is that the normal state resistivity is very high compared with other iron-pnictide superconductors because the vacancy in conducting FeSe layers leads to a strong scattering and consequently high resistivity.This suggests that the physical behavior of A x Fe 2 Se 2 is very sensitive to the deficiency, and a change in the deficiency strongly affects the normal state resistivity although the T c does not change too much."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The pyrochlore has a general formula of A 2 B 2 O 7 , consisting of BO 6 octahedra and eightfold coordinated A cations, where A and B are transition metals and/or rare-earth elements.  In particular, the B sublattice can be viewed as a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra, providing a testing ground for studying the role of geometrical frustration in sys- tems which have local spins at B sites with antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation.Such systems are known to remain frustrated even when the exchange interaction is ferromagnetic (FM), provided that the spin correlation has local Ising anisotropy. Recent studies have revealed a rich variety of phenomena seemingly related to the geometrical frustration, such as the occurrence of a spin-glass (SG) phase in R 2 Mo 2 O 7 with R=Y, Tb and Dy , the unusual behavior of ordinary and anomalous Hall coefficients in the same compound with R=Nd, Sm and Gd , and the \"spin-ice\" phase in R 2 Ti 2 O 7 with R=Dy and Ho. Although metallic pyrochlores comprise a minority subgroup of the pyrochlore family, they consist of distinct members such as Tl 2 Mn 2 O 7 , which exhibits colossal magnetoresis- tance.   Moreover, the recently revealed superconductivity in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 , a 5d transition metal pyrochlore , demonstrates that the pyrochlores provide a fertile field for elec- tronic correlation adjacent to the perovskite compounds.   In this context, it is noteworthy that LiV 2 O 4 , a cubic spinel compound in which the V sublattice is isostructural to the B sublattice in pyrochlore, behaves similarly to a heavy fermion metal. It is reported that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 falls into the bulk superconducting state below T c \u2243 1 \u223c 2 K, as confirmed by a large jump of specific heat \u2206C c as well as large diamagnetism due to the Meissner effect associated with the occurrence of zero resistivity.   The dc magnetization curve indicates that the superconductivity is of type II with the upper critical field close to 0.29 T at 0 K.The ratio \u2206C c /\u03b3T c (with \u03b3 being the Sommerfeld constant) is reported to be 1.15, which is smaller than the predicted value of 1.43 for isotropic BCS superconductors.Unfortunately, these measurements were performed only above 0.4 K and are thus inconclusive in determining the detailed characteristics of superconductivity in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 .In this Letter, we report on the quasiparticle excitations in the mixed state of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 studied by muon spin rotation/relaxation (\u00b5SR).The magnetic penetration depth \u03bb, which reflects the population of normal electrons (\"quasiparticles\") in the superconductive state, is determined microscopically by measuring the muon spin relaxation due to the spatial inhomogeneity of magnetic induction in the flux line lattice (FLL).We show that the temperature dependence of \u03bb is more or less consistent with the prediction based on the BCS superconductors with an isotropic gap, although a slight discrepancy is suggested by the detailed analysis."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In general, the field dependence of \u03bb is enhanced by two different mechanisms, i.e., the nonlinear effect in the semiclassical Doppler shift of the quasiparticle energy levels due to the supercurrent around the vortex cores, and the nonlocal effect which further modifies the quasiparticle excitation spectrum in the momentum space. In particular, the nonlocal effect is important in the system with line nodes because the coherence length is inversely proportional to the order parameter, such that \u03be 0 (k) =hv F /\u03c0\u2206k. The divergence of \u03be 0 along the nodal directions |\u2206k| = 0 means that the response of quasiparticles near the nodes is highly nonlocal. It is predicted that \u03b7 \u226a 1 for the isotropic s-wave pairing because the finite gap prevents the shifted levels of quasiparticle excitations from being occupied at low temperatures.

The disappearance of superconductivity in Li 1+x Ti 2-x O 4 for x > 0.15 was concluded to be due to grain boundary effects. It has attracted a lot of attentions due to at least having the following physical significances related to the present studies.For example, it is the only spinel oxide superconductor (T c ~1 2 K) so far to our knowledge.   Also, it is the rare oxide superconductor showing a sharp superconducting anomaly in specific heat (C) in contrast to an unpronounced one in polycrystalline BaPb 1-x Bi x O 3 with a comparable T c ~1 2 K.  The upper critical field H c2 (0) of LiTi 2 O 4 reported by several groups varied from 2 to 32.8 T. Issues like whether the superconductivity in LiTi 2 O 4 can be well explained in the framework of BCS theory based upon the electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions and the role of the electron-electron (e-e) interactions have not been totally clearified.Some theoretical predictions showed that LiTi 2 O 4 was a strong coupling BCS superconductor while the low temperature specific heat and magnetic susceptibility data implied for the conditions for weak coupling d-band superconductivity.    Furthermore, there has been a very recently revived debate on Anderson's resonating valance bond (RVB)-type ground state as the possible origin of superconductivity in cuprates.Since the Ti sub-lattice of the spinel structure allows a high degree of frustration, RVB ground state is probable in the LiTi 2 O 4 spinel.  In fact, the specific heat (C), a thermodynamic bulk property unlike resistivity and magnetization, of LiTi 2 O 4 has been elaborately studied by some groups in the absence of magnetic field (H).Though some of the derived parameters (listed in Table) agree quite well with each other, some of them differ significantly and lead to incompatible descriptions for the nature of superconductivity.These controversies especially warrant a comprehensive revisit of superconductivity in LiTi 2 O 4 .In addition, the recent intensive investigations of its isostructural compounds LiMn 2 O 4 (Ref. ) and LiV 2 O 4 (Refs. 4 and 16) exhibiting respectively high-voltage electrolyte and 3d heavy fermion behavior also tempt us to study the crucial role of 3d metals in the spinel oxide structure.In particular, it is interesting to study the evolution from 3d superconductivity to 3d heavy fermion in Li(Ti 1-x V x ) 2 O 4 .In this report, we thus provide the detailed magnetic field (up to 8 T) dependence of the low temperature specific heat on LiTi 2 O 4, which has never been reported in the literature earlier and is crucial to the determination of superconducting properties, to explore its pairing mechanism of superconductivity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The low temperature specific heat C(T,H) was measured with a 3 He heat-pulsed thermal relaxation calorimeter in the temperature range from 0.6 to 20 K under different C(T,H)/T vs. T 2 of LiTi 2 O 4 without and with a magnetic field of 8 T.

The normal state specific heat in the absence of magnetic field, is extracted from H = 8 T data between 8 and 20 K, where \u03b3 n T is the electronic term due to free charge carriers and C lattice (T) = \u03b2T 3 + \u03b1T 5 is representing the phonon contribution which is assumed to be independent of magnetic field. It is found that \u03b3 n = 19.15 \u00b1 0.20 (mJ/mol K 2 ), \u03b2 = 0.048 \u00b1 0.002 (mJ/mol K 4 ), and \u03b1 = 0.00012 \u00b1 0.00005 (mJ/mol K 6 ) give the best fitting (solid line in Fig. ) to the experimental data. It is noted that if we take C lattice (T) = \u03b2T 3 + \u03b1T 5 + DT , the best fit occurs at negative value of D ( = -2.8\u00b10.5 x 10 -7 mJ/mol K 8 ) which is unreasonable. On the other hand, C lattice (T)= \u03b2T 3 gives much higher RMS value compared to C lattice (T) = \u03b2T 3 + \u03b1T . The enhancement of \u03b3 n by the electron-phonon interaction is given by 19 where N(E F ) is the band structure density of states at the Fermi level, k B is the Boltzman constant, and \u03bb is the electron-phonon interaction constant. Taking \u03bb = 0.65 as obtained from low temperature specific heat data (discussed later), the calculated value of N(E F ) for the present sample is ~ 0.70 states/eV atom. This is lower than that (~ 0.97 states/eV atom) perceived by McCallum et al. from susceptibility data which would not satisfy the transition temperature from McMillan equation.  However, the authors 2 indicated that the reduction of N(E F ) by 15% (orbital contribution and/or exchange enhancement to total susceptibility) would explain it. The reduced N(E F ) is in close agreement with the present investigation.The Debye temperature \u0398 D = 657 \u00b133 K is derived by using the relation where n is the number of atoms per formula unit and takes 7 for LiTi 2 O 4 .  This is somewhat higher than those experimentally obtained and theoretically predicted values (~575 K) but closer to those (685-700 K) reported by the group of D.  C.Johnston. The values of \u03b3 n , N(E F ), and \u0398 D are listed in Table along with some other parameters for comparison with reported results. The characteristics of superconducting phase transition in LiTi 2 O 4 can be analyzed using the relation The resultant \u00e4C(T)/T vs. T is shown in Fig. , where the inset illustrates the conservation of entropy S = \u222b c T dT T C 0 \u03b4 around the transition. This conservation of entropy is essential for a second order, such as superconducting-normal, phase transition. In this case, fail to include \u03b1T 5 term in Eq. will not totally satisfy this requirement.  In fact, this requirement may be used to testify the justification of the values of \u03b3 n and \u0398 D . The dimensionless specific-heat jump at T c is \u00e4C/\u03b3 n T c = 1.78 as indicated in Fig. which is greater than the typical weak coupling value (~1.43). Thus \u00e4C(T)/T is well fitted to the BCS model as shown in Fig. by the solid line with a little higher 2\u2206/k B T c (~ 4.0), where \u2206 is the superconducting energy gap instead of the weak coupling value (~ 3.52).This value of 2\u2206/k B T c ~ 4 (i.e. \u2206 = 1.97 meV) is consistent with 3.8 in the Ref. 3] and the reference therein where the tunneling experiments yielded the value of 4.0.Consequently, the superconductivity in LiTi 2 O 4 can be explained by the moderate coupling BCS framework though the early low temperature specific heat and theoretical calculations respectively indicated weak and strong coupling."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The dissimilar example has been observed in Ba 1-x K x BiO 3 (Ref. ) due to defects and the inhomogeneity of the sample. Figure demonstrates the magnetic field dependence of very low temperature (\u2264 5 K) specific heat as C/T vs. T 2 .  The coefficient of electronic specific heat \u03b3(H) with various fields has been estimated from the linear extrapolation of data below 2 K down to 0 K. In order to investigate the low energy vortex excitation under magnetic fields, the variation of \u03b3(H) with H is shown in Fig. . The best fit leads to \u03b3(H) ~ H 0.95 as indicated by the solid line. Clearly, \u03b3(H) follows an H dependence which is very close to be linear, especially for H \u2265 1 T. The slight deviation in low H could be due to the vortex-vortex interaction as discussed in Refs. 22 and 23.

Theoretically, \u03b3(H) is expected to be proportional to H for a conventional s-wave superconductor. However, \u03b3(H) \u221d H 0.5 is predicted for a nodal superconductivity.In fact, \u03b3(H) of cuprate superconductors has been extensively studied in this context.Consequently, the magnetic field dependence of \u03b3(H) suggests that LiTi 2 O 4 is an s-wave superconductor in nature."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The band structure calculations indicate that the Fermi level of LiTi 2 O 4 in the partially filled conduction band lies in an electronic structure which is not too far from the free-electron-like one with a mass renormalization factor. By the free electron model with \u00f1 res = 6.9\u00d7 10 -5 \u00d9-cm and the carrier concentration n = 1.35\u00d7110 23 cm -3 (Ref. ), the estimated l = 32 \u00c5 is indeed shorter than \u03be GL (0). Therefore, the above analysis using Eq. in the dirty limit regime is self-consistent. In addition, the issue of the mass renormalization factor in the previous literature was actually unsolved. A large \u03bb tot = 1.8 was inferred implying a strong electron-electron interaction with unknown origin. One can express \u03bb tot = \u03bb+\u03bb e , where \u03bb is the electron-phonon coupling constant and \u03bb e manifests the interactions due to the possible spin fluctuations and other electron-electron interactions. If we rewrite Eq. (2) as \u03b3 n = (1/3)k B \u03c0 2 N(E F )(1+\u03bb tot ) and assume the theoretical N(E F ) = 0.46 states/eV atom as achieved from the band structure calculations, then \u03bb tot = 1.53 can be obtained from the \u03b3 n = 19.15 (mJ/mol K 2 ) of present specific heat data.  Therefore, the resultant \u03bb e = \u03bb tot -\u03bb =1.53 -0.65=0.88 suggests a moderate electron-electron interaction in LiTi 2 O 4 , and is more consistent with a Stoner enhancement factor (1-S) -1~2 , which was derived from the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 = \u00b5 B 2 N(E F )/(1-S).

One would find that the T c of these superconductors does not strongly correlate with their structure, \u00e3 n , N(E F ), \u0398 D , and the electron-phonon coupling constant \u00eb.It is also evident that the superconductivity of each material occurs at only very narrow transition-metal composition.A small amount of metal substitution or a little off-stoichiometry for transition metal will dramatically suppress the superconductivity.Thus, the electronic properties of the transition metals Ti, Bi, Cu, and Ru must play an unique role on the occurrence of superconductivity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Magnetiza- tion measurements showed a single sharp superconduct- ing transition at T c \u2243 43 K and the saturation of the sus- ceptibility at low temperatures indicating the good sam- ple quality.   The \u00b5SR measurements were performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Switzerland) using low- momentum muons (29 MeV/c). A detailed discussion of the TF-\u00b5SR technique is given in where details of the application of the technique to the determination of \u03bb can be found. shows TF-\u00b5SR muon-spin precession signals in an applied field of 600 mT above and below T c .For vi- sualization purposes the apparent precession frequencies are modified from the actual precession frequencies by the use of a rotating reference frame.  In the normal state above T c , the oscillation shows a small relaxation due to random local fields from nuclear magnetic moments. Below T c , the relaxation rate strongly increases due to the inhomogeneous field distribution of the flux line lat- tice. It is well known that in n-type cuprates there is a competition between the antiferromagnetically ordered state and superconductivity . The static magnetism, if present, could enhance the muon depolarization rate and falsify the interpretation of the TF-\u00b5SR results.   We have therefore carried out zero-field (ZF) \u00b5SR experi- ments to determine whether such static magnetism exists in SLCO.Typical ZF-\u00b5SR spectra are shown in for temperatures above and below T c . The ZF relaxation is exponential with a small relaxation rate 0.149(4) \u00b5s \u22121 and 0.184(5) \u00b5s \u22121 at 50 and 2.5 K, respectively. Thus, there is no evidence for the static magnetism in SLCO down to 2.5 K.Moreover, the ZF relaxation rate is small and changes very little between 50 and 2.5 K.Therefore, the increase in TF relaxation rate below T c is attributed entirely to the vortex lattice."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We used two Gaussian model for analyzing our asymmetry time spectra: where A i represent the asymmetries of the two compo- nents, \u03c3 i the muon depolarization rates, B i the local magnetic fields at the muon sites, \u03b3=135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio and \u03d5 the initial phase. The solid lines in show the best fits to Eq. (1). The fit is statistically satisfactory (\u03c7 2 criterion), as can be seen qualitatively in . Analysis of the asymmetry time spectra showed that below T c in the present SLCO sample more than 80 % of the muons stop in the superconducting regions (first component).  In this regions the internal magnetic field is smaller than the external one because of the diamag- netic screening and the depolarization rate is much higher than in the normal state because of the flux-line lattice formation. The rest 20 % of the muons (second com- ponent) oscillate with a frequency nearly equal to that corresponding to the applied magnetic field with a much smaller depolarization rate. This signal is most probably coming from the muons stopping in the nonsupercon- ducting grain boundaries and other defects in the struc- ture and is often observed in polycrystalline HTS .

Present results show that the differences between the p-and n-type cuprates extend also to the superconducting state.  Namely, we observed that in n-type cuprates the superfluid density n s /m * is more than four times larger compared to p-type cuprates with the same T c .  Finally let us comment the temperature dependence \u03c3(T ) presented in . One can see that at low tem- peratures (below \u223c15 K) \u03c3(T ) is not constant and instead follows the linear temperature dependence.Usually a lin- ear low-temperature behavior of \u03c3(T ) is taken as an in- dication for a d-wave gap function with line nodes .  However, experience with p-type cuprates showed that the single crystals are required for conclusive determi- nation of the intrinsic temperature dependence of \u03c3 and hence of the \u03bb using \u00b5SR technique . Unfortunately, single crystals of SLCO are not available at present. Con- cerning the pairing symmetry in SLCO based on other experiments, we note that the recent tunneling exper- iments suggest strong-coupling s-wave pairing in SLCO . On the other hand, NMR spin-lattice relaxation and Knight shift measurements were found to be more con- sistent with the line-nodes gap .It remains to be un- derstood why different experimental techniques provide controversial results concerning the pairing symmetry in SLCO."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In the prototype M-1212 phase, i.e. CuBa 2 YCu 2 O 7-\u03b4 (Cu-1212), the excess oxygen atoms fill half of the perovskite-type positions such that the charge-reservoir Cu atom with surrounding oxygen atoms forms a square-planar CuO 4 polyhedron.  Octahedral coordination is possible as well, with excess oxygen atoms being located at either rock-salt position for, e.g. M = Tl , or perovskite position for, e.g. M = Ru , though the real structures deviate from the ideal ones: in Tl-1212 the oxygen site in the TlO layer is subject to large concentration of oxygen vacancies, while in Ru-1212 the RuO 6 octahedra are rotated such that the oxygen atom is slightly shifted from the ideal a-axis site. Another well-known example of the M-1212 phase with a rock-salt type MO 1\u00b1\u03b4 layer, i.e. Hg-1212 , exhibits even much larger oxygen deficiency than Tl-1212, such that the coordination polyhedron is considered as an O-Hg-O dumbbell.    The tetrahedral coordination polyhedron has been seen for three phases with M = Ga , Al and Co .Among these, Ga-1212 shows superconductivity up to \u223c70 K when properly doped with holes . Superconductivity in Al-1212 has been somewhat debated ; even in the positive case the onset temperature is low, i.e. 18 \u223c 30 K .The third phase, Co-1212, was synthesized in 1989 with the composition of CoSr 2 YCu 2 O 7+\u03b4 . The crystal structure of CoSr 2 YCu 2 O 7+\u03b4 was later reported by Huang et al. .    The charge reservoir of Co-1212 consists of zigzag chains of corner-linked CoO 4 tetrahedra that run diagonally relative to the perovskite base.Later this picture was further elaborated by careful ED and TEM studies that revealed the presence of an orthorhombic superstructure originating from a regular alternation of two zigzag chains that are mirror images of each other .Even though the Co-1212 phase has been well known for long, the first indication of superconductivity at \u223c30 K was revealed for it only very recently by Mochiku et al. .In the present communication we summarize our systematic work carried out independently of that of et al. on the effects of aliovalent Ca II -for-Y III substitution and high-oxygen-pressure annealing in CoSr 2 YCu 2 O 7+\u03b4 .The work resulted in finding of bulk superconductivity with T c up to 40 K."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In AlSr 2 HoCu 2 O 7 , Ca was found to enter either the Sr site or the Ho site depending on the synthesis condition: substitution of Sr ended up with a shortened c axis, whereas that of Ho resulted in a lengthened c axis."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Magnetization measurements were performed with a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design: MPMS-XL) in both field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) modes down to 5 K.

The HPO annealing was carried out in a cubic-anvil-type ultra-high-pressure apparatus at 5 GPa and 500 o C for 30 min. As an oxygen source, Ag 2 O 2 (that readily releases O 2 upon heating while decomposing via Ag 2 O to Ag) was utilized: Ag 2 O 2 was mixed with Co-1212 powder to a molar ratio of 1 : 2. XRD patterns for the HPO samples are shown in . Comparison with those for the AS samples (reveals that the HPO annealing had no effect on the phase purity of the samples. On the other hand, in where the lattice parameters are plotted for both the AS and the HPO samples, it is observed that upon HPO annealing the lattice drastically shrank along the b and c axes, whereas the a-axis parameter remained unchanged. As a consequence of the b-axis shrinkage, the degree of orthorhombic distortion decreases. We recognize the same from the fact that every pair of double peaks seen in the XRD pattern for the AS samples, e.g. 026 and 206, 136 and 316, 138 and 318, merges into a single peak after HPO annealings. This suggests that the CoO 4 tetrahedra have got broken as a consequence of the change in the oxygen amount/arrangement about the Co atom. For the HPO-annealed samples superconductivity appears with the transition temperature (T c ) up to 40 K (as determined at the onset of the diamagnetic signal) for the x = 0.3 sample.   The largest volume fraction of superconductivity (16 % from the ZFC data and 11 % from the FC data) is due to the x = 0.35 sample. In , we show the T c values for all the HPO samples as plotted against x.A bell-shape relation is seen.   In we have shown the \u03c7 vs. T curve for the x = 0.4 sample as an example.Now a question arises on the primary reason for the appearance of superconductivity in the HPO samples. To be able to reach the correct answer, we first investigated whether the pure high-pressure (HP) effect alone would induce superconductivity in the Ca-substituted CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 samples.As-synthesized powder with x = 0.4 was annealed without Ag 2 O 2 at 5 GPa and 500 o C for 30 min, i.e. under the condition otherwise the same as that employed for the HPO samples except that no excess oxygen source was added."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

On the other hand, the amount of Ag seen in the XRD pattern did not visibly increase as compared to that seen for the HPO sample. Therefore, it is likely that the weight/oxygen loss detected by TG upon N 2 annealing is primarily due to the Co-1212 phase itself.  This conclusion is supported by the magnetization data: upon annealing the HPO sample in N 2 not only superconductivity but also the magnetic transition characteristically seen for all the HPO samples around 150 K disappeared ). Note that the origin of the magnetic transition (manifested by the branching of the ZFC and FC magnetization curves) was left unaddressed yet, as the structure of the CoO 1+\u03b4 charge reservoir is not determined for the HPO samples. The second, smaller weight step in the TG curve about 300 o C well coincides with that seen for the decomposition of pure Ag 2 O .  We thus assign the second step for the decomposition of leftover Ag 2 O, i.e. y \u2248 0.4, and the first step only to the oxygen evolution from the Co-1212 phase, i.e. \u03b4 \u2248 0.4.As the final step of the present work we checked the optimum amount of Ag 2 O 2 used as a source of excess oxygen in the HPO annealing.  The first HPO treatments were all carried out with 50 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 .  Here we made ad hoc HPO annealings for the x = 0.4 sample using 25 and 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 .It was found that with 25 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 , the c axis decreased less as compared with the case of 50 mol-%. More importantly, the sample did not show superconductivity.  On the other hand, with 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 peaks due to Ag 2 O appeared in the XRD pattern for the HPO annealed sample. The annealed sample exhibited superconductivity with a lower T c value of 20 K than that of the HPO annealed product with 50 mol-% of Ag 2 O 2 (T c \u2248 35 K). It was thus revealed that the optimum amount of Ag 2 O 2 as an oxygen source for the HPO annealing is in the vicinity of 50 mol-%. Here it should also be noted that we annealed the two new HPO samples in a thermobalance in N 2 .   From the TG curves shown in Fig. together with that for the sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 we could see the following features: the second weight-loss step about 300 o C that we had previously assigned to the decomposition of leftover Ag 2 O was not seen at all for the HPO sample with 25 % Ag 2 O 2 (y \u2248 0), whereas it was more pronounced for that with 100 % Ag 2 O 2 (y \u2248 1.0) in comparison with the original HPO sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 (y \u2248 0.4). The amount of oxygen depleted from the Co-1212 phase in the first weight-loss step increased with increasing amount of Ag 2 O 2 used for the HPO annealing, i.e.  In conclusion, we have systematically clarified the influence of aliovalent Ca II -for-Y III substitution and high-pressure-oxygen annealing on the superconductivity of CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 (Co-1212) samples. It was found that at least up to x \u2248 0.4 Ca dissolves in the Co-1212 phase at the Y site.Within this range of Ca substitution the oxygen content of as-synthesized samples remained stoichiometric. Therefore we could assure that holes were gradually doped in the Co-1212 structure upon Ca substitution.The as-synthesized samples, however, were not superconductive, suggesting that the holes created by the divalent-for-trivalent substitution are trapped about the Co atom in the charge reservoir.The combination of Ca substitution and high-pressure-oxygen annealing was necessary to induce superconductivity in the Co-1212 phase.The highest T c obtained in the present study for the HPO-annealed x = 0.3 sample was \u223c40 K."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

It is thought that conductive carriers are confined two dimensionally in the FeAs layers and the carrier concentration can be increased by the substitution of O 2-by F -. The parent compound LaFeAsO is metallic and undergoes a structural phase transition at ~160 K and a magnetic phase transition at ~140 K. 2,3) The crystal structure changes from the tetragonal to orthorhombic, then the compound exhibits a spin density wave type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering.The structural distortion and the magnetic ordering are suppressed by the F substitution, resulting in the emergence of the superconductivity. Right after the discovery of the superconductivity in LaFeAsO 1-x F x , it was reported that the T c of LaFeAsO 0.89 F 0.11 shows large pressure effect and increases to a maximum of 43 K at 4 GPa, suggesting that the lattice contraction is effective in the enhancement of the T c of oxypnictide compounds. 4) Actually, RFeAsO (R = rare earth) having smaller R atom than La atom shows the T c over 50 K. 5,6) It is known that external pressure can control carrier concentration in CuO 2 plane of high-T c cupper oxides."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The sample was confirmed to be mostly composed of a single phase of the ZrCuSiAs-type tetragonal structure with lattice constants of a = 0.403268(1) nm and c = 0.874111(4) nm at room temperature. Electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 1.5 and 12 GPa were performed by a standard dc four-probe technique using a piston-cylinder type pressure cell and a cubic anvil cell, respectively. A liquid pressure-transmitting medium (Fluorinert FC70:FC77 = 1:1) was used to maintain hydrostatic conditions. A diamond anvil cell (DAC) made of CuBe alloy was used for electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 29 GPa.  The sample chamber comprising a rhenium gasket was filled with powdered NaCl as a pressure-transmitting medium. 4) AC magnetic susceptibility measurements with AC field of 1.8 mT and a frequency of 317 Hz were carried out using the cubic anvil cell. shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of LaFeAsO using the piston-cylinder type pressure cell.  The electrical resistivity of LaFeAsO shows a rapid decrease below ~150 K at 0 GPa. 1) This anomaly at ~150 K becomes broader with applying pressure. The temperature dependence of d\u03c1/dT shows a peak at 145 K at 0 GPa, and the peak of d\u03c1/dT shifts to lower temperature side by applying pressure, as shown in the inset of .From the results of powder X-ray diffraction measurement and nuclear magnetic resonance using the same batch sample as ours, it was reported that the structural phase transition from the tetragonal to the orthorhombic (Cmma) and the AFM ordering occur at ~165 and 142 K, respectively.   The temperature T 0 at which d\u03c1/dT shows the peak at 0 GPa is close to the AFM ordering temperature rather than the structural phase transition temperature. Therefore, the pressure dependence of the T 0 may be related to a suppression of the AFM ordering by applying pressure.Another remarkable anomaly of the electrical resistivity was observed under high pressure at lower temperatures.At 1.5 GPa, the electrical resistivity gradually decreases on cooling below ~10 K."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The temperature at which the electrical resistivity begins to decrease, indicated by arrows in (a), shifts to the lower temperature and the electrical resistivity at 0 T below the temperature indicated by the arrows increases by applying magnetic field.  The zero resistivity observed at 12 GPa disappears by increasing current density, as shown in . Thus, these results indicate that the sudden decrease of the electrical resistivity is reduced by applying magnetic field and by increasing current density.  Moreover, a diamagnetic signal of AC magnetic susceptibility is detected below ~20 K at 9 and 12 GPa, as shown in . In this way, the magnetic field and the current effects on the electrical resistivity and the diamagnetic signal strongly suggest that the anomalous behavior in the electrical resistivity below 20 K is attributed to a pressure-induced superconductivity.The broadening of the superconducting transition below ~20 K is probably due to a sample inhomogeneity rather than a distribution of pressure, because a hydrostatic condition was kept unchanged during the measurements.     The pressure-induced superconductivity have also been reported in Fe-As compounds having a ThCr 2 Si 2 -type tetragonal structure. The anomaly due to the pressure-induced superconductivity is also detected by the electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 29 GPa using the DAC, as shown in . In this measurement, the zero resistivity was not observed even in the highest pressure.The failure to observe the zero resistivity is probably caused by a nonhydrostatic compressive stress resulting from the use of a solid pressure-transmitting medium. We confirmed current dependence of the electrical resistivity below the transition temperature.  The transition temperature increases by applying pressure to a maximum of 21 K, and decreases monotonically above 16 GPa.(a) shows the pressure dependence of the characteristic temperature T 0 and the superconducting transition temperature T c . The T 0 monotonically decreases with increasing pressure.On the other hand, the T c increases to the maximum of 21 K at ~12 GPa, then deceases with further applying pressure.This P-T phase diagram shown in is similar to x-T phase diagram for the F -substituted system, LaFeAsO 1-x F x . 1) In addition, the pressure dependence of T c in LaFeAsO is similar to those observed in the F-doped compounds, as shown in .The substitution effect of O 2-by F -in LaFeAsO is expected to lead shrinkage of lattice constants and change of carrier density, resulting in suppression of structural and magnetic phase transitions and enhancement of T c."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Therefore, from the viewpoint of volume contraction, the F substitution is more effective in the suppression of structural and magnetic phase transitions and in the emergence of superconductivity than the external pressure effect. Moreover, LaFeAsO shows the lowest maximum T c in LaFeAsO 1-x F x series under high pressure.   The maximum T c of LaFeAsO 0.95 F 0.05 is rather lower value of 29 K under high pressure, compared with the maximum T c of 43 K under high pressure in LaFeAsO 0.89 F 0.11 and LaFeAsO 0.86 F 0.14 .This may be due to a magnetic instability existing close to superconducting phase.    On the other hand, the maximum T c of 43 K in \"over-doped\" LaFeAsO 0.86 F 0.14 is comparable to that in \"optimum-doped\" LaFeAsO 0.89 F 0.11 although the T c of LaFeAsO 0.86 F 0.14 at 0 GPa is smaller than that of LaFeAsO 0.89 F 0.11 by 9 K.This result is in strong contrast to the case of high-T c cupper oxides.In high-T c cupper oxides, external pressure effect has an aspect of carrier doping effect, because carrier concentration in the CuO 2 layers increases by pressure through changing charge 8 distribution due to anisotropic compression.In this case, the T c of \"over-doped\" LaFeAsO 0.86 F 0.14 decreases with increasing external pressure. 18) Therefore, it is considered that the effect of external pressure on the electronic state of Fe-based superconductors is different with the case of high-T c cupper oxides."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In par- ticular, a p s = 1/16 is observed. This p s = 1/16 corresponds to a previously reported critical hole concentration (p c ) which dictates the doping ef- ficiency and signals a chemical potential jump of the doped holes. This p c = 1/16 is also the point where superconductivity first appears in the phase diagram. In we present the onset T c vs. p curves of La 2\u2212x Sr x CuO 4+\u03b4 for x = 0, 0.015, and 0.05.  The T c is defined as the onset tem- perature of the Meissner effect.  The p of each sample series is varied precisely by small steps of \u2206p = 0.0025 \u223c 0.004 using electrochemical ox- idation to change the oxygen concentration, \u03b4.While a single 30K transition is observed for x = 0 samples, a dramatic increase of T c from \u223c 15K to \u223c 30K is clearly seen for both x = 0.015 and 0.05 samples. In particular, for the x = 0.015 sample it is remarkable to observe an almost dis- continuous jump from T c \u223c 16K to 26K by a very small change of carrier concentration \u2206p = 0.004 near p c . Since p c = 1/16 is a special carrier con- centration related to a possible electronic phase instability, far-infrared studies of the x = 0.015 sample at various p across p c provides a unique opportunity to investigate the specific role of this instability to the normal state charge dynamics and to the occurrence of the superconductivity in cuprates."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Therefore, the coexistence of a pinned CDW and metallic conductivity demands a channel for coherent charge transport. In order to defy all the scattering with the CuO 2 phonons, the free carriers must \"ride\" the density wave. In the case of a one-dimensional CDW, forma- tion of topological charged solitons (phase kinks) is a possibility. However, because of the topo- logical nature of the solitons, it requires that both soliton and antisoliton must hop to the neighboring CDW chains to transport charges. Therefore, the observed coherent charge trans- port will not take place through the soliton hop- ping mechanism. In the stripe model, each stripe in the CuO 2 plane is considered as a river of charge and conducting. Hence, no charge gap or pinned collective modes are expected.

We can now formally relate our low temperature results to the high temperature special carrier concentra- tion. It seems that this instability survives to low temperature and we suggest that all the doped holes in the CuO 2 plane are condensed to form a (4x4) square Wigner lattice with sides L = 4a (a = Cu-Cu distance). Then, the observed sharp Drude-like free-carrier conductivity in this insu- lating Wigner lattice ground state comes from the coherent charge transport of the excess holes \u2206p = p c \u223c 0.0005 per copper which corresponds to \u223c 0.8% of the total carriers in \u03b4 = 0.024 sam- ple. In order to achieve such a coherent trans- port of charges, the free-carriers must reside in a state where the scattering with the phonons of the CuO 2 lattice can be avoided. That is, the free carriers need to \"ride\" the Wigner lattice. In a square lattice model, when an excess hole is intro- duced to the Wigner lattice, it will find an ener- getically lowest location on the lattice. Because of the on-site Coulomb repulsion at the lattice sites, the minimum energy location would be the center of the square lattice. At this location, the excess hole seats in a local harmonic potential with a zero point energy. This hole now may move be- cause it \"sees\" a periodic harmonic potential in the directions of the neighboring identical energy minima. This causes the zero point energy of the excess holes to be broadened into a band with the width of which is density dependent. This band is gapped by the Coulomb interaction energy at the minimum energy site. For charge carriers in the Coulomb band, the main energy dissipation chan- nel for electrons is through the scattering with acoustic phonons of the Wigner lattice. At high temperatures, there exists possible promotion of holes from the Wigner lattice site to an intersti- tial position and vice versa. A similar idea of an interstitial band has been discussed by de Wette for a three-dimensional electron Wigner lattice. In this band picture, we anticipate two absorp- tion peaks in addition to the transition across the single particle excitation gap: One due to the transition (\u03c9 1 ) from the Coulomb band to the single particle excited state and the other in- volves the transition from the ground state to the Coulomb band (\u03c9 2 ). However, the \u03c9 2 transition from the ground state to the Coulomb band re- quires an energy across the gap less the Coulomb energy change in the lattice which is essentially the same as the static Coulomb energy difference between the occupied lattice site and the intersti- tial lattice site. We suggest that \u03c9 2 is of the order of \u223c 0.012 eV (\u223c 100 cm \u22121 ) as seen in the oxy- gen gas effusion experiments. This implies that the Coulomb energy difference between the occu- pied lattice site and the interstitial lattice site is \u223c 0.025 eV. Therefore, we identify the 90 cm \u22121 peak with \u03c9 1 with a full width W c \u223c 200 cm \u22121 (0.025 eV) and the Coulomb band gap is \u223c 300 cm \u22121 .

Using the experimentally estimated oscillator strengths, we found m * \u223c 170 m e at 300 K, \u223c 80 m e at 150 K and \u223c 60 m e at 30 K. This implies that the density waves develop the long- range order at T > 150 K by drawing its strength from the single particle excitations. We shall see later in the oscillator strength vs. T plot that the crossover occurs at T 0 \u223c 200 K. However, we believe that m* is underestimated from the experimental data because the measured reflec- tivity for frequencies above 400 cm \u22121 is less than true reflectivity due to the ceramic nature of the sample. In addition, symmetric band is assumed to take into account of the spectral weight above 0.5 eV. Fitting for each peak was made using a symmetric Gaussian function as an approxima- tion without taking into account of asymmetry. The Debye frequency (\u03c9 D ) of the Wigner lat- tice can be estimated within the harmonic ap- proximation as \u03c9 D \u2248 (e 2 /\u01eb 0 m * L 3 ) 1/2 \u223c 42 cm \u22121 (\u223c 7.8 x 10 12 s \u22121 ) which gives the Debye temper- ature (\u03b8 D ) of 60 K with \u01eb 0 \u223c 10, the static di- electric constant of the underlying CuO 2 lattice, and m * \u223c 60m e . Therefore, we expect the linear T-dependence down to 0.2\u03b8 D \u223c 12 K 29 since the main energy dissipation channel for electrons is the scattering with the acoustic phonons of the Wigner lattice. Through the oscillator strength calculation, we found only \u223c 0.42 % of the doped carriers are contributing to the Drude-like con- ductivity at T = 300 K which is consistent with the value estimated from the plasma frequency. This is 50% of the available free carriers at p = 0.063 doping. At 300 K, the other 50% may occupy the single particle excited states of the Wigner lattice that might contribute to the inco- herent background conductivity. The deviation from the linear T-dependence of the resistivity in under-doped cuprates is due to additional scat- tering with the lattice defects and domain bound- aries whose fluctuation is dynamic as the Wigner lattice formation is not complete at finite temper- atures. \u03c3 1 (\u03c9) of \u03b4 = 0.032 sample, which undergoes the superconducting transition at T c \u223c 26 K, is dis- played in .

Since we know that the \u03b4 = 0.032 sample is right at the fast transition region from a T c \u223c 15K state to a T c \u223c 30K state.It is plausible that the observed \u03c3 1 (\u03c9) of \u03b4 = 0.032 sample comes from two different contributions; one comes from the T c = 16 K phase (LT c ) seen in \u03b4 = 0.024 sample and the other from the T c = 30 K phase (HT c ).  Then, the two new features belong to HT c phase and have their origin in a different Wigner lattice ground state.We identify that the \u223c 46 cm \u22121 mode corresponds to the collective mode of this new Wigner lattice, \u03c9 GH ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

At 30 K, we find n H /n L \u223c 2, which sug- gests that the carrier concentration of HT c phase is twice of that of the LT c phase when we assume the same m*.

Two main re- markable changes are clearly seen; one is a rela- tively abrupt increase in the oscillator strength at \u223c 200 K, common to all the peaks and the other is a sharp jump in the strength of the Goldstone modes, \u03c9 GL and \u03c9 GH , at their respective super- conducting T c , one at 16 K and the other at 30 K.  The increase in the oscillator strength of the collective modes at 200 K, indicates that the long- range order of the Wigner lattice starts to develop as evidenced by the reduction in their dynamic mass. At the same time, the strength increase in the Coulomb band suggests that more carri- ers occupy the Coulomb band following the de- velopment of the long-range order of the Wigner lattice.The corresponding free-carrier oscillator strength changes from \u223c 0.42 % at 300 K to \u223c 0.97 % at 150 K and to \u223c 1.18 % at 30 K in \u03b4 = 0.024 sample indicates that all the available free carriers are now occupying the Coulomb band and participating in the charge transport at T below 200 K.  However, we do not observe the change in the free carrier plasma frequency because of the increasing static dielectric constant with de- creasing T. In \u03b4 = 0.032 sample, the free carrier strength is \u223c 0.44 % of the total carrier at 300 K and \u223c 0.71 % at 30 K. At the same time, as demonstrated above, at the crossover tempera- ture (T 0 \u223c 200 K) of the long-range order of the Wigner lattice, the free carriers in the Coulomb band start to form pairs. Subtle changes in the d\u03c1/dT vs. T curves of both \u03b4 = 0.024 and \u03b4 = 0.032 samples at \u223c 200K has already been pointed out (see ). The resistivity de- creases faster and faster upon cooling below 200 K. Therefore, we have normal state pairs of holes formed at 200 K in our cuprate system.It is interesting to note that 200 K is exactly the tem- perature when mobile excess oxygen is considered to be frozen in."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

It is surprising therefore to find superconductivity (SC) with T c = 43 K in the optimal electron-doped infinite-layer cuprates Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 (M = La, Gd), which exhibit only a 16% difference between the a and c tetragonal lattice parameters.   The structure of Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 is the most basic among all high-T c cuprates, consisting entirely of CuO 2 sheets separated by rare-earth (RE) ions with tetragonal lattice parameters c = 3.41\u00c5 and a = 3.95\u00c5. The recent success in producing high-quality polycrystalline samples of the infinite-layer cuprates with no observable impurity phases has en- gendered a renewed interest in these compounds.X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy indicate electron dop- ing, and bulk SC has been verified by powdered mag- netization (M ) measurements and specific heat (C) measurements (data presented later in this work). Sev- eral recent studies of these high purity polycrystalline samples suggest three-dimensional (3D) superconductiv- ity in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 .   Scanning tunnel spectroscopy (STS) measurements indicate an unconventional but isotropic s-wave superconducting gap with no pseudogap at zero field.   The s-wave symmetry of the gap is also sup- ported by specific heat measurements and Cu-site substi- tution studies,although it may be contradicted by NMR measurements. Kim et al estimated the c-axis coherence length (\u03be c ) from a Hao-Clem analysis of the reversible magnetization of grain-aligned poly- crystal, and found that \u03be c exceeds the spacing between the CuO 2 planes, indicating 3D superconductivity.On the other hand, they also find significant anisotropy be-tween magnetic fields H \u2264 5 T oriented parallel and per- pendicular to the CuO 2 planes, with an anisotropy ratio \u03b3 = \u03be c /\u03be ab = H ab c2 /H c c2 = 9.3, which is larger than \u03b3 = 5 observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 although much smaller than \u03b3 = 55 observed in optimally doped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8\u2212\u03b4 . It is interesting to note that the only ma- jor crystallographic difference between the a-b and the c directions in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is the presence of oxygen in the a-b plane, which allows coupling of adjacent Cu spins and has been implicated as the cause of antiferro- magntic ordering or spin fluctuations in other members of the high-T c cuprate family, as well as a possible mech- anism for superconducting pairing.The importance of the CuO 2 planes to the SC in Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 is further supported by the fact that Ni substitution on the Cu site rapidly suppresses T c whereas out-of-plane Gd substitu- tion on the Sr site leaves T c unchanged.In this work we determine the upper critical field H c2 and the irreversibility field H irr of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 by means of magnetization and penetration depth measure- ments in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T in order to directly investigate the degree of upper critical field anisotropy and the role of vortex fluctuations.We also present specific heat (C) and magnetization (M ) mea- surements in low DC fields to 6 T as a function of tem- perature (T ) of Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2, confirming the bulk co- existence of Gd paramagnetism (PM) and SC.Our re- sults suggest strong confinement of the spin pairing wave function to the CuO 2 planes and significant field-induced superconducting fluctuations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The irreversibility field H irr was identified from the onset of reversibility in the M (H) loops.

A ten turn 0.7 mm diameter aluminum coil was tightly wound around the sample with a filling factor of greater than 90%, with the coil axis oriented perpendicular to the pulsed field. To maintain temperature stability, the sample was thermally anchored to a sapphire plate and placed in 3 He exchange gas.

The inset shows the T -dependence of \u2206f in zero magnetic field. The nor- mal state resonant frequency f that is reached with in- creasing field can only be determined for T \u2265 30 K; for lower T the sample remains superconducting to 60 T so \u2206f is estimated. The frequency shift of the empty coil has been subtracted from all data. In applied fields, the SC transition is very broad, which can be attributed to the large anisotropy in H c2 of the randomly orientated grains in the polycrystal.  By contrast, the SC tran- sition as a function of T at H = 0 is very sharp, in- dicating a high quality sample. Therefore, the onset of diamagnetism with decreasing H in the \u03bb(H) data can be identified with the largest H c2 , H ab c2 for fields in the CuO 2 planes. The onset is defined as H where \u2206f > 5 kHz (\u2206\u03bb > 30 nm), just above the noise of the exper- iment. Different onset criteria have only minor effects on the determination of H ab c2 , as shown in where H ab c2 using an onset criteria of 10 kHz and 20 kHz are shown as open circles and diamonds, respectively. The upper critical field H ab c2 is linear in T up to the H = 60 T maximum of the experiment, and extrapolates to 153 T at zero temperature. (Although if we assume the typ- ical Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg curvature for an or- bitally limited superconductor, 153 T would consti- tute an upper limit for H ab c2 ). The linearly extrapolated value of 153 T is close to the s-wave Pauli paramagnetic limit of H p c2 = \u2206 \u221a 2\u00b5B = 159 T, where \u2206 = 13 meV has been determined independently from STS data. This raises the possibility of spin-limited superconduc- tivity for H in the plane, which has also been observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4. Determination of the critical fields for H along the c- axis, H c c2 , from these data on noncrystalline samples is more difficult.  However, at fields below the onset of dia- magnetism we do observe a significant change in slope of the \u03bb(H) data, indicated as H kink in .The H kink vs T curve is shown in and extrapolates to 12 T at zero temperature. This value of H kink (T = 0) is close to H c c2 = 14 T determined from a Hao-Clem analysis men- tioned previously. [5] We therefore associate H kink with H c c2 . In \u03bb(H) measurements of a noncrystalline sample, a change in slope near H c c2 could be expected since the number of grains in the polycrystal that are supercon- ducting varies with H for H c c2 < H < H ab c2 , whereas for H < H c c2 the entire sample is superconducting, yield- ing different H dependencies of the flux expulsion in these two regions. Our data yield an anisotropy ratio \u03b3 = dH ab c2 dT / H c c2 dT \u223c 8, roughly in agreement with \u03b3 = 9.3 determined from low field studies. In penetration depth measurements of single crys- talline organic superconductors for H along the conduct- ing planes, a kink below H c2 for fields has been asso- ciated with the vortex melting transition. However, in this work we have determined the vortex dynamics separately by means of magnetization measurements in pulsed fields, and we find a significant difference be- tween the onset of irreversibility in M (H), H irr , and H kink as shown in . Following similar arguments for the \u03bb(H) measurements, we note that H ab irr > H c irr in cuprate superconductors, therefore we assign the on- set of irreversibility for polycrystalline Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 to H ab irr .  Although we can't rule out the possibility that H kink might be associated with a vortex phase trans- formation, the fact that H kink (T \u2192 0) saturates, and H kink (T \u2192 0) << H ab c2 (T \u2192 0) indicates that H kink (T ) is unlikely caused by a thermally-induced vortex melt- ing transition for H||ab.  Future pulsed-field measure- ments on grain-aligned or epitaxial thin film samples will be necessary to conclusively determine whether H kink (T ) obtained in this work may be identified with H c c2 (T ). The region between H ab irr and H ab c2 in the phase dia- gram in is significantly larger than is observed in other electron-doped high-T c compounds where H c2 typically tracks H irr .It is particularly surpris- ing that H ab irr (T \u2192 0) \u223c 45 T is much smaller than H ab c2 (T \u2192 0) \u223c 150 T. In hole-doped cuprates, a large separation between H irr and H c2 is often observed and is generally referred to as a vortex-liquid phase due to thermally induced fluctuations.  The large discrepancy between H ab irr and H ab c2 in e-doped Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 even to T \u2192 0 suggests the presence of field-enhanced SC fluc- tuations in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 . Enhanced SC fluctuations down to very low T may be consistent with a scenario of SC coexisting with a competing order, such as a spin- density wave (SDW) near a quantum critical point. In particular, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations associ- ated with the competing SDW can be enhanced by ex- ternal fields.  The conjecture of a competing order in the SC state of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is also consistent with our recent STS studies, where we observe the emergence of a second energy gap with increasing tunnelling current upon the closing of the SC gap. In con- trast to the SC gap, the current-induced gap is not spa- tially uniform probably due to interactions of the SDW with charge disorder. We note that experimental evidence for coexistence of a SDW with cuprate super- conductivity has been found in other high-T c compounds. To further investigate the dimensionality of the super-conductivity, low-field C(T ) and M (T, H) of polycrys- talline Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2 were measured with H up to 6 T and T down to 1.8 K in a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System and a SQUID magne- tometer, respectively.In contrast to in-plane Ni substi- tution on the Cu site, out of plane Gd substitution on the Sr site does not suppress T c . In fact, the Gd ions exhibit local moment paramagnetism (PM) that coexists with SC to low T . shows M (H) at T = 5 K, and zero field/field cooled magnetization curves as a function of T in the inset.The M (H) curve in the main figure can be viewed as a superposition of a SC hysteresis curve and a Brillouin function resulting from the PM of Gd.Further proof for this coexistence is evident in the inset, which shows a large positive magnetization asso- ciated with Gd paramagnetism, but nevertheless signifi- cant hysteresis between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled curves, indicating superconductivity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The in plane upper criti- cal field H ab c2 extrapolates close to the Pauli paramagnetic limit H P c2 = 159 T, suggesting possible spin limiting for this orientation, as has been observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 .  There is a large separation between H ab c2 and the irre- versibility field H ab irr , which extends down to T \u2192 0, and is abnormal for electron doped high-T c cuprates. This suggests the existence of field-induced superconducting spin fluctuations perhaps due to a competing SDW. In spite of the significant anisotropy in the upper critical fields, \u03be c is longer than the spacing between CuO 2 planes, indicating three-dimensionality of the orbital wave func- tion. The low-field thermodynamic measurements of M (T ) and C(T ) for Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2 polycrystals indi- cate a coexistence of bulk SC with Gd paramagnetism, with the full J = 7/2 Hund's rule moment despite the close proximity of Gd atoms to the CuO 2 planes, and a T c of 43 K in both Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2 and Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2.

Our intuitive explanation as to why all the M-1222 materials (M 5+ ) are SC is discussed in Ref. 4.  Assuming that Mo is pentavalent, we may apply the same model to the Mo-1222 materials. In the well-established phase diagram for La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 , the parent La 2 CuO 4 is AFM and insulating and replacing Sr 2+ for La 3+ varies the hole density p. In Mo-1222 (Sr 2+ , Cu 2+ and O 2-), Ce is tetravalent 5 and our Mossbauer spectroscopy (MS) study performed at RT on 151 Eu, shows a singlet with an isomer shift of 0.04(2) mm/s (relative to Eu 2 O 3 ), indicating that the Eu is trivalent.   Given that Mo is pentavalent, a straightforward valence count yields a fixed oxygen concentration of 10. Thus, we argue that the MoSr 2 EuCeCu 2 O 10 sample serves as the parent compounds (similar to La 2 CuO 4 ).Hole doping of the Cu-O planes, which results in SC, can be achieved with increasing of the R 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio (R 3+ ions are replaced for Ce 4+ ) and indeed, MoEu 1.5 Ce 0.5 Sr 2 Cu 2 O 10-\u03b4 is SC. The optimal doping of Ce is now under investigation.  (C) Antiferromagnetism in the MoSr 2 R 1.5 Ce 0.5 Cu 2 O 10 (R=Ho-Lu and Y).  The ZFC and FC curves of Mo-1222R (R=Y, Er and Tm) measured at 5 -10 Oe, are presented in Fig. 3. One definitely sees the irreversibility and the peaks in the ZFC plots, typical of AFM ordering.We define T N (Table 1) as the merging point of these branches or, alternatively, as the i nflection point in the d\u03c7(T)/dT of the FC curve.  Similar behavior was observed for R=Ho and Lu.For R=Yb, no irreversibility is obtained and T N =16 K was defined as the kink observed in both ZFC and FC curves.  All M(H) curves measured below and above T N are linear up to 5 T and no hystersis is observed. Above T N , the \u03c7(T) curve for Mo-1222Y follows the CW law, and provides useful information on the Mo valence.Taking into account the existence (of about 5-6%) of the SrMoO 4 phase and by subtracting the Cu contribution (see above) we obtained P eff =1.68 \u00b5 B a value which is in good agreement with 1.73 \u00b5 B expected for Mo 5+ (4d 1 , S=0.5).Therefore, we argue with high confidence, that the prominent feature shown in , as well as the SC state described above, are related to the Mo 5+ sublattice.This preferable interpretation, which invokes analogy to the Ru-1222 system, means that the Mo layers are AFM ordered at relatively low temperatures (13-26 K)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Note the negative \u03b8 obtained which is consistent with an AFM order. For R=Tb and Dy, the \u03c7(T) curves have a PM-like behavior down to 5 K.  For R= Dy, the small contribution of the Mo AFM signal, (0.2 emu/mol Oe for R=Y see Fig. 5 inset), is probably masked by the high PM susceptibility of Dy 3+ . The P eff value obtained fits well the expected value of Dy 3 .  For R=Tb, P eff = 8.7 \u00b5 B deduced, is smaller than the 9.72 \u00b5 B expected for free ion Tb 3+ , suggesting that Tb has an intermediate valence-state, which also affects its magnetic behavior.This is reminiscent of the exception of the non-SC Tb123, among all other R123 materials.  (D) The MoSr 2 Gd 1.5 Ce 0.5 Cu 2 O 10 sample.  This sample shows two magnetic transitions at 11 K and at 184 K and positive \u03b8 (Fig. 4). The M(H) curves are linear and no hystersis is observed. At 5 K, for H> 3 T a tendency toward PM saturation (of Gd ions) is obtained. No magnetic transition is observed down to 1.8 K (Fig 4 inset).This is in contrast to Gd123, M-1212 (M=Ru and Mo) and Ru-1222 in which Gd is AFM ordered at 2.2-2.6 K.  (I) We may suggest that the peak at 11 K is related to the Gd sublattice and the highest transition i s due to the Mo layers. (II) A more preferable interpretation is that both transitions are related to the Mo sublattice, whereas the origin of the second one is not known yet.  Our supporting evidence is the fact, that in MoSr 2 GdCeCu 2 O 10 (Gd/Ce=1) both anomalies are absent (Fig. 4), suggesting that the two magnetic transitions are connected to each other. The PM values extracted for MoSr 2 GdCeCu 2 O 10 are:\u03b8= -4.4 K and P eff = 7.85 \u00b5 B /Gd which fits well the theoretical value of 7.94 \u00b5 B /Gd. At the present moment we cannot explain as to why the R=Gd sample behaves so differently from all the rest of the heavy Mo-1222R compounds. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the behavior of Mo-1222 system is entirely different from Ru 5+ -1222 one.In Mo-1222 (Mo 5+ ), the physical state depends strongly on the ionic radii of the R ionst.  For large R ions, the samples are PM ). Once the a lattice parameter is contracted, SC in the CuO 2 planes is induced at T C ~ 20 K. Further contraction of a leads to an AFM order (at T N 13-26 K) in the Mo-O layers and to suppression of SC.The SC and AFM (which compete each other) states depend on the R/Ce ratio and both disappear for R/Ce=1.The magnetic behavior of the Gd sample is different.Neutron diffraction as well as MS on 155 Gd studies, are now being carried out to determine the magnetic structure of this system."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The first superconductor in the family of pyrochlore oxides was discovered in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 at T c = 1.0 K. 2-4) Recently, we found another type of pyrochlore oxides with the general formula AB 2 O 6 called the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxide, 5) where A is a large monovalent alkaline metal cation. Two osmates, RbOs 2 O 6 and KOs 2 O 6 , have been prepared in this family, which exhibit superconductivity at higher T c 's of 6.3 K and 9.6 K, respectively. 5,6) They crystallize in a modified pyrochlore structure, where Os atoms form a corner-sharing tetrahedral network called the pyrochlore lattice, as in A 2 B 2 O 7 -type pyrochlore oxides which is now called \u03b1-pyrochlore, while alkaline metal atoms occupy the 8b site which is the O' site in the \u03b1-pyrochlore.Here we report on the discovery of another new \u03b2-pyrochlore oxide superconductor CsOs 2 O 6 .        A polycrystalline sample was prepared using conventional solid-state reaction method in an evacuated silica tube.To control the oxygen partial pressure, a certain amount of AgO was added separately from the pellet in the tube: AgO decomposes into silver and oxygen above 370 K, and thus generates an oxidizing atmosphere.The chemical composition of the product examined by the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis in a scanning electron microscope was Cs:Os ~ 1:2. shows a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern taken at room temperature.All the intense peaks can be indexed assuming a cubic unit cell with a lattice constant a = 1.0149 nm.A few extra peaks from Os are detected.Moreover, a trace of unknown impurity phase is also included in the product.Extinctions observed in the XRD pattern are consistent with the space group of m Fd3 , and the intensity profile is similar to the other \u03b2-pyrochlore oxides.

Further- more, it was found that in rare earth (RE) and Sr co-doped La 2 CuO 4 , such as La 1.28 Nd 0.6 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 , the phonon thermal conductivity is much more enhanced in the non-superconducting LTT (low-temperature tetrag- onal) phase, compared to that in LSCO with the same Sr content. This cannot happen if the defect scattering and electron scattering of phonons are the only source of the peak suppression.   Based on the fact that in RE-and Sr-doped La 2 CuO 4 systems the phononic thermal con- ductivity is always strongly suppressed in superconduct- ing samples, it was proposed that dynamical stripes cause a pronounced damping of phonon heat transport, while static stripes do not suppress the phonon trans- port so significantly.It is indeed possible that the static stripes are not effective in scattering phonons, if they only induce periodic local distortions in the crystal structure. Since the spin stripes in lightly doped LSCO (x = 0.01 -0.05) are reported to be static, one may naively expect that the phonon heat transport is not strongly suppressed in such lightly doped LSCO.However, there has been no measurement of the thermal conductivity of lightly doped LSCO single crystals."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The tem- perature dependences of the thermal conductivity mea- sured along the ab plane and the c axis in pure La 2 CuO 4 are shown in , which also contains data for LSCO and LCZO single crystals.  For undoped La 2 CuO 4 sam- ple, a sharp peak appears at low temperature, at \u223c25 K in \u03ba ab (T ) and at \u223c20 K in \u03ba c (T ), respectively. In the c direction, above the peak temperature, \u03ba c de- creases with increasing T approximately following 1/T dependence, which is typical for phonon heat transport. This phonon peak originates from the competition be- tween the increase in the population of phonons and the decrease in their mean free path (due to the phonon- phonon umklapp scattering) with increasing tempera- ture. In contrast to the mainly phononic heat trans- port in the c direction, in the ab plane another large and broad peak develops at higher temperature (\u223c270 K), which has been attributed 18 to the magnon trans- port in a long-range-ordered AF state. The heat con- duction due to magnetic excitations has been observed in many low-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets, such as one-dimensional spin systems CuGeO 3 , 21,23,25 Sr 2 CuO 3 , 26 SrCuO 2 , 27 and (Sr,Ca) 14 Cu 24 O 41 , and also two-dimensional antiferromagnet K 2 V 3 O 8 .    The ab- sence of this high-T peak in \u03ba c (T ) is obviously due to the much weaker magnetic correlations in the c direction compared to that in the CuO 2 plane.All these behav- iors in undoped La 2 CuO 4 are consistent with the previ- ously reported data. It is worthwhile to note that the phononic peak value of \u03ba c (27 W/Km) is considerably larger than that of \u03ba ab (16 W/Km).One possible reason for this difference is that the phonon heat transport is intrinsically easier along the c axis, which is not so easy to conceive in view of the layered crystal structure of La 2 CuO 4 . Another, more likely possibility is that there exists phonon-magnon scattering in the ab plane that causes additional damping of the phonon peak.Such scattering may also happen in the c axis, however, it should be much weaker than in the ab plane because it is well known that the magnons are good excitations only for the in-plane physics in the La 2 CuO 4 system."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

First, it is important to notice that the low-T phonon peak in \u03ba ab is suppressed slightly more quickly by Zn doping than by Sr doping. In the impurity-scattering scenario, it is difficult to con- ceive that the phonons are scattered more strongly in LCZO than in LSCO, because the atomic mass differ- ence between Cu and Zn is much smaller than that be- tween La and Sr.  In addition, the contribution of the phonon-carrier scattering, which exists only in LSCO, would cause the phonon peak in LSCO to be suppressed more quickly than in LCZO. Thus, the difference between the Sr-doping dependence and the Zn-doping dependence in \u03ba ab (T ) at low temperature, which is opposite to the naturally expected trend, suggests that there are addi- tional scatterers of phonons in the Zn doped samples.  It is most likely that the additional scatterers in LCZO are of magnetic origin; magnons, which cause the high- temperature peak in LCZO, are an obvious candidate, and the magnetic disordering around Zn atoms may also cause some scattering of phonons through magnetoelastic coupling.It is useful to note that, as we mentioned in section III A, magnons are likely to be already responsi- ble for the relatively small phonon peak in \u03ba ab (compared to that in \u03ba c ) in pure La 2 CuO 4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

If the charges also form static stripes together with the spins, they cer- tainly cause local lattice distortions. Even if the charges do not conform to the static stripe potentials set by the spins, the spin stripes themselves may well cause local lattice distortions due to the magnetoelastic coupling; 33 this direct coupling between the spin stripes and the local lattice distortions is in fact very likely, because recently Lavrov et al. found that the spin-lattice coupling is very strong in lightly doped LSCO.  It should be noted that the local lattice distortions due to static stripes are not expected to scatter phonons when the stripes induce only static and periodic modulation of the lattice (which is in fact a kind of superlattice); however, possible disordering of stripes in the c direction can introduce rather strong scattering of phonons in this direction. In fact, because of the weak magnetic correlations along the c axis, the stripes in neighboring CuO 2 planes are only weakly cor- related or even uncorrelated, which is best evidenced by the very short magnetic correlation length \u03be c in the stripe phase (usually smaller than the distance between neigh- boring CuO 2 planes) in the lightly doped LSCO. We can further discuss the possible role of static stripes in the suppression of the phonon peak in \u03ba ab of lightly doped LSCO. Although the stripes are much better or- dered in the ab plane than in the c direction, 6,7 there are two reasons that phonons in the ab plane are possi- bly scattered by the stripes.  First, the static spin stripes were reported to be established at about 30 K to 17 K for x = 0.01 to 0.04 by the neutron measurements.These temperatures are very close to the position of the phonon peak .  Near the stripe freezing tem- perature, local lattice distortions are expected to be well developed and yet are slowly fluctuating (or disordered), which would tend to scatter phonons. Second, there is no evidence until today that well periodically-ordered static charge stripes are formed in lightly doped LSCO; instead, our charge transport data strongly suggest that the charge stripes exist in a liquid (or nematic) state. 14 Such disordered state of charge stripes would tend to scatter phonons.Thus, it is possible that the static stripes also contribute to the scattering of phonons in the in-plane heat transport in LSCO, although their effect appears to be much weaker than that in the c direction."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

We found that the Zn substitution induces unusual carrier localization at low temperatures in a \"clean\" sys- tem with k F l > 5, where l is the mean free path and k F is the Fermi wave number. This observation strongly suggests that the local destruction of the AF correlation by Zn-doping can severely and qualitatively affect the charge transport in cuprates; therefore, the AF correla- tion in the CuO 2 plane seems to be indispensable to the peculiar metallic normal-state charge transport. There are two different Cu sites in YBCO, the chain site Cu(1) and the plane site Cu(2); when Zn is doped to YBCO, it is reported that Zn replaces mostly Cu(2) atoms, leaving the carrier density unchanged . NMR measurements have revealed that nonmagnetic Zn in- duces local magnetic moment by causing a spin \"hole\" in the AF background of the Cu spins .  This local moment gives rise to a Curie term in the magnetic sus- ceptibility at low temperatures .

In this transition, Cooper pairs are conjectured to localize in the presence of disor- der ; Zn in this case is considered to introduce dis- order potentials in the usual sense, though the scatter- ing from Zn is maximally large (unitarity limit) .Specifically, the S-I transition in YBCO takes place at around 400 \u00b5\u2126cm in single crystals (a larger critical value of 750 \u00b5\u2126cm is reported for thin films )."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Note that the three samples have the same oxygen content of 6.70. In zero field, all the samples are metal- lic (d\u03c1/dT \u22650) and show superconductivity. We can see in Fig. that the effect of Zn-doping in zero field is to reduce T c and simply add some constant residual resistiv- ity (thereby shifting up the \u03c1 ab (T ) curve), as is already reported in the literature. Thus, there is no qualitative difference among the three samples in the zero-field prop- erties. However, under a high magnetic field of 18 T, a drastic difference emerges; z=2.7% sample shows a clear upturn in \u03c1 ab at low temperatures, while other samples with smaller z do not show such clear upturn.  We also prepared a slowly-cooled sample to check if the observed localization behavior (d\u03c1/dT <0) in the z=2.7% sample is due to oxygen disorder; essentially the same localization behavior is observed in the slowly-cooled sample, which is supposed to have smaller amount of oxygen disorder (at the expense of transition width). Thus, for the oxygen content of 6.70, we may conclude that 2.7% of Zn induces carrier localization in YBCO at low temperatures in 18 T, irrespective of the annealing procedure.

Inset: \u03c1 ab (T ) in 0 and 15 T for y=6.70, z=2.3% sample and y=6.80, z=2.7% sample.  The evolution of \u03c1 ab (T ) with changing oxygen content for z=2.3% is shown in the main panel of Fig. . For this Zn concentration, the charge transport has much weaker tendency towards localization; even y=6.60 sample shows only a slight upturn in 15 T.  When the oxygen content is further reduced to 6.50, \u03c1 res exceeds the critical value for the S-I transition and \u03c1 ab (T ) shows an insulating be- havior already in zero field. Comparison between the z=2.7% samples (Fig. ) and the z=2.3% samples (Fig. ) lead to the conclusion that the tendency toward car- rier localization in the high-field normal state becomes much stronger when the Zn concentration is increased from 2.3% to 2.7%.Note that there is no drastic dif- ference between the z=2.7% samples and the z=2.3% samples if we only look at the zero-field data.  Now let us discuss the possible origin of the unusual localization behavior. What we observed in Zn-doped YBCO has strong similarities to the unusual localization behavior found in underdoped LSCO : In both systems, the localization behavior takes place in a region of \"clean\" charge transport where k F l is larger than 5; the temperature dependence of the resistivity is consis- tent with log(1/T ) and the size of the increase in resistiv- ity is larger than what is expected from weak localization; the localization behavior shows up at low temperatures only when the superconductivity is suppressed with high magnetic fields. Therefore, it is naturally expected that the localization behaviors observed in the two systems have a common origin. When we look for some common features in the underlying electronic/magnetic structures of the two systems, we hit on the fact that, as mentioned earlier, both systems have some kind of \"defects\" to the AF correlation in the CuO 2 planes; LSCO system is likely to have dynamical charge stripes which separate AF do- mains, while the Zn impurity in YBCO system acts like a point-like defect in the AF correlation.Note that both the dynamical charge stripes and the Zn-substitution ef- fect are most strongly seen at excitations with wave vec- tors near q=(\u03c0, \u03c0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

If so, the charge in cuprates may be carried by a quasipar- ticle which is closely related to the AF correlation, and a local disturbance of the AF correlation, in the presence of a high magnetic field, may strongly scatter the quasi- particle and brings about the unusual charge localization.

To our knowledge this was so far the first case that a p-type cuprate superconductor shows the Cu-O-Cu distance in the [CuO2] plane larger than 3.90 \u00c5. It is once more an indication of the uniqueness of oxyhalide superconductors in comparing with the pure copper oxide HTS. Some compounds with the same 0201-type or similar structure (1201-type) exhibited insulating properties , which have larger a-axis than 3.90\u00c5 and contained large oxygen vacancy (20-75%) in the [CuO2] plane, resulting in the imperfect [CuO2] layers.  In contrast, the Rietveld refinements shown in suggests that the 0201-type Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y contained few oxygen vacancies, indicating that the [CuO2] sheet is rather perfect. So in order to induce superconductivity in the Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y samples, the key point is how to dope appropriate amount of mobile carriers into the [CuO2] sheets which should be perfect and keep the chemical stoichiometry.In addition, the energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis revealed that the average atomic ratio of Sr:Cu:Cl over tens of well grown grains was basically in agreement with the suggested Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl y formula.  At the same time, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction investigation on a large amount of crystals of the samples did not show the trace of other phases with the similar K 2 NiF 4 structure .So it is inferred that the observed 30 K bulk superconductiv- ity is caused by the apical oxygen doped Cl-0201 phase Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

However, even after the appearance of the theory, continuous discoveries of new superconducting materials with higher transition temperatures (T c ) have made the field attractive owing to the expectations of a new theory as well as new materials having higher T c .  Therefore, the discovery of the superconductivity on magnesium diboride (MgB 2 ) has also induced enormous studies to clarify the superconducting (SC) transition mechanism because it has the highest T c among inter metallic superconductors and has even higher T c than some of the cuprate superconductors with locating the T c close to the upper limit predicted by the BCS theory . It is now generally accepted that MgB 2 has a multiple SC gap , originating in the two types of Fermi surface sheets with very different character, which simultaneously plays an important role for the high T c .     Theoretically, a possibility of the multiple SC gap was proposed more than 40 years ago in terms of \"two-band superconductivity\". However, further experimental verification is essential for complete understanding of this unique superconductor.Here, we show carbon-substitution dependence of the two gap of MgB 2 with the \"sub-meV\" resolution photoemission spectroscopy (PES). The result clearly shows two gaps and different substitution dependence for the two gaps.These results shed another light on to the two-band superconductivity in MgB 2 , and also suggest a new road to explore the higher T c material. MgB 2 has two layers consisted of boron and magnesium respectively . The first-principles calculations have indicated that MgB 2 is a band metal, where four bands are crossing Fermi level (E F ).  Two of them originate in the boron 2p \u03c3 orbital with a two-dimensional character, named \u03c3 band, and the other two do in the boron 2p \u03c0 one with a three-dimensional character, named \u03c0 band.The calculated band structure is consistent with experimental one, e.g. obtained from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy .At this stage, the transition mechanism is explained by the electron-phonon coupling , where the coupling strength depends on the symmetry of the Fermi surface.This scenario, based on the two-band model or, in more detail, k-dependent BCS theory or known as Eliashberg theory , has succeeded in explaining the multiplicity of the SC gap qualitatively and the T c quantitatively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The result is different from the present one. The x dependence of T c shown on by a solid line seems very similar to that of the larger gap in contrast to that of the smaller gap.  The similar x dependence of the larger gap and T c means the reduced gap 2\u2206/k B T c , which is a measure of coupling strength between the SC electron, is independent to x.

Lastly, we would like to comment on an implication for T c from the two-band model. The multi band model gives T c by D is the Debye temperature and \u03bb is the total coupling constant given by If the interband coupling constants are zero, T c is completely governed by \u03bb \u03c3\u03c3 . However, if the interband coupling is not zero, T c will always become larger than the case of \u03bb \u03c3\u03c0 \u03bb \u03c0\u03c3 = 0.   Thus the role of the interband coupling is to make T c higher than the case without interband coupling.In the present case, using obtained parameters, T c is estimated to be pushed up about 5 K by the interband coupling. Normally, it is believed that a larger electron-phonon coupling necessary for an increase of T c gives rise to another transition making the system insulating. In MgB 2 , the existence of the \u03c0 band may play some role for preventing such an instability occurring at the \u03c3 band with the strong electron-phonon coupling and allow \u03c3 band to become a strong coupling superconductivity at higher T c .

Until superconductivity was found in electron doped cuprates 1) the initial research efforts focused on hole doped cuprate systems.  When electron doped cuprates are synthesized, an annealing process is necessary in order to induce superconductivity since the as-grown sample contains non-stoichiometric oxy- gen. This annealing process is performed under reducing atmospheres, e.g., Ar or vacuum.  The reduction process causes severe modifications in the electronic structure, e.g., at optimal doping levels, the in-plane resistivity is modified from insulating to metallic and superconducting behavior.Moreover, angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data of optimally doped, as-grown Pr 1:85 -Ce 0:15 CuO 4 samples have shown that antiferromagnetic (AF) order exists, resulting in a leading edge gap along the nodal direction.  However, after the application of a reduction process, the long-range AF order is suppressed and the leading edge gap is filled up.Hence, the reduction process does neither inject carriers nor modify the band dispersion, in contrast to general assumptions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

However, the annealing process has been performed rather arbitrarily thus the resulting superconducting phase diagram of electron doped cuprates is inconclusive. When the annealing con- ditions are optimized for a given cerium substitution level, samples with low substitution levels, i.e., Pr 1:96 Ce 0:04 CuO 4 , become superconducting.  It has been pointed out 7) that the annealing parameters, i.e., time, temperature, and atmos- phere, need to be altered upon a variation of the Ce substitution level. Recently, we have shown that super- conductivity can be induced even in the extreme limit of dopant-free RE 2 CuO 4 (RE = rare earth). These results unambiguously expose the electronic ground state of square- planar coordinated cuprates as a superconductor rather than an antiferromagnetic insulator. Beside the synthesis conditions of T 0 -cuprates, the annealing conditions also are thermodynamically constraint in order to avoid the formation of decomposition products, e.g., (Nd,Ce) 2 O 3 and Cu 2 O. 14,15) Idemoto et al. investi- gated the thermodynamic stability region of Nd 2\u00c0x Ce x CuO 4 and observed an extended stability range for higher Ce 4\u00fe concentrations.   Consequently, the thermodynamic boundary conditions during the reduction process are less stringent for doped than for dopant-free samples.Moreover, any additional atom species in a system increases the entropy during crystallization thus leading to a higher defect con- centration level as compared to dopant-free sample. Since the annealing process is a diffusion driven process where oxygen atoms move along the CuO 2 planes and along the grain boundaries of the crystal, many parameters have to be taken into account in order to optimize the annealing process. Thin film samples show a significantly larger surface-to-volume ratio compared to bulk powder or single crystal samples, thus they are more viable for timesaving tuning of the annealing parameters.Here, we report on the superconducting states of optimally doped Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 and dopant-free Nd 2 CuO 4 using thin film specimens."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

In both cases, the films are grown fully relaxed onto the (001) SrTiO 3 substrates. From the RSM, in-plane lattice constants of 3.954 A for Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 and 3.940 A for Nd 2 CuO 4 are estimated.  Consequently, doping into the CuO 2 plane takes place in Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 since the Cu-O bond length increased despite the substitution of Nd 3\u00fe (r VIII \u00bc 1:109 A) by Ce 4\u00fe (r VIII \u00bc 0:97 A). 22) The c-axis lengths shrink upon the substitution from 12.126 to 12.082 A for Nd 2 CuO 4 and Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 , respectively.The shrinkage of the c-axis upon cerium substitution is easily seen by comparing the -2 X-ray diffraction patterns in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b).   Our superior sample quality is further supported by the appearance of a sharp (0014) reflection ) in contrast to samples prepared by other methods, such as pulsed laser deposition technique. In Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), the resistivity as a function of temperature is plotted.For Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 , the super- conducting transition appears at 24 K whereas it is 25 K for Nd 2 CuO 4 at 0 H \u00bc 0 T. We would like to mention that for the Nd 2 CuO 4 [] sample a sharp resistivity drop appears at 27 K; however, the resistivity is still finite between 25 and 27 K.  This is also consistent with our magnetization measurements, where the Meissner signal appears at 25 K.   Moreover, the absolute resistivity value at 40 K is significantly higher for Nd 2 CuO 4 than for Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 . At present we may not be able to provide a conclusive answer on the differences of the absolute resistivity values.A high resistivity value might be attributed to a inhomogeneous oxygen distribution in Nd 2 CuO 4, i.e., excessively and/or insufficiently reduced portions of the samples coexist.Film partitions in proximity to or at the surface therefore might be reduced in excess (even regular oxygen sites are evacuated) and partitions close to the substrate interface might be close to the stoichiometric amount.Microscopic oxygen inhomogenities may also appear at corner and edges of the grains.A monotonous"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Peaks marked by are (00l) reflections of the substrate. variation of the net oxygen concentration towards the film- substrate interface therefore monotonously increases the c-axis length. Thus, the coexistence of unequally reduced grains (diameter % 200-300 nm) is supported by a broader (109) diffraction spot in RSM [Fig. 3(b)] than that of Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 [].  For increasing magnetic field inductions, the superconducting transition is shifted to lower temperatures, due to the pair-breaking character of the magnetic field. At B \u00bc 6 T, zero resistivity is not observed at 1.8 K for both samples, albeit a drastic drop of the resistivity value appears. For B \u00bc 8 T, both samples do not show any signs of superconductivity.  Therefore, we conclude that the upper critical magnetic field is nearly identically about 0 H c2 % 6 T, even though both samples significantly deviate each other since one is a so-called 'optimally-doped' and the other is a dopant-free T 0 -cuprate superconductor. The upper critical magnetic field provides an estimation of the superconducting coherence length GL % 7 nm.For magnetic fields larger than 8 T, the resistivity behavior is found to be quite different between the samples.  While an upturn of the resistivity is found for Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 below 12 K, the dopant-free Nd 2 CuO 4 cuprate shows metallic behavior over the entire temperature range.  The resistivity upturn might be associated to a localization effect caused by apical oxygen ions although further investigations are necessary to clarify its origin. 32) Finally, we make a comment on the origin of electron carriers in Nd 2 CuO 4 .In both Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 and Nd 2 CuO 4 , the as-grown samples are insulating and super- conductivity appears after a reduction treatment.   In the case of Ce-substituted Pr 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 , Richard et al. demon- strated, that the reduction process does not alter the carrier concentration.  Such a scenario can be projected to the case of cerium free Nd 2 CuO 4 samples, thus, scenarios where oxygen vacancies provide electron carriers to the CuO 2 planes might be ruled out.  The difference between Nd 2 CuO 4 and Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 is simply a modified thermodynamic stability region of the annealing procedure.At present, site- resolved oxygen occupancy measurement data of super- conducting Nd 2 CuO 4 thin films do not exist.However, it is safe to exclude the possibility of an O1 deficiency in the CuO 2 plane, which results in non-superconducting or insulating samples.An O2 deficiency in the Nd 2 O 2 fluorite layer also appears unlikely since the Nd-O bond is significantly stronger compared to the Cu-O bond.Hence, there are no experimental data suggesting a modification of the O2 occupancy upon annealing.At the very moment, the sole mechanism rendering a non-superconducting Nd 2 CuO 4 into a superconducting Nd 2 CuO 4 sample upon annealing is the evacuation of apical sites although further investigation on site specific oxygen occupancies are vital for a sound comprehension of the superconductivity influencing factors in T 0 -cuprates."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Mercury with its exceptionally low melting and boiling temperatures offered the best perspectives with respect to very low impurity levels.  Heike Kamerlingh Onnes had built at the University of Leiden a unique cryogenic facility where he was able to achieve substantially lower temperature than any other laboratory. This led him in 1911 to his famous experiment to see how low one can go concerning electrical resistance. The observed sudden jump to apparently zero resistivity below 4 K came nevertheless as a big surprise. Kamerlingh Onnes immediately recognized it as indication of a new state of matter. In 1933, the discovery of Walter Mei\u00dfner and Robert Ochsenfeld that magnetic fields are expelled from a superconductor, demonstrated that superconductivity is actually a true thermodynamical state since in contrast to the situation for a merely perfect conductor this expulsion is independent of the experimental history ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Matthias and John K. Hulm started in the early 1950s a extensive systematic search that delivered a number of new compounds with high T c well above 10 K as well as technically attractive B c2 well above 10 T. The most prominent examples of this crop were NbTi (T c = 9.2 K) and the A15 materials, A 3 B type intermetallic compounds, the materials basis for todays SC wire industry.    Having generated some 3000 different alloys in the 1950s and 1960s Matthias became a recognized wizard of the SC materials science.He condensed his huge practical knowledge into \"rules\" of how to prepare \"good\" superconductors: High crystal symmetry, high density of electronic states at the Fermi level, no oxygen, no magnetism, no insulators! In spite of his inofficial sixth rule \"Stay away from theorists!\", in 1957 the BCS theory brought up a desperately awaited breakthrough of theoretical solid state physics, a microscopic explanation of superconductivity. Due to the atomic bomb development, single isotope SC samples, e.g., mercury, had become available where the dependence of T c on the isotope mass pointed to a phonon-driven mechanism. John Bardeen realized that phonons introduce an attractive interaction between electrons close to the Fermi surface (\"overscreening\").  The key idea of BCS theory is that even a tiny attractive interaction between these electrons leads to the formation of bound electron pair states (\"Cooper pairs\"). The electrons in these paired states are no longer obliged to obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, which enforces the electrons to occupy high kinetic energy single particle states due to the Pauli principle. The energy gain of the SC state with respect to the normal state does not result from the small binding energy of the pairs but it is the condensation energy of the pairs merging into a macroscopic quantum state.This results in an energy gap for electron excitations into single particle states. Although the BCS theory was derived from the physical idea of attractive electron-phonon coupling, the model-based weak pair coupling theory as its mathematical essence is well applicable to other pairing mechanisms.BCS theory had an impact not only on solid state physics but also on elementary particle physics where it was further developed to the idea of the Higgs mechanism of elementary particle mass generation (origins, impact and current state of the BCS theory are reviewed in )."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The rationale was the BCS T c -formula where a high characteristic phonon frequency, as provided by the light boron atoms, was predicted to be particularly helpful with respect to a high T c . In the 1990s, the borocarbide superconductors RE Ni 2 B 2 C (RE: Rare Earth element) with T c up to fulfilled this promise at least halfway. However, phonons are here only one of the candidates of contributing superconductivity mechanisms.   For Rare Earth borocarbides there is additional magnetism due to localized RE 3+ 4f-electrons which is weakly interacting with superconductivity associated with the 3d- electrons of the Ni 2 B 2 layers.A huge surprise came in 2001 with the discovery of superconductivity up to T c = 40 K in MgB 2 , a compound which had been well-known since the 1950s and which was in 2001 already commercially available in quantities up to metric tons . As for the fullerides, in spite of the high T c a phononic mechanism is here highly plausible: Coulomb correlation effects do not play a role since the conduction electron system involves neither inner atomic shells nor a reduction of the effective dimensionality. A new feature, multiband superconductivity, i.e., the coherent coupling of the Cooper-pair instabilities of several Fermi surfaces turned out to be essential for the theoretical description of the SC properties .    This multiband mechanism plays an even more dominant role in iron-based supercon- ductors where the scattering between the Fermi surfaces of up to five Fe-derived electronic bands is apparently the origin of a complicated magnetic superconductive coupling mechanism .In contrast to the cuprate HTS the parent compounds are here metals with a spin-density wave long-range magnetic order. LaFePO, the first representative of this SC materials family was discovered in 2006 but did not gain much attention due to its comparatively low T c = 5 K.T c = 26 K, however, observed two years later for the next iron pnictide compound LaFeAsO started a \"gold rush\" resembling the cuprate HTS situation twenty years before: T c was immediately pushed up to 55 K .The iron chalcogenide FeSe with a bulk-T c = 8 K attracted only little attention as a structural oddity representing the irreducible SC basis structure of a combined iron-based superconductor family until recently T c up to 109 K was achieved in a FeSe monolayer on a SrTiO 3 substrateIt is still under debate whether this high T c is an intrinsic FeSe bulk property or due to interface superconductivity of the quasi 2d electron gas at a polar interface as it was first observed for ultrathin LaAlO 3 films on SrTiO 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

As a success of conventional phonon-based first-principles theory this experimental result had even been predicted and a posteriori reproduced with amazing accuracy in more refined calculations .In these experiments with sulfur-hydride and recently also with phosphorous-hydride with T c up to ~100 K the high pressure is obviously required in order to destabilize the starting compound.  As a proof of principle these results revive hopes for high-temperature superconductivity mediated by high-energy hydrogen-based phonons .   Nevertheless, they can not be easily translated into a recipe for the preparation of technically useful materials where chemical pressure stabilizes superconductivity even under regular ambience conditions.This caveat holds true even more for the induction of transient superconductivity up to a temperature of 300 K under intense infrared or terahertz frequency pulse illumination as recently reported for the strongly underdoped cuprate HTS YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7-\u03b4 (\"YBCO\") and for similar experiments on the cuprate HTS La 1.675 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.125 CuO 4 and La 1.875 Ba 0.125 CuO 4 as well as on K 3 C 60 .Even accepting the spectroscopic evidence as experimental criterion for the presence of superconductivity as a thermodynamic bulk state, it is on the one hand clear that the involved dynamical process can not be directly mimicked by any materials design.On the other hand, the details of the concluded mechanism of an antagonistic interplay between superconductivity and charge (density wave) order are still under debate: Recent experiments on TiSe 2 as model substance for a study of this interplay under well-defined electric-field controlled doping conditions demonstrate a spatial texturing of superconductivity indicating a complicated local phase separation scenario ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

The following scenario applies to hole-as well as to electron-doping of all cuprate HTS (see ) : The undoped compounds are antiferromagnetic insulators up to a critical temperature T N well above 300 K, with alternating spin orientations of the hole states that are localized around the Cu atoms in the CuO 2 layers. Adding charge carriers by doping relaxes the restrictions of spin alignment due to the interaction of these additional spin-1/2-particles with the spin lattice.

The quasi- 2-dimensional nature of superconductivity in HTS leads to a pronounced anisotropy of the SC properties with much higher supercurrents along the CuO 2 planes than in the perpendicular direction and a corresponding anisotropy of \u03bb, e.g., \u03bb ab = 750 nm and \u03bb c = 150 nm in YBCO (the indices refer to the repective orientation of the magnetic field). Material imperfections of the dimension of the coherence length which are required as pinning centers preventing the flux flow of magnetic vortices are easily encountered in HTS due to their small coherence lengths, e. g., for optimally doped YBCO \u03be ab = 1.6 nm, \u03be c = 0.3 nm for T \u2192 0 K which are already comparable to the lattice parameters (YBCO: a = 0.382 nm, b = 0.389 nm, c = 1.167 nm ).

Nowadays, the effect is used to generate electrmagnetic radiation in the THz range . If the thickness of the charge reservoir blocks EO/(AO x ) m /EO in-between these stacks is larger than \u03be c vortices are here no longer well- defined due to the low Cooper pair density (see ). This leads to a quasi-disintegration of the vortices into stacks of \"pancake vortices\" which are much more flexible entities than the continuous quasi-rigid vortex lines in conventional superconductors and require therefore individual pinning centers. The extent of this quasi-disintegration is different for the various HTS compounds since \u03be c is on the order of the thickness of a single oxide layers, e.g., d TlOx = 0.2 nm for the Tl-HTS .

It is set aside from all other unconventional superconductors insofar as it exhibits two SC phase transitions. The exciting discovery of the split superconductive transitions in UPt 3 at T c1 = 530 mK and T c2 = 480 mK in specific heat measurements has led to an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work on UPt 3 .     The additional small moment antiferromagnetism observed in UPt 3 (T N = 5.8 K, \u00b5 = 0.035 \u00b5 B ) plays a key role in the identification of the SC order parameter since the in-plane staggered magnetization acts as a symmetry breaking field (SBF) to the SC multicomponent order parameter. The SBF is believed to be responsible for the appearance of two SC transitions which otherwise would merge into one.Therefore one can identify three distinct SC phases. Despite the wealth of experimental results on UPt 3 there is no unequivocal consensus on the symmetry and node structure of the SC gap.UPd 2 Al 3 (see ) is a rather special case among the U-based HF superconductors. There is also AF order below T N = 14.3 K with almost atomic size local moments (\u00b5 = 0.85 \u00b5 B ) in contrast to the small moments in other U-compounds.  The AF order coexists with superconductivity below T c = 1.8 K.  This suggests that in addition to the heavy itinerant quasiparticles nearly localized 5f-electrons should be present.  They result from the dominating 5f 2 configuration of the U 4+ ion .This dual nature of 5f-electrons is even more obvious than in UPt 3 as is seen in various experiments. A direct confirmation of this dual nature of 5f-electrons in UPd 2 Al 3 was obtained from inelastic neutron scattering (INS) which found excitations that originate from local CEF transitions and disperse into bands of \"magnetic excitons\" due to intersite exchange.Complementary tunneling experiments with epitaxial UPd 2 Al 3 -AlO x -Pb heterostructures probed the response of the itinerant quasiparticles and their SC gap.Strong coupling features in the tunneling density of states were reported suggesting that the magnetic excitons identified in INS are the bosonic \"glue\" which binds the electrons to Cooper pairs .This new mechanism for superconductivity is distinctly different from both the electron-phonon and spin fluctuation mechanism known so far.The pairing potential is mediated by a propagating boson (the magnetic exciton) as in the former case but depends on the spin state of conduction electrons as in the latter case."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.

Such a condition is hardly ever fulfilled except immediately below the Curie temperature T C where coexistence has been found in a few superconductors with local moment ferromagnetism and T C < T c such as ErRh 4 B 4 and HoMo 6 S 8 .  If the temperature drops further below T C the internal ferromagnetism molecular field rapidly becomes larger than H c2 and superconductivity is destroyed. The reentrance of the normal state below T C has indeed been observed in the above compounds.

The discovery of unconventional superconductivity under pressure in the itinerant ferromagnets UGe 2 and later for URhGe and the 3d ferromagnet ZrZn 2 (more recent investigations showed that here only a surface layer probably with higher Zr content becomes SC ) under ambient pressure has opened this theoretical scenario to experimental investigation.  URu 2 Si 2 (see , a \"moderately heavy\" fermion compound has mystified experiment- alists and theorists alike with the discovery of AF order and another still unidentified \"hidden order\" phase. In addition, the compound becomes a nodal superconductor below T c = 1.2 K .   The simple tetragonal AF order with wave vector in c-direction has tiny moments \u00b5 ~ 0.02 \u00b5 B along c-axis which are of the same order as in UPt 3 .However, unlike in UPt 3 , very large thermodynamic effects, e. g., in specific heat, thermal expansion etc., occur which are hard to reconcile with the small ordered moments. These pronounced anomalies were interpreted as evidence for the presence of a second \"hidden order\" parameter, which cannot be seen in neutron or x-ray diffraction. In the itinerant models the order parameter is due to an unconventional pairing in the particle-hole channel leading to an unconventional SDW which has vanishing moment in the clean limit and also does not break time reversal invariance.   The small staggered moments may then be induced in the condensate due to impurity scattering.Finally, in the dual models one assumes a localized singlet-singlet system in interaction with the itinerant electrons to cause induced moment magnetism with small moments but large anomalies.In all models it was previously taken for granted that both the primary \"hidden\" order parameter and AF order coexist homogeneously within the sample.However, hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure experiments have radically changed this view, showing that the order parameters exist in different parts of the"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the superconductors materials mentioned in the text? \nOnly provide the mention of the materials.
