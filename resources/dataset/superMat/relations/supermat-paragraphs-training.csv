While measured under ""zero field"", there still exists a remanent field of ∼ 1 Oe. The precisions of ac magnetic suscep- tibility (χ ac ) and dc susceptibility (χ dc ) are better than ∼ 10 −7 emu and ∼ 10 −5 emu, respectively.  The electri- cal resistivity (ρ) was measured in a standard four-probe configuration using a pressed sample bar. The heat ca- pacity was measured using an automated relaxation tech- nique with a square piece of ∼ 20 mg sample. The con- tribution from the addenda has been subtracted.  It is noted that the handling of the sample and the detailed measurement procedure sometimes affect the experimen- tal result very much.So, we kept the same experimental condition for the different measurements. (a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures for the Na 0.31 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O sample. The real part of ac suscep- tibility χ ′ shows the onset of diamagnetism at 4.3 K, followed by a broad superconducting transition, similar to the original report .  The diamagnetic screening sig- nal at 1.9 K is 9.2 % of the full shielding when the ac field amplitude (H ac ) is 2 Oe, suggesting relatively low superconducting fraction.   Considering that the χ ′ value is not flat down to 1.9 K, the superconducting volume fraction will be over 10 % under the remanent field of ∼ 1 Oe.The imaginary component of the ac susceptibil- ity shows an incomplete dissipation peak, also suggesting that the superconducting transition is not finished yet at 1.9 K.The dc susceptibility under 30 Oe shows even low magnetic exclusion, which is primarily due to the very low H c1 value as well as the magnetic penetration (see the result below).An irreversible temperature can be noticed, like that observed in the high T c cuprates."

Note that the upper-right axes are employed for the amplificatory plot in (a). The inset of (b) shows the temperature dependence of the upper critical field Hc2. Sommerfeld parameter. The phonon contribution can be separated by employing the T 2 vs C/T plot. It can be seen that good linearity is satisfied in the temperature range of 4.5 K< T <11 K. We thus obtained γ = 15.9 mJ/K 2 •mol-f.u. (f.u. denotes formula unit) and β = 0.235 mJ/K 4 • mol-f.u. Θ D is then calculated to be 391 K using the formula Θ D = (12/5)N π 4 R/β) 1/3 , where N =7.21 for Na 0.31 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O and R=8.314 J/mol•K. The γ value is significantly smaller than that of the par- ent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 (γ ∼ 40 mJ/K 2 •mol-Co ). Since the Sommerfeld parameter γ is related to the den- sity of state (DOS) at Fermi level, N (E F ), by the relation where N (0) is the bare, or band-structure electronic DOS at E F , λ ep an electron-phonon interaction parameter , one can ob- tain that N (E F )=6.7 states/eV•f.u.  On the other hand, λ ep can be calculated to be 0.57 using the formula where Coulomb repulsion parameter µ * is assumed to be 0.13 empirically .Therefore, N (0) is derived to be 4.3 states/eV•f.u. We note that this value is almost identical to the band calculation result (4.4 states/eV•Co) for the parent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 . It is noted that the sample's magnetic susceptibility (∼ 2.0×10 −3 emu/mol-f.u) is almost temperature indepen- dent from 30 K to 300 K (not shown here).  In order to obtain the Pauli susceptibility χ P auli , the χ(T ) data were fitted using the equation χ = χ 0 + AT 2 + C/(T − θ) . We obtained that χ 0 , A, C and θ are 0.0019 emu/mol, 2.6 ×10 −9 emu/mol•K 2 , 0.0024 emu•K/mol and 1.7 K, respectively. The parameter C gives the small effective magnetic moment of 0.14 µ B . The small positive θ value suggests the existence of weak ferromagnetic correlations. The unusually large χ 0 value should be dominantly con- tributed by χ P auli , which is probably enhanced by the Stoner-type ferromagnetic correlation. The Wilson ra- tio, R W = π 2 k 2 B χ P auli /3γµ 2 B , is calculated to be 11, in sharp contrast with the case of heavy fermion supercon- ductor . At 4.3 K, specific heat anomalies can be seen, which is ascribed to the superconducting transition. The spe- cific heat jump at the T c under zero field, ∆C obs , is 6.9 mJ/K•mol-f.u, further confirming the bulk superconduc- tivity. When applying magnetic field, both the ∆C obs and T c decrease as expected.It is noted that the T c (H) values are basically consistent with the H c2 (T ) result de- scribed above."

The anhydrous parent compound Na 0.61(1) CoO 2 has two partially occupied Na sites sandwiched, in the same plane, between CoO 2 layers. When Na is removed to make the superconducting composition, the Na site that experiences the strongest Na-Co repulsion is emptied while the occupancy of the other Na site is reduced to about one third.  The deuterate superconducting compound is formed by coordinating four D 2 O molecules (two above and two below) to each remaining Na ion in a way that gives Na-O distances nearly equal to those in the parent compound. One deuteron of the D 2 O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO 2 plane and the oxygen atom and the second deuteron of each D 2 O molecule lie approximately in a plane between the Na layer and the CoO 2 layers.This coordination of Na by four D 2 O molecules leads in a straightforward way to ordering of the Na ions and D 2 O molecules consistent with the observation of additional shorter-range scattering features in the diffraction data.  The sample studied here, which has T c =4.5 K, has a refined composition of Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 •1.25(2)D 2 O, in agreement with the expected 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O. These results show that the optimal superconducting composition should be viewed as a specific hydrated compound, not a solid solution of Na and D 2 O (H 2 O) in Na x CoO 2 •yD 2 O. The hydrated superconducting compound may be stable over a limited range of Na and D 2 O concentration, but studies of T c and other physical properties vs.Na or D 2 O composition should be viewed with caution until it is verified that the compound remains in the same phase over the composition range of the study."

The refined composition, Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 •1.25(2)D 2 O, suggests that the maximum T c is achieved at a composition slightly off the ideal composition, in agreement with other reports for the composition at maximum T c .   In the sample studied here, which was made in a way that places the composition at a plateau in partial pressure of D 2 O in equilibrium with the sample, the ideal 1:4 Na to D 2 O ratio is maintained, even though the sample is slightly deficient in both Na and D 2 O compared to the ideal model.

Thus, reports of water contents higher than 4/3 are not necessarily inconsistent with the model presented here, especially in the case where the Na content is below 1/3. However, the incorporation of two water molecules per formula unit, as reported by Jin et al. seems unlikely in light of the structure.Perhaps reports of water concentrations higher than 4/3 should be viewed with suspicion until it is shown that all of the water is actually in the lattice.  Surface adsorbed water could easily cause errors in bulk measurements of water content.The data presented here for the partial pressure of D 2 O in equilibrium with the hydrated material (Fig . ) argue that the water content does not depart far from the ideal 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O molecules.  Even if extra water can be accommodated in the space made available by Na vacancies, as the ideal Na content of 1/3 is approached the ability to accommodate extra water would be expected to decrease, Additionally, for Na contents greater than 1/3, the compound must either generate ""Na interstitial"" defects in the Na ordering, where the extra Na ions could not achieve the fourfold coordination to D 2 O molecules, or phase separate.The data of Schaak et al. for T c vs.Na concentration are consistent with phase separation for Na contents above x=1/3.T c remains constant at ~2 K, while the superconducting fraction decreases, for increasing Na contents above 1/3."

Baskaran has presented a theory based on the idea that the highest T c in this system occurs between the compositions Na 1/3 and Na 1/4 that would be expected to give ordered phases.   One hypothesis of his theory is that ordering of Na ions would promote charge ordering of the Co atoms, which, in turn, would suppress superconductivity.Thus, the ordered phases at the ideal compositions x=1/3 and 1/4 would be unfavorable for superconductivity.  In agreement with these ideas, the maximum T c is achieved at a Na concentration below x=1/3.  However, the present results show that the optimal superconducting composition displays ordering, over an in-plane coherence length of ~1000 Å, the same as for the ideal x=1/3 composition.  The increase of T c upon decreasing the Na content from x=1/3 could simply be a doping effect, as proposed by Schaak et al.To better understand this behavior, it is important to understand what happens when the Na concentration is further reduced toward the composition x=1/4, which corresponds to a different ordered structure in Baskaran's model.  Fig . shows a possible ordered structure with this Na concentration. At this Na concentration, each Na ion can achieve sixfold coordination to D 2 O molecules.  This is also the most common coordination for Na oxide and hydrate structures. The present data give no evidence for the occurrence of this ordered compound.However, if it does form at the Na composition x=1/4, the data of Schaak et al. for T c vs. composition may have a different interpretation.The drop in T c from 4.5 K to 2 K upon decreasing the Na concentration from 0.30 to 0.26 may result from a transition from the Na 1/3 to the Na 1/4 phase.If this is the case, the conclusion that the dome-like behavior of T c mimics the behavior seen in the layered cuprates [5] may be premature.Clearly, a careful structural study of a composition near x=1/4 must be pursued."
23,P068214517-CC,19,Na x CoO 2 •yD 2 O,4.5 K,,,"In conclusion, we have shown that the highest reported T c (=4.5 K) in the Na x CoO 2 •yD 2 O system is achieved in a hydrate phase with well-defined composition and ordering of both Na ions and D 2 O molecules.  The deuteration of Na leads to the formation of 2D 2 O-Na-2D 2 O ""pillars"" extending between the CoO 2 planes. This interesting ""pillar"" structure is further stabilized by hydrogen bonding within the planes of the D 2 O molecules to form zigzag D-O•D-O•D-O. chains. These structural results are in contrast to initial reports that implied that the material could be viewed a solid solution that could intercalate both Na and D 2 O in varying amounts. The ideal composition of the superconducting phase is Na x CoO 2 •4xD 2 O (x≈1/3).  The sample studied here has a refined Na composition of x=0.31(3) and a perfect 1:4 Na to D 2 O ratio (within one esd) consistent with the ideal structure, but with vacancy defects on both the Na and D 2 O sites; i.e., entire 2D 2 O-Na-2D 2 O ""pillar"" sites are vacant. . This hydrated phase would be expected to exist only within rather narrow composition limits.For x≥1/3, fourfold coordination of Na by D 2 O molecules cannot be achieved.  As x approaches 1/4, a different ordered phase, involving sixfold coordination of the Na, could be formed.Thus, measurements of physical properties, such as T c, vs. composition should be viewed with caution until it is confirmed that all samples in a particular study are in the same phase."

In the superconducting state, the specific heat follows conventional BCS-type behavior down to 1 K, i.e. over three orders of magnitude in specific heat data.

A power law fit H c2 (T ) = H c2 (0)(1 − (T /T c ) n ) (dashed line) gives an exponent of n = 1.0 ± 0.1 and a critical temperature T c = (6.37 ± 0.03) K.  Such a linear behavior of H c2 is also observed in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 .The initial slope of the critical boundary at T c is −d(µ 0 H c2 )/dT | T =Tc = 1.2 T/K.  The upper critical field of a superconductor is determined by the combined effect of an external magnetic field on the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the conduction electrons.  Werthamer et al. have worked out a theory for H c2 which includes both spin and orbital paramagnetic effects as well as nonmagnetic and spin-orbit scattering . In RbOs 2 O 6 , the upper critical field does not, however, behave as predicted by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula in the dirty limit, as can be seen in Fig .The initial slope of the critical boundary at T c results in a Maki-parameter α = −0.52758 K/T × d(µ 0 H c2 )/dT | T =Tc = 0.64 ± 0.1 . Spin contributions to the energy balance of a superconductor become important when α 1.  Applying the WHH model, we would therefore have to conclude that RbOs 2 O 6 is in the orbital limit away from the Pauli-limiting regime with an orbital critical field of H * c2 (T = 0) = αH p0 / √ 2 = 5.3 T.This field might be a good extrapolation of the critical field to 0 K judging from Fig . .However, calculations based on a realistic Fermi surface are needed to further clarify the detailed behavior of H c2 ."

The inherent geometrical frustration of the three dimensional tetrahedral Os sublattice attributes further importance to this new superconductor. We find that a careful analysis of the specific heat data, taking into account the normal-state volume fraction, implies conventional BCS-type behavior. Although the compound could be expected to be only marginally different from the related compound KOs 2 O 6, a significant difference in the magnitude of the upper criti- cal field H c2 is observed.Considering the potential for competing electronic groundstates in these compounds, the pyrochlore type superconductors may be of fundamental importance to address unsolved issues."

One may notice that the residual resistivity ρ 0 of these samples [7] becomes systematically larger with increasing La doping, although ρ 0 is very small (∼20 µΩcm) at op- timum doping; the z dependence of ρ 0 is plotted in Fig. . Figure shows the plot of T c /T max c vs S(290K) of our BSLCO crystals (T max c = 36 K), together with the ""universal"" relation reproduced as a dashed line. It is clear that the two curves do not agree at all.   This is either because the universal relation between p and S(290K) does not hold in the BSLCO system or because the T c values are somehow reduced from the ideal value (and thus does not correctly reflect the hole concentra- tions).To determine which is actually the case, we pay attention to the peaks in Fig. , which corresponds to the optimum doping; if we can find an evidence from another experiment that the optimum T c of BSLCO is in- deed realized at p ≃ 0.16, it is a clear indication that the universal relation of T c /T max c vs S(290K) is disobeyed in BSLCO.Note that the S(290K) value of the optimally- doped BSLCO sample (∼ −6 µV/K) corresponds to p ≃ 0.22 in the ""universal"" relation ."

Since ρ 0 of the z=0.39 sample is small [Fig. ], we assume that our optimum T c is not sig- nificantly affected by disorder and thus we take T max c = 36 K for the calculation of T 0 c .  Figure shows the plot of actual T c vs p of the BSLCO system, together with the fictitious T 0 c vs p.It is clear in Fig. that T c (p) of the BSLCO system shows a faster drop in both the underdoped and overdoped sides of the phase diagram, which is probably caused by disorder as inferred from the increase in ρ 0 when z moves away from the optimum doping [Fig. ]."

A nominal compressive stress is applied along the a axis, with corre- sponding strains (ε aa ≡ δL=L 0 ) estimated to be up to approximately 0.72% using a precalibrated capacitive dila- tometer; The accuracy is limited by the unknown deforma- tions of the epoxy clamp .

Gap values as small as ∆ = 10.5 meV have been observed leading to 2∆/kTc near the BCS limit for d x 2 −y 2 pairing.  Temperature dependence of the gap magnitude, ∆(T ), follows the BCS relation and both the quasiparticle gap and Josephson current vanish for T > Tc.Above Tc, the tunneling conductance shows a flat background without any indication of a pseudogap near the Fermi level."
39,EPL0580589,4,Bi-2212,56 K,,,"While it is generally accepted that the pseudogap is a property of the underdoped phase, it is still debatable whether it is also present in the overdoped region. Whereas T * can be determined in various experiments (e.g., a change in slope of in-plane resistivity vs. T ) a corresponding direct measurement of a pseudogap in the density of states is not always avail- able. For overdoped HTSs, none of the experimental techniques listed earlier have detected a clear pseudogap . Some results from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and planar tunnel junctions have suggested that the pseudogap exists at all hole doping concentrations in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ (Bi-2212).  In contrast, another STM study in the ab-plane of Bi-2212 does not show any gap-like feature in the overdoped phase . These conflicting observations hinder our understanding of the pseudogap and demand further tunneling investigations of the overdoped phase of Bi-2212. One reason for the conflict might be that the doping level of Bi-2212 in the region of the junction is not the same as in the bulk.  Miyakawa et al. have demonstrated a clear relationship between the energy gap (∆) and hole concentration and therefore the measured gap provides important information on the local doping level.Here we report measurements of heavily overdoped crystals (T c = 56 K) that exhibit a ∆ value as low as 10.5 meV, much smaller than the optimal doped value of 38 meV and clearly in the overdoped state."

Additionally, the magnitude of the Josephson current peak in (a) diminishes until it vanishes around T c . This is further evidence that the junction T c is the same as the bulk value. Both figures show no presence of any depression above T c such as is observed in underdoped Bi-2212 .   Note the increased sensitivity of the vertical scale in for the higher-temperature data.For comparison, we show some previously published data on underdoped Bi-2212 in . The superconducting gap is washed out around the bulk T c = 77 K of the crystal but a weak depression in the conductance remains which is consistent with a pseudogap. The absence of any pseudogap in our present measurements is consistent with recent ARPES studies on the same type of samples. In that study, the midpoint of the spectral weight peak shifted to the Fermi level at T c , showing no evidence of the pseudogap that is seen in optimally doped or underdoped Bi-2212 .Thus, there are now two measurements which show that the pseudogap disappears in heavily overdoped Bi-2212."

However, the tunneling subgap conductance shapes at low tempera- tures in figs. 1(a) and (b) are not consistent with the s-wave BCS theory prediction which is supposed to be flat near zero bias.

The SIS conductance is calculated by where c is a proportionality constant.F (E) is the Fermi function. The formula also includes a directionality function f (θ)=1+α cos(4θ) which corresponds to a preferred tunneling along the d-wave lobes. Here α is the directionality strength, which is assumed temperature independent (α = 0.4) . The fit (solid line in ) shows good agreement in the subgap region with the experimental data. Thus there appears to be no change of symmetry away from d-wave. However for |eV | > 2∆ the data deviate from the BCS d-wave fit, exhibiting broader peak widths and the dip feature. In general, these features are compensating which allows conservation of states; however, the data in lead to an integrated area out to 150 meV which is about 6% above the BCS d-wave fit. We attribute the discrepancy to the inability to accurately know the background conductance at 4.2 K. The broad peaks and dip feature are observed throughout the doping range and have been attributed to strong-coupling effects ."

De Jongh described in Ref. that 'the concentration of bipolaron is nearly always too high, a metal-insulator transition occurs at low temperatures (as in Ti4O7) accompanied by a CDW and a structural change, instead of the much-sought-for transition to superconductivity'. Our growth of Ti4O7 films under Ar gas atmosphere aims at inducing extra Ti 3d electrons by oxygen vacancies which dilute the bipolaron density.  In fact, the inverse RH of the superconducting film suggests the suppression of the bipolaron formation (Fig. ). In the bipolaronic phase diagram shown in Fig. of Ref. , the bipolaronic insulator and superconductivity co-exist at a specific bipolaron density. Our Ti4O7 film grown under a moderate growth atmosphere (PAr = 1 × 10 -6 Torr) exhibited hysteresis at ~150 K and superconductivity at 2.9 K (see Fig. and Fig. ).

However, the anomaly was also observed in SbS2-based compound, Ce(O,F)SbS2, which does not show superconductivity . These facts imply that the magnetic anomaly is independent of the superconductivity, and it is caused by the common structure of Ce(O,F) layers, different from the superconducting BiS2 layers.The appearance of anomaly in Ce(O,F)BiS2 is attributed to originate from the valence modification in Ce atoms to Ce 3+ -rich state by the F substitution."

At low temperatures, its temperature dependence is directly re- lated to the density of low energy quasiparticles, which in turn can be related to the anisotropy of the supercon- ducting energy gap on the Fermi surface. For investiga- tion of the low lying excitations and thus the anisotropy of the energy gap, the analysis is considerably less am- biguous if measurements are performed on high quality single crystal and temperatures well below T c /3. In this paper we report magnetic penetration depth measure- ments on single crystals B 0.63 K 0.37 BiO 3 (T c ≈ 31 K) down to 0.4 K.  The investigation of mechanisms of super- conductivity in B 1−x K x BiO 3 (BKBO) system has been one of the important subjects in studies of high T c su- perconductivity in oxide materials. The significance of BKBO lies in observations that some of its supercon- ducting properties are consistent with the conventional s-wave isotropic superconductivity, but others are resem- bling high-T c cuprates.   In particular, substantial iso- tope effect , strong phonon contribution from the neutron scattering measurements , and a supercon- ducting gap with 2∆ 0 /T c =3.5±0.3 from the tunnelling and optical experiments indicate significant role of electron-phonon interactions in mechanism of su- perconductivity of BKBO.However the low density of states at the Fermi level with T c as high as 30K and insulator-superconductor transition by doping are similar to high-T c cuprates.However, in contrast to high T c cuprates which have two dimensional CuO 2 planes, BKBO has simple three dimensional cubic perovskite structure."

The Curie temperature T C ∼ 130 K observed from magnetization measurement in the prototype compound RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 is probably a canted G-type antiferromagnetic order with Ru 5+ moment µ canted along the tetragonal basal plane resulting a small net spontaneous magnetic moment µ s ≪ µ(Ru 5+ ) too small to be detected in neutron diffraction.The occurrence of high-T c superconductivity with maximum resistivity onset T c (onset) ∼ 60 K in RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 is related with the quasi-two-dimensional CuO 2 bi- layers separated by a rare earth layer in the Ru-1212 structure.  Broad resistivity transition width ∆T c = T c (onset) -T c (zero) ∼ 15-20 K observed is most likely originated from the coexistence and the inter- play between superconductivity and weak-ferromagnetic order.   The diamagnetic T c is observed anomalously at lower temperature near T c (zero) instead of at T c (onset), and a reasonable large Meissner signal was reported using stationary sample magnetometer with diamagnetic T c ∼ 30 K in ≤ 1 G applied field at zero-field-cooled (ZFC) mode.Lower T c (onset) ∼ 40 K and 12 K were observed for RuSr 2 EuCu 2 O 8 and RuSr 2 SmCu 2 O 8 , respectively.No superconductivity can be detected in RuSr 2 RCu 2 O 8 (R = Pr, Nd). 3,16 Superconducting RuSr 2 YCu 2 O 8 phase is stable only under the high pressure.The physics is still unclear in this system, and it will be interesting to investigate the effect of the weak- ferromagnetic order on superconducting critical fields B c2 and B c1 , as well as on the possible existence of a spon- taneous vortex state (SVS) at higher temperature above the Meissner state."

The broad transi- tion width ∆T c = 17 K observed is the common feature for all reported Ru-1212 resistivity data, which indicates that the superconducting Josephson coupling along the tetragonal c-axis between Cu-O bi-layers may be par- tially blocked by the dipole field B dipole of ordered Ru moments in the Ru-O layer.The diamagnetic T c at 39 K was observed in the 1-G ZFC susceptibility measurement.  The full Meissner shielding signal 4πχ V = 4πM/B a ∼ -1.5 (Gaussian units) was recorded at 5 K.  This value is identical to the Meissner shielding sig- nal expected for a superconducting sphere with a demag- netization factor N of -4π/3 and in an applied field B a well below lower critical field B c1 . The large diamag- netic signal in 1-G ZFC mode is the best data observed so far from various reported susceptibility measurement techniques. Since our measurements were per- formed with the standard moving-sample SQUID mag- netometer, it is clear that sample quality is more crucial than measuring techniques.Both ZFC and FC data re- veal a Curie temperature T C of 131 K.However, in 1-G FC mode, no diamagnetic field-expulsion signal can be detected below 39 K due to strong flux pinning where superconductivity coexists with weak-ferromagnetic or- der."

148,L088227002-CC,2,Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2,43 K,,,"The predominantly d x 2 2y 2 pairing symmetry , the existence of spin fluctuations in the CuO 2 planes , and the pseudogap phenomena in the underdoped and optimally p-type cuprates have been widely con- ceived as essential to high-temperature superconductivity. However, recent scanning tunneling spectroscopic studies have shown that the pairing symmetry may be dependent on the hole-doping concentration, with ͑d x 2 2y 2 1 s͒ mixed symmetries in certain overdoped cuprates such as ͑Y 12x Ca x ͒Ba 2 Cu 3 O 72d .  Furthermore, whether the pairing symmetry is d x 2 2y 2 or s wave in the one- layer n-type cuprates such as Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d and Pr 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d remains controversial , and it has been suggested that the pairing symmetry in the one-layer n-type cuprates may change from d x 2 2y 2 to s, depending on the electron doping level . The nonuniversal pairing symmetries in cuprate superconductors imply that the sym- metry is likely the result of competing orders rather than a sufficient condition for pairing.    Nonetheless, an important consequence of either d x 2 2y 2 or ͑d x 2 2y 2 1 s͒-wave pairing is that the resulting nodal quasiparticles can interact strongly with the quantum impurities in the CuO 2 planes , such that a small concentration of impurities can give rise to strong suppression of superconductivity and modification of the collective Cu 21 spin excitations .In addition, Kondo effects could be induced by nonmagnetic impurities through breaking the nearest- neighbor antiferromagnetic Cu 21 -Cu 21 interaction . Such strong response to nonmagnetic impurities is in sharp contrast to conventional s-wave superconductivity .Despite significant progress in the studies of cuprate superconductivity, the research on the simplest form of cuprates, the infinite-layer system Sr 12x L x CuO 2 (L La, Gd, Sm), has been limited due to the difficulties in making single-phase samples with complete superconduct- ing volume.  Recently, Jung et al. have demonstrated single-phase samples of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 with nearly 100% superconducting volume and a sharp superconducting tran- sition temperature at T c 43 K, thus enabling reliable spectroscopic studies of the pairing symmetry and the ef- fects of quantum impurities. These single-phased infinite- layer cuprates are n-type with P4͞mmm symmetry, which differ significantly from other cuprates in that no excess charge reservoir block exists between consecutive CuO 2 planes except a single layer of Sr(La), as illustrated in , suggesting stronger CuO 2 interplanar coupling.  Furthermore, the c-axis superconducting coherence length ͑j c 0.53 nm͒ is found to be longer than the c-axis lattice constant ͑c 0 0.347 nm͒ , in stark contrast to other cuprate superconductors with j c ø c 0 .Hence, the super- conducting properties of the infinite-layer system are ex- pected to be more three-dimensional, as opposed to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of all other cuprates.In this Letter, we report experimental findings based on the scan- ning tunneling spectroscopy studies of pure infinite-layer samples and those with a small concentration (1%) of ei- ther magnetic or nonmagnetic quantum impurities.A num- ber of surprising results are found and compared with the established phenomena in other cuprates."

The superconductivity transition at 1.1 K is not due to filamentary superconductivity of Re, since the observed critical field is much larger than the critical field of Re (0.02 T), as will be described below.  The large residual resistivity of 4 × 10 −3 Ω•cm may suggest a low carrier density of this system.From band calculations, it is pointed out that the system has a very small density of states at the Fermi level, which is located within the 5d-band and in the valley between the very flat bands of the rhenium 5d electrons.However, the electronic specific heat coefficient has been found to be large, i. e., γ=13.3 mJ/Re mol• K 2 , indicating that heavy quasiparticles are formed due to the spin-frustration in this compound."

164,Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC,1,Ni/Bi bilayers,near 4 K,,,"Superconductivity (SC) is one of the most intriguing physical phenomena in nature. Nucleation of SC has long been considered highly unfavorable if not impossible near ferromagnetism (FM) 1-5 , in low dimensionality 6,7 and, above all, out of non-superconductor. Here we report observation of SC with TC near 4 K in Ni/Bi bilayers that defies all known paradigms of superconductivity, where neither ferromagnetic Ni film nor rhombohedra Bi film is superconducting in isolation 8 .   This highly unusual SC is independent of the growth order (Ni/Bi or Bi/Ni), but highly sensitive to the constituent layer thicknesses.Most importantly, the SC, distinctively non-s pairing, is triggered from, but does not occur at, the Bi/Ni interface. Using point contact Andreev reflection (AR) 9 , we show evidences that the unique SC, naturally compatible with magnetism, is triplet p-wave pairing. This work might open a new door to explore novel SC which could lead to potential applications in superconducting spintronics 10,11."

However, after a 3 nm Ni is deposited on Bi, the Ni(3 nm)/Bi(20 nm) becomes superconducting with TC about 4 K, as shown by the blue curve together with the inset in Fig. .   It should be noted that with the appearance of superconductor in Ni(3 nm)/Bi(20 nm), the Ni layer still remains ferromagnetic even above 300 K as shown by the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) result in Fig. .The incompatibility of FM and SC notwithstanding, this is the most dramatic nucleation of SC, in which a non-superconducting material becomes superconductor when it is covered by a strong ferromagnet."

In Fig. , we measured a series of Bi/Ni(4 nm) samples with a fixed Ni(4 nm) layer for which the SC has already been completely suppressed as shown in Fig. . As we increase the Bi layer from 15 nm, remarkably the SC reappears again with the same TC of 4 K.   Since the SC in the Bi(15 nm)/Ni(4 nm) is completely suppressed by the exchange field from the Ni layer, further increasing the Bi layer thickness cannot modify the interface or affect the Ni layer, the recurrence of the SC implies that the SC does not occur at the interface even though it may be triggered by the interface, which is again diametrically different from the S/F proximity effects. In fact the reappearance of the SC is a salient feature for the Ni/Bi superconducting systems.As seen in Fig. , when TC is plotted as a function of the Bi film thickness for several Ni film thicknesses, in each case there is always a similar sharp increase (within 5 nm) to saturation. For example, the SC for Ni(6 nm) reappears at about 30 nm of Bi, very far from the interface, and its TC reaches about 4 K at 35 nm of Bi.This result also excludes unambiguously the possibility that the SC in Bi/Ni comes from Bi-Ni alloy if any at the interface."

However, the contact resistance between two superconductors does not depend strongly on the contact size and this can be used to verify the SC at the surface of the Bi/Ni bilayers. We choose Indium, which is a conventional superconductor with TC = 3.41 K, as a soft tip to contact on the bare sample Bi (20 nm)/Ni (2 nm). A schematic setup of the point contact is illustrated in the inset of Fig. .   We have made over 10 contacts, all the contacts shows a similar resistance very close to zero, showing that the surface of Bi/Ni bilayer is indeed superconducting. The temperature dependence of a representative contact resistance is shown in Fig. .The TC of both superconductors are obvious and consistent with Fig. .This result shows that the Bi surface is indeed superconducting."

The Ca-intercalated graphite, CaC 6 , with its ""record"" T c of about 11.5 K, in particular, has been the subject of various theoretical and experimental in- vestigations in the past two years (for a short review of the initial results see ).One of the most important questions, however, is still not clear: what is the mag- nitude and anisotropy of its superconducting gap? The first experiments (STM, penetration depth, specific heat) on CaC 6 have evidenced a single, apparently isotropic, s- wave gap with a ratio 2∆/k B T c of the order of the BCS value .   Recent tunnel spectroscopy results, on the other hand, claimed the presence of an isotropic gap with a magnitude more than 40% higher than that reported earlier .  The spread of gap values measured up to now range between 1.6 meV and 2.3 meV . The im- portant point is that all these experiments have either probed a bulk property or a directional one along the c-axis direction .As pointed out in Ref., the presence of anisotropic or two-gap superconductivity in CaC 6 cannot be ruled out until tunneling or point- contact measurements are performed also along the ab direction.On the other hand, recent first-principles den- sity functional calculations of the superconducting prop- erties of CaC 6 have supported the presence of a moder- ately anisotropic gap which varies between 1.1 and 2.3 meV, depending on the k-point and the π or interlayer (IL) sheet of the Fermi surface (FS) involved .Such an anisotropy can be revealed by directional spectroscopy measurements performed along both c and ab direction."

The resulting CaC 6 samples have a shiny golden surface. They are very sensitive to air and moisture which rapidly damage the sample surfaces. X- ray analysis has shown mainly the CaC 6 reflections with a small (< 5%) contribution from impurity phases.  Fur- ther details on the characterization of the samples may be found in Ref. .All samples used for PCAR spectroscopy (size ≈ 1×1×0.2 mm 3 ) were selected to have a very sharp superconducting transition (∆T c (10% − 90%) = 0.1 K) with the onset at T c = 11.4 K.

It is widely accepted that the in-plane response of the cuprates is in the clean-limit and the strong mid-infrared response is due to strong correlation effects in the cuprates. In particular the marginal Fermi-liquid (MFL) , and Lut- tinger liquid approaches along with the conventional strong electron-phonon interaction have been put forward to account for these unusual properties.  In these models the strong mid-infrared conductivity is related to the linear frequency dependence of the scattering rate of the quasi-particles in a single band picture.Therefore, the normal state properties of the in-plane conductivity of Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6 down to approximately 10 K should play a pivotal role in a clear separation of the different excitations."

Indeed, supporting evidence for a FL ground state has only sur- faced very recently with the experimental verification of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in OD Tl 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ (Tl2201) (T c ∼ 15K) .   By suppressing superconduc- tivity in a large magnetic field, Proust et al. observed the precise WF ratio κ ab /σ ab T = L 0 , where κ ab and σ ab are the in-plane thermal and electrical conductivities and the Lorenz number L 0 = 2.44 × 10 −8 WΩ/K −2 .Sur- prisingly however, and at odds with a conventional FL picture, the WF relation was found to co-exist with a large linear resistivity term extending down to 0K.  This dichotomy raises the question whether the field-induced 'normal state' in OD HTC, i.e. beyond H c2 , is the same as the ground state that would exist in the absence of a magnetic field, as it does in more conventional super- conductors.Moreover, a clear understanding of the ex- perimental situation in OD cuprates has often been com-pounded by their tendency to undergo phase separation."

This material is of particular interest with regard to the issues mentioned above because of its structural similarity to Y-123, ab- sence of oxygen vacancies on the CuO chains, and the naturally underdoped state of the CuO 2 planes.  We find that the magnitude of κ a (transverse to the chains) at T =300K is comparable to that of Y-123, but κ b is 3- 4 times larger. A very large in-plane anisotropy in the lattice conduction is implied. Both κ a (T ) and κ b (T ) be- have as in conventional crystalline insulators (like Nd- 214); their maximum values (at T ≃ 20K) are the highest reported for any cuprate and exceed those of Y-123 by an order of magnitude.  These results imply a strong damp- ing of phonons by static or dynamic structural distortions as the source for the much weaker T dependence of κ ab in Y-123. The superconducting-state enhancement for Y-124 is comparable in magnitude to that of T c =60K Y- 123, consistent with the underdoped state of the planes in the double-chain compound.We discuss the anisotropy of the enhancement and its implications for the Lorenz number."

201,L095167004-CC,5,Cd 2 Re 2 O 7,1 K,,,"Polycrystalline samples of AOs 2 O 6 were prepared as reported previously [1-3]. For CsOs 2 O 6 and RbOs 2 O 6 , they were nearly single-phase including a small amount of Os metal.  For KOs 2 O 6 , 10 mol% of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 was contained as another phase, which was necessary to obtain a sufficiently hard pellet for resistivity measurements. The coexistence of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 may not affect the determination of T c , because it becomes insulating below 230 K .    Electrical resistivity measurements were performed by the four-probe method in a cubic-anvil press apparatus [14] at high pressures from 2 GPa to 10 GPa and temperatures from 3 K to 300 K.A fluorinert liquid, which is a one-to-one mixture of FC-70 and FC-77 (3M TM ), was used as a pressure transmitting medium. A polycrystalline pellet of a typical size of 0.8 × 0.3 × 0.4 mm 3 was immersed into the fluorinert liquid in a cylindrical teflon capsule of 1.5 φ × 1.8 mm 3 size.Then, the capsule was put into a cubic pyrophillite block of 6.0 mm edge and compressed almost isostatically by using six anvils made of tungsten carbide.  The whole of the sample cell and the press was placed in a liquid-helium dewar to cool down to 3 K.  Each run of resistivity T 2 , as shown in the inset to Fig.3(a) for RbOs 2 O 6 , to determine A and ρ 0 . The slope of the T 2 term in RbOs 2 O 6 is large at 2 GPa and does not change much up to 3 GPa near the T c maximum.Then it decreases very much from 4 GPa to 7 GPa, where T c decreases and finally disappears, and then increases again at 8 GPa and 10 GPa. The origin of an upturn observed at low temperatures above 7 GPa is not known and it is ignored in evaluating A and ρ 0 .  Such an upturn was not detected in our recent experiment using a better quality of sample.   The same analysis has been carried out for CsOs 2 O 6 .   The resulting pressure dependences of A and ρ 0 are summarized in Fig. 4.  In order to deduce a general trend, each quantity has been normalized by the value at the maximum of the T c dome. Pressure is also normalized as P n = ( P -P* ) / ( P c -P* ), where P* is a pressure at the T c maximum and P c is a critical pressure where superconductivity disappears; that is, P n = 0 for P = P* and P n = 1 for P = P c .For KOs 2 O 6 , only T c is plotted, because we could not obtain reliable data due to the presence of impurities. It becomes apparent now that normalized T c falls on a universal curve. Either normalized A and ρ 0 is connected smoothly between RbOs 2 O 6 and CsOs 2 O 6 to show a general curve: Normalized A exhibits a broad maximum near the T c maximum and a minimum near P c , while normalized ρ 0 shows a minimum near P* and a maximum near P c . In the framework of Fermi liquid theory, A is proportional to square of effective mass of carriers or density of states at the Fermi level.Thus, the above results on A imply that the carrier mass is enhanced significantly at the T c maximum owing to correlation effects. This strongly suggests that the mechanism of superconductivity in the β-pyrochlore 4 oxides is relevant to electron correlations. On the other hand, residual resistivity is generally expressed by the equation ρ 0 = ( ħ / e 2 l ) ( 3 π 2 ) 1/3 n -2/3 , where l is the mean free path of carriers and n is carrier density. The mean free path at low temperature may be determined by the concentration of impurities or defects and thus should not be affected by pressure.  It is expected, however, that the mean free path would be reduced largely by quantum fluctuations developing toward absolute zero, which often exist near a quantum critical point associated with a certain long-range order such as a magnetic transition or valence transition [16,17].   The observed enhancement in ρ 0 near P c may indicate that there is an unknown long-range order at higher pressure. Possibly, the sudden recovery of metallic behavior observed below 100 K at 10 GPa in RbOs 2 O 6 (Fig.3(b) is related to this long range order.   It is plausible that the associated quantum fluctuations would suppress the superconductivity, giving rise to a dome-shaped T c variation.  The observed dome-shaped change in T c and the corresponding unusual variations in A and ρ 0 must reflect unconventional features of superconductivity in the β-pyrochlore oxides. However, it seems that they are quite different from those observed in well-known unconventional superconductors, such as f-electron intermetallic compounds or low-dimensional organic conductors [12,18]. A typical f-electron compound CeCu 2 Ge 2 exhibits a large reduction in A and a sharp peak in ρ 0 at the T c maximum, which is believed to be induced by valence fluctuations [12,16,17]. In the present β-pyrochlores osmium ions are formally in a 5.5 valent state with two and a half 5d electrons.It is interesting to note that this number of 5d electrons is just between two integer values for Re 5+ ions (5d 2 ) in 1 K superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 and Os 5+ ions (5d 3 ) in Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 exhibiting a metal-to-insulator transition [13, 19].However, we think that valence fluctuations may not play a primary role in the β-pyrochlores, because the band width of Os 5d -O 2p hybridized bands is large, ~3 eV, from the band structure calculations [20-22].The most plausible scenario for quantum fluctuations is to assume electronic instability associated with Fermi surface nesting.Harima has pointed out that an important general feature on the band structure of the β-pyrochlores is the existence of a pair of Fermi surfaces of nearly octahedral shape which forms a thin shell centered at the Γ point.Thus, strong Fermi surface nesting and resulting spin-density-wave instability are expected.Moreover, a 'dimple' grows on the octahedral Fermi surface from K to Cs, suggesting that the nesting becomes weaker along this line.It would be interesting to test how this feature changes under high pressure.In order to clarify the existence of possible quantum fluctuations in the β-pyrochlore oxides and their relevance to the superconductivity, further experiments are required under high pressures.In summary, we have obtained interesting and characteristic behavior in the pressure dependence of T c and other parameters in the β-pyrochlore oxides AOs 2 O 6 by measuring resistivity under high pressure up to 10 GPa.Generally, the T c shows a dome-like shape as a function of pressure.The variations of the coefficient A of the T 2 term and the residual resistivity ρ 0 are also anomalous and synchronized with the change in T c .These results suggest that electron correlations enhance the superconductivity, while certain quantum fluctuations give rise to the degradation of T c at higher pressure."

This phase diagram provides an evidence that there is no coexisting AFM phase of the Fe sublattice with SC, although a higher maximum of T c appears near a boundary between the AFM and Ferri. phases of V. Magnetic and valence states of the V dominate T c of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3−δ indirectly.   This phase diagram extends our knowledge to understand optimum chemical compositions for the superconductivity of iron-based MALC and should help understand the mechanism of enhancing T c in multinary transition metals-based MALC; promising materials for superconducting applications under high magnetic fields.

Superconductivity in this ma- terial observed at T c = 2.3 K is unconventional, as evidenced by the power-law behaviors of its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and spin-lattice relaxation .   Furthermore, magnetic-field dependent thermal conductivity experiments are consistent with d-wave superconductivity.The first-order nature of the superconducting transition in magnetic fields and a second anomaly observed close to H c2 below 1 K make CeCoIn 5 an excellent candidate for a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state . The normal state of CeCoIn 5 is equally unusual, characterized by a NFL C/T ∼ −lnT and a T −linear electrical resistivity , consistent with proximity to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) QCP .  Further, measurements  in magnetic fields above H c2 = 4.95 T (H||c) reveal an evolution from NFL to FL behavior and a universal scaling of the Sommerfeld coefficient, leading to the conclusion that long-range AFM order was narrowly avoided at a quantum critical point H QCP = 5 T.A similar evolution exists in CeCoIn 5 when the magnetic field is applied in the ab-plane where H c2 = 12 T ."

Measurements were performed down to 1.2K for LSCO and 4.2K for Hg-1201 using the low-field ac-susceptibility technique with an ac-field of 1G RM S at 333Hz parallel to the CuO 2 planes.For LSCO the value of p is taken to be equal to the Sr content x, whereas for Hg-1201 it was determined by estimating the oxygen content and verified by thermopower measurements as in ref. .   Transport, magnetic and spectroscopic measurements confirmed the high quality of our samples.  The data were analysed using London's model for small aligned crystallites of anisotropic HTS.Details of the technique and data analysis can be found elsewhere . The low-field ac-susceptibility technique gives the fractional diamagnetism of a superconductor and thus is a direct probe of the magnetic penetration depth . For each doping concentration of LSCO, the result presented here is typical of those obtained for four samples prepared in- dependently from the same polycrystalline pellet. Each of these samples was aligned at different times and from each sample 4 pieces were cut and measured. Therefore a total of 16 samples were investigated for each doping content.In the case of Hg-1201, two samples were pre- pared from the same polycrystalline pellet and again 4 pieces of each aligned sample were cut and measured for each doping level.The error of λ c (0) is estimated to be < 8% for LSCO and < 10% for Hg-1201, while the error in the relative temperature dependence λ c (T )/λ c (0) is < 1% and is therefore negligible."

Namely, the value of 1.5µm that we obtained for a slightly overdoped sample by the ac-susceptibility technique corresponds to the simple situation where there is no normal state gap.  Although the values of Kirtley et al. and Basov et al. correspond to samples with high values of T c (96K) the results shown here strongly suggest that their values of λ c (0) correspond to significantly lower doping levels where the normal state gap comes into play.  In this sense our results support the ILT model-since the only clear exception to this model is now the Tl-2201 compound .However, we should note that for any pairing mechanism (not just ILT) the presence of the normal state gap also leads to a similar correlation be- tween the condensation energy, and the superfluid den- sity, i.e., λ c (0) and λ ab (0) .  There are also dis- tinct differences between λ c and λ ab . The anisotropy γ increases on the underdoped side and the T -dependences at low temperatures (at T < 0.3T c ) are very different. Namely, the in-plane component varies always linearly with T whereas the c-axis counterpart varies as T n with n ≃ 3 for LSCO [this work] and n ≃ 5 for Hg-1201 . Details on possible mechanisms leading to these power laws can be found in ref. .Therefore, it is not imme- diately obvious that the qualitative similarities between λ c (T ) and λ ab (T ) shown in Fig. can be understood within the ILT theory where interplane Josephson effects dominate the c-axis electrodynamics."

T c vanishes again upon overdoping for p's larger than a critical value, p c ≈ 0.27 hole/Cu, where the strength of the antiferromagnetic corre- lations also vanishes .  A further notion, which is gener- ally assumed to be valid is that the overdoped materials with p > p c behave more or less as conventional metals described by Fermi liquid theory.In fact, this second assumption is not supported by much empirical data and it may not be correct for the first (s = 1) member of the homologous seeries of cuprates Cu 1−x Mo x Sr 2 (Y,Ce) s Cu 2 O 5+2s+δ , originally syn- thesized by Ono and then synthesized and characterized to- gether with the higher members of the series up to s = 6 by other groups , .

The CoO 2 layer is formed by the hexagonal arrangement of the Co ions, which is in contrast to the tetragonal arrangement of the Cu ions in the copper oxides.A deficiency of the sodium atom leads to dope 0.65 holes into the layer of the insu- lating low-spin (S = 0) state of Co +3 .  This hole doping results in 0.35 electrons doped in the triangular lattice consisting of S = 1/2 of Co +4 . Such triangular magnetic lattice is regarded as having magnetic frustration and one may expect that unconventional superconductivity is realized on the basis of such frustration. Then just af- ter finding the superconductivity in the present material, many theoretical proposals of possible unconventional superconductivity have been presented. The exper- imental investigation on the superconductivity, however, has not progressed so much because of difficulty of get- ting the single crystal. It is highly desirable to obtain the basic superconducting parameters in magnetic field, for example, the upper critical field H c2 , the coherence length ξ, and those anisotropy.These basic material pa- rameters must be important to understand NMR and NQR results reported so far, which should give cru- cial information about the pairing symmetry and the gap anisotropy."

254,P069014507-CC,24,F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ,60K,,,"A well-known fact in R-123 phase superconductors is that the superconductors with higher oxygen content have smaller lattice parameters a and c. This phenomenon was also observed in the Y Sr 2 Cu 2.7 F e 0.3 O 7+δ superconductor and in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ superconductor ob- tained by high oxygen pressure synthesis.  In these superconductors, the diffraction peaks of (006) and (200) shift systematically to higher angle degree with the increase of oxygen content, which is similar to our results. All our HP-samples have smaller lattice parameters a and c than the corresponding AM-samples, and the lattice unit cell of HP-samples displays an obvious shrinkage.   Since the relative shrinkage is not more bigger than other samples an- nealed under high oxygen pressure, and also for that F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ sample can be made superconducting without high pressure synthesis, thereby this shrinkage can be attributed to the increase of oxygen content, but not the pressure effect caused by the high pressure synthesis procedure.Then it can be deduced that in all F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 (Ba 1−x Sr x ) 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ samples the oxygen content increased after high pressure synthesis, which is validated by the oxygen content measurement in F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+δ system where 7+δ increased from 7.20(2) in AM-sample to 7.35(2) in HP-sample. The increased oxygen content provided the required charge which made the semiconducting-like AM-samples changed to supercon- ducting HP-samples. The diffusion of F e atom into CuO 2 planes in R-123 systems is believed to be very unfavorable for superconductivity because of its magnetic moment, and with the increase of F e concentration, this diffusion is inevitable in samples synthesized by common solid-state reaction .     J.Shimoyama et al. used a complex annealing procedure which is believed to suppress the incorporation of F e to the CuO 2 planes in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ system, and finally made it superconducting with T c ∼ 60K.Using neutron powder diffraction studies, T.Mochiku et al. investigated the site-mixing between F e and Cu atoms in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+δ samples synthesized through different procedures, and proved that simply increasing the oxygen content could not produce superconductivity and the ordered distribution of F e and Cu atoms between Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites is also one of the key points to the origin of superconductivity.In our heavily F e-doped R-1212 systems, high pressure synthesis procedure is believed to promote the transfer of F e atoms from Cu(2) site to Cu(1) site, and to make almost all the F e atoms to occupy the Cu(1) chain site.This redistribution of F e atoms is a needed requirement to ensure the occurrence of superconductivity, while the increase of oxygen content provides the needed amount of charge."

The estimated upper critical field at zero temperature exceeds the Pauli limit by a factor of two.

The calculated 'bare' density of state (DOS) at E F is less than 1/3 of the experimental value from the specific-heat measurement, confirming the electron correlation effect.

Notice that all the previous observations of disorder induced PG were for samples that are slightly OD and optimally doped respectively . Here we have reported this effect over a fairly wide doping range from p = 0.205 to 0.11.It is fair to say that there are two main effects of Zn substitution for Cu(2) in cuprates : (i) Zn tends to localize carriers in the CuO 2 plane (depending on temperature and Zn content) and (ii) it gives rise to ""Curie- like magnetic moments"" possibly on the four neighboring Cu sites (in the presence of short-range antiferromagnetically correlated background).  Recent 63 Cu NMR and inelastic neutron scattering studies suggest that Zn enhances the AF correlation in Y123. There is growing evidence that an AF background with short-range order does not exist in overdoped cuprates with p > 0.19 . The situation in highly disordered samples could be different, especially if there is phase segregation, and only a very weak form of superconductivity is present.  Under these circumstances Zn induced enhancement of short-range AF correlation might be a possibility for highly disordered Y 1-x Ca 1-x Ba 2 (Cu 1- y Zn y ) 3 O 7-δ irrespective of the hole content.It is very interesting to note that both the effects of Zn substitution (enhancement of short-range AF correlation or/and carrier localization in the CuO 2 plane) can be directly linked to the existence of the pseudogap.   AF fluctuation has been held widely responsible for (or at least partly contributing to) the formation of the PG by various theoretical and experimental studies .In another scenario, using the t-J model, strong Coulomb repulsion has been taken as responsible for both pseudogap and superconducting pairing . In the VHS scenario leads to localization of carriers and thus weakens the electrostatic screening, which, in turn effectively increases the Coulomb interaction.  As Zn plays a similar role on carrier transport in the CuO 2 planes, it can give rise to a pseudogap in the VHS scenario. It is hard to reconcile any precursor-pairing picture with this anomalous T * (p).On the other hand, scenarios in which the PG originates from correlations that are not related and compete with superconductivity, can possibly offer an explanation. In the competing correlations scenario T * (p) and T c (p) are detrimental to each other and the growth of one is accompanied by the decrease of the other (at least in the pure compounds). Kohno et al. 45 have in fact shown in their theoretical analysis that disorder can indeed strengthen one competing phase (AF) significantly over the other (e.g., superconductivity). The abrupt appearance of this anomalous PG-like feature in resistivity as a function of disorder content is indicative of some sort of threshold mechanism in action, consistent with some recent theoretical studies 5,46 . For example, in the study by Monthoux 5 it was shown that as quasiparticle life-time becomes shorter (with increasing scattering by spin fluctuations), it starts to ""feel"" long-range magnetic order even when only short-range correlations are present. The quasiparticle mean-free path relative to the correlation length of the short-range AF order determines the size of the pseudogap. As the quasiparticle life-time decreases with Zn, it is possible that at a certain level of Zn in the CuO 2 plane the scattering rate becomes high enough to dominate over the more gradual p-dependent scattering.  Using the Hubbard model, it was shown that a high scattering rate leads to the removal of low-energy spectral weight .In this scenario the local Coulomb repulsion, U, is the important parameter.Heavy Zn substitution increases the scattering rate, localizes quasiparticles and effectively enhances U/t (where t is the nearest-neighbor hopping energy) globally.Once U > 8t, the pseudogap becomes insensitive to U and therefore, should not show significant p- dependence .Roughly speaking, the mean distance between Zn impurities, l i , in the CuO 2 plane is given by ~ r/√z pl , where z pl = 3y/2 and r ~ 3.9Å is the distance between Cu atoms in the plane.For y = 0.06, l i ~ 13Å, close to the value of the in-plane superconducting coherence length, This should imply that once the distance between Zn atoms becomes comparable with the superconducting coherence length, abrupt changes in the various normal and superconducting state properties take place."

In the competing correlations scenario T * (p) and T c (p) are detrimental to each other and the growth of one is accompanied by the decrease of the other (at least in the pure compounds). Kohno et al. 45 have in fact shown in their theoretical analysis that disorder can indeed strengthen one competing phase (AF) significantly over the other (e.g., superconductivity). The abrupt appearance of this anomalous PG-like feature in resistivity as a function of disorder content is indicative of some sort of threshold mechanism in action, consistent with some recent theoretical studies 5,46 . For example, in the study by Monthoux 5 it was shown that as quasiparticle life-time becomes shorter (with increasing scattering by spin fluctuations), it starts to ""feel"" long-range magnetic order even when only short-range correlations are present. The quasiparticle mean-free path relative to the correlation length of the short-range AF order determines the size of the pseudogap. As the quasiparticle life-time decreases with Zn, it is possible that at a certain level of Zn in the CuO 2 plane the scattering rate becomes high enough to dominate over the more gradual p-dependent scattering.  Using the Hubbard model, it was shown that a high scattering rate leads to the removal of low-energy spectral weight .In this scenario the local Coulomb repulsion, U, is the important parameter.Heavy Zn substitution increases the scattering rate, localizes quasiparticles and effectively enhances U/t (where t is the nearest-neighbor hopping energy) globally.Once U > 8t, the pseudogap becomes insensitive to U and therefore, should not show significant p- dependence .Roughly speaking, the mean distance between Zn impurities, l i , in the CuO 2 plane is given by ~ r/√z pl , where z pl = 3y/2 and r ~ 3.9Å is the distance between Cu atoms in the plane.For y = 0.06, l i ~ 13Å, close to the value of the in-plane superconducting coherence length, This should imply that once the distance between Zn atoms becomes comparable with the superconducting coherence length, abrupt changes in the various normal and superconducting state properties take place."

The essential feature of this structure is the presence of infi- nite Zr 6/2 X 3 chains of confacial antiprisms of metal Zr on which the shared edges are bridged by isolated p-element atoms (anions) X, as shown in figure 1. The octahedral interstitial sites at the center of these confacial chains have been the subject of many studies, especially on the stabili- zation of pseudo-binary and ternary compounds with the Mn 5 Si 3 structure. Superconductivity has been reported firstly in Zr 5 Sb 3 with T c ∼2.3 K, and later in the Ru-doped Zr 5 Sb 3 and Hf 5 Sb 3 (with structure changing from Mn 5 Si 3 type to W 5 Si 3 type upon doping).   Recently, we have successfully induced superconductivity in the Ru-doped Zr 5 Ge 3 system, which remains the Mn 5 Si 3 type structure upon chemical doping, with a possible unconventional superconductivity signature. Surprisingly, the superconductivity induction is doping-site-selective.With the same Ru doping, super- conductivity only occurs with doping at the Ge site and remains absent with doping at the Zr site or an interstitial site above 1.8 K.  This indicates some other competing factors, other than charge carrier changes caused by doping, may also play an important role. In this paper, we have taken an alternative approach to examining this issue, and carried out systematic doping studies at different sites for the Zr 5 Ge 3 system. Chemical doping effects and structural instabilities caused by doping have been considered and tested for our doping studies in the Zr 5 Ge 3 system. Surprisingly, super- conductivity is only observed in the Pt doped Zr 5 Ge 3−x Pt x system besides our previous report on Zr 5 Ge 3−x Ru x samples.  We do not find superconductivity present in the same struc- ture for Pd, or Ir doping studies in a similar manner above 1.8 K.Furthermore, no superconductivity is observed for chemical doping (both hole and electron) at the Zr site, nor at the structural instability boundaries upon chemical doping in Zr 5 Ge 3 above 1.8 K.Our results suggest that Ge-Ru, and Ge-Pt are likely the critical charge-transfer pairs for the induced superconductivity, similar to the Sb-Ru pair reported in Zr 5 Sb 3−x Ru x and Hf 5 Sb 3−x Ru x compounds."

One can clearly see that superconductivity is only observed in the Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5 sample, and the other samples with the same doping level remain as poor metals in the measured temperature range above 1.9 K.The decreased residual-resistance ratio (RRR) in all the doped samples is expected from the enhanced scattering at low temperature caused by chemical doping.  It is worthwhile to note that sometimes a small drop of resistivity is observed in the Ir- containing samples, which is attributed to small impurities of the superconducting Zr-Ir alloy that is not detectable from XRD, but is evidenced from later SEM analysis. Apparently, the Pt element, similar to Ru, is critical for the induced superconductivity in the Zr 5 Ge 3 system.  Similarly, the induced superconductivity through Pt doping is also found to be site-selective.As shown in (b), with the same amount of Pt doping, only the Ge site doped sample Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5 is superconducting at 2.8 K, and the samples doped at the Zr site Zr 4.5 Pt 0.5 Ge 3 and at the octahedral interstitial site Zr 5 Ge 3 Pt 0.5 are found to be non-super- conducting at our lowest measured temperature.These results further support our hypothesis that critical pairing of Ge-Ru and Ge-Pt is essential for the superconductivity in the Zr 5 Ge 3 compound, similar to the observation found in the Zr 5 Sb 3−x Ru x and Hf 5 Sb 3−x Ru x compounds."

The formation of Zr 5 Pt 3 phase occurs when x > 1.The Zr 5 Pt 3 is known as a superconductor with T c at 7.2 K, which essentially affects our analysis.Therefore, we only focus on the doped samples up to x 1 for our following characterizations."

By measuring the point at which magnetic hysteresis curve M (H) deviates from linearity, we could identify the lower critical field H c1 , and our value was above 10 2 Oe, as are the values for other high-T c cuprates. Previously, it was claimed that H c1 was significantly less than 100 Oe. While the low-field magnetization demonstrated a highly enhanced superconducting volume fraction, the irreversible field H irr (T ) from the high-field magnetization up to 5 Tesla showed that pinning was very strong in this compound.  In , the magnetization curves for fields higher than 1 Tesla and the resulting H irr (T ) are presented. The criterion for the reversible point was set as |M zfc − M fc | = 0.1 emu/cm 3 .  The irreversible field was fitted with H irr (T)= H 0 (1-T/T c ) n .The best parameters were H 0 = 55.7 Tesla, T c = 42.6 K, and n = 1.99. The quite interesting point is that the H irr (T /T c ) of Sr(La)-112 is about 2 times higher than that of (La,Sr) 2 CuO 4 even though the superconducting transition temperature of both compounds are similar. If the criterion is chosen more strictly as |M zfc − M fc | = 0.01 emu/cm 3 , the irreversible field is increased by a factor of two."

The hydrostatic pressure was gen- erated in a copper-beryllium piston cylinder clamp that was especially designed for magnetization measurements under pressure.  The sample was thoroughly mixed with Fluorient FC77 (pressure transmitting medium) with a sample to liquid volume ratio of approximately 1/6. The pressure was measured in situ by monitoring the T c shift of the small piece of In [T c (p = 0) ≃ 3.4K] included in the pressure cell.   The field-cooled magnetization measure- ments were performed with a Quantum Design SQUID magnetometer at temperatures ranging from 2 to 100K.In Fig. we displayed the field-cooled (0.5 mT) mag- netization M of a YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 powder sample vs. T near T c for various applied hydrostatic pressures (0.0 kbar, 2.67 kbar, 4.29 kbar, 7.52 kbar, and 10.2 kbar). To iden- tify the temperature regime where critical fluctuations play an essential role it is instructive to consider the be- havior of dM/dT vs. T displayed in Fig. . With decreasing temperature dM/dT is seen to raise below the transition temperature and after passing a maximum value it decreases.  This behavior contradicts the mean- field behavior where dM/dT below T c adopts a constant value.It implies that the fluctuation dominated regime is accessible and attained.This calls for an analysis be- yond the mean-field approximation as outlined below."
350,P072094504-CC,2,MgB 2,39 K,,,"Shortly after the discovery of the superconductivity in MgB 2 at 39 K, several investigations of the pressure de- pendence of the superconducting critical temperature T c were carried out.   Indeed, the magnitude and sign of dT c /dp may indicate a way to rise T c at ambient pressure, and moreover, help to understand the superconducting pairing mechanism.So far, all these studies show that T c decreases with increasing pressure, with a rate depend- ing on the method and the pressure medium used.  The first hydrostatic measurement of T c (p) up to 0.7 GPa, re- veals that T c decreases reversibly under hydrostatic pres- sure at the rate dT c /dp = − 1.11(2) K/GPa. The be- havior of T c (p) with pressure in MgB 2 was attributed to the pressure induced lattice stiffening (increase of the phonon frequency), 5,6 rather than to the decrease in the electronic density of states N(E F ), that is only moder- ately affected by pressure.  Comparison with theoreti- cal calculations supported the view that MgB 2 is a BCS superconductor with moderately strong electron-phonon coupling. Apart from T c , an other relevant superconducting pa- rameter is the magnetic field penetration depth λ.  In fact the so-called superfluid density λ −2 is related to the Fermi velocity and to the density of charge carri- ers, and its temperature dependence gives information on the symmetry and on the magnitude of the supercon- ducting gap.A study of pressure effects on λ −2 (0) can give important informations on how the electronic de- grees of freedom are affected by lattice modifications and on the nature of the electron-phonon coupling.   Indeed, in cuprates high temperature superconductors (HTS), a huge pressure effect on λ −2 (0) was found, in particu- lar in YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 (Y124). Part of this effect was at- tributed to the strong renormalization of the Fermi ve- locity, and therefore to the effective mass, due to the non- adiabatic coupling of the electrons to the lattice. This result is in agreement with the substantial oxygen iso- tope effect found in cuprates and can be in- terpreted in the framework of non-adiabatic theory of superconductivity. 14 In this paper we report measurements of the mag- netic penetration depth under pressure in polycrystalline MgB 2 .The temperature dependence of λ −2 (T ) was ex- tracted from the Meissner fraction f measured in a low magnetic field.A small pressure (p) effect on λ −2 (0) was found [ ∆λ −2 λ −2 = 1.5(9)%], for pressure ranging from 0.15 to 1.13 GPa.Theoretical calculations of the pressure ef- fect on λ(0) confirm the smallness of this effect [ ∆λ −2 λ −2 ≃ 1.4%].These results contrast with the huge effect (∼ 40 %) on λ −2 (0) found in the non-adiabatic cuprate super- conductor Y124 in the same range of pressure 8 ."

The hydrostatic pressure was produced in a copper-beryllium piston cylinder clamp, especially de- signed for magnetization measurements under pressure (see Ref ). The sample was put in a teflon cylin- der and the pressure cell was then filled with Fluorinert FC77 as pressure transmitting medium. The Meissner fraction was calculated from low field magnetization mea- surements (field cooling) performed with a commercial Superconducting Quantum Interference Device.  In the approximation of spherical grains with average radius R, the Meissner fraction can be related to the magnetic pen- etration depth via the Shoenberg formula: 16 (1) Any change in χ/χ 0 due to pressure can be attributed mainly to a change of λ(T ), rather than to a change of R, which is practically pressure independent. The sam- ple was measured at low pressure p L = 0.15 GPa and at the highest pressure available p H = 1.13 GPa. The pres- sure values were determined from a preliminary calibra- tion measurement, where the same sample was measured in the pressure cell together with a small piece of lead. The pressure was detected by measuring the T c shift of lead (T c (0kbar)=7.2K).   We found dT c /dp = − 1.24(5) K/GPa, in good agreement with previous results.The real zero-pressure measurement could not be performed in the pressure cell, since, in order to seal the cell, at least a small pressure had to be applied. In the temperature dependence of the normal- ized magnetization of MgB 2 at p L and p H is shown in the vicinity of T c , together with the zero pressure p Z measurement performed on the same sample in a quartz tube. The T c's were obtained from the intercept of the linear extrapolations (see The magne- tization curves shift systematically with increasing pres- sure towards lower temperature. In the inset of we show the normalized magnetization as a function of the reduced temperature t = T /T c for p L and p H .The identical temperature dependences for both pressure val- ues indicate the absence of stresses in the sample due to pressure."

The results indicate that there exists a critical doping concentration p cr at which the pseudogap terminates and beyond which the ground state when the superconductivity is suppressed is a Fermi liquid. The critical point is around x=0.05 which corresponds to p cr ∼ 0.21, according to Ando's characterization (see the upper scale of the trans- verse axis of ).We mention a caveat that T * at zero magnetic field for the overdoped regime could be slightly higher than that we found here at high magnetic field , therefore p cr could be slightly higher. However, the limit for largest possible p cr is set by the x=0 sample (p ∼0.22) which shows no pseudogap."

The low-T normal state of the samples with x ≤0.40 (T c = 8 ∼32 K) has been accessed by suppressing superconductivity completely with the strong magnetic fields. It has been found that there exists a critical doping concentration at which the pseudogap state terminates.   The critical concentration is p cr ∼0.21 (x ∼0.05), which is deep in- side the overdoped region.Beyond p cr , the normal state down to T =2 K when the superconductivity is removed is a Fermi liquid state as evidenced by the T 1 T =const re- lation. Comparison of the low-T normal state where su- perconductivity is suppressed with the superconducting state suggests that superconductivity and the pseudogap coexist. This is also supported by the lack of correla- tion between T * and T c.These results that characterize microscopically, for the first time, the zero-T -limit nor- mal state of the copper-oxide superconductors, should pose a constraint on theories for the high-T c supercon- ductivity and may also provide clues for understanding other strongly correlated electron systems such as heavy fermion materials."

In addition, there is no Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction in the HTT phase, and the interlayer magnetic exchange is fully frustrated.Thus the HTT structure should provide the most homogeneous and magnetically isotropic environment of the four tilt structures listed in Table I.Very recent experimental work using scanning tunneling microscopy has highlighted the presence of charge ordering with (4a x 4a) or (4.5a x 4.5a) periodicities in the underdoped cuprates Na x Ca 2-x CuO 2 Cl 2 [6] and Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ, respectively."

FeSe (""11"" system) was also found to show a close relationship between T c and crystal structure, especially h P n .     The T c of FeSe, which is 8 K at ambient pressure, increases markedly under pressure, accompanied by a decrease in h P n .The pressure dependence of T c ex- hibits a plateau at approximately 1 GPa. 7) h P n shows a similar pressure dependence to T c , and reproduces the plateau, while the bond angle of Se-Fe-Se is almost un- changed under pressure. 4) NMR studies of FeSe have re- vealed that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations develop under pressure associated with the increase in T c .Results of these studies support that h P n is a key fac- tor for adjusting the nesting properties and T c .Between LaFePO (h P n = 1.12Å) and NdFeAsO 1−y (h P n = 1.38 A), T c increases with increasing h P n , while the T c of FeSe increases with decreasing h P n (h P n = 1.45 → 1.42 A).This suggests that an optimum h P n exists at ap- proximately h P n of NdFeAsO 1−y."

405,P068132504-CC,2,two-dimensional CoO 2 layers in the com- pound Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O,5 K,,Magnetic susceptibility mea- surements,"The recent discovery of superconductivity in two-dimensional CoO 2 layers in the com- pound Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O has attracted attention because of its possible similarity to the high-T c superconductivity in CuO 2 -planes of the cuprate systems but with a different spin state associated with Co.  The compound appears to be the first superconducting layered metal oxide involving 3d-transition metals other than copper. The de-intercalation of Na + ions accompanied by an intercalation of water molecules results in a combined doping and c-axis expansion effect effectively reducing the interlayer coupling between the CoO 2 planes and enhancing the two-dimensional character of the structure.  Magnetic susceptibility mea- surements have shown a diamagnetic drop below 5 K ascribed to the onset of superconduc- tivity although the estimated volume fraction is only of the order of 10% of the value for perfect diamagnetism.The high-field dependence of the susceptibility resembles that of the high-T c copper oxides, with little change of the onset but an appreciable broadening of the superconducting transition under increasing magnetic field.  Because of these similarities and the fact that the removal of water suppresses the superconductivity it was suggested that the large separation of the CoO 2 layers and the reduced interaction between them is essential for stabilizing the superconducting state.  The major difference to the square CuO 2 planes of the cuprates is the triangular symmetry of the Co-lattice that may lead to possible frustration effects in the magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetically interacting cobalt spins.Theoretical treatments therefore employ the t-J model on a planar triangular lattice. Different magnetic and superconducting orders, e.g. d-wave superconductivity, 2 a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking d x 2 −y 2 + id xy ground state, and spin triplet superconductivity 4 have been proposed.  To distinguish between different theoretical proposals and to facilitate our basic understanding of superconductivity in Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O far more experimental work needs to be conducted. In particular, the dependence of the superconducting state on the interlayer coupling is of interest. The CoO 2 interlayer coupling should be tuned reversibly by changing the distance between the planes (c-axis lattice parameter) without affecting the chemical composition, i.e. the content of sodium and water.This can be achieved by applying hydrostatic pressure.Because of the strong lattice anisotropy and the weak bonding between the layers (the water molecules are electrically neutral although polarized) it is expected that the compression of the c-axis increases the interlayer coupling and has a major effect on the superconductivity."
406,P068132504-CC,4,Na x CoO 2 •yH 2 O powder,4.7 K,,Magnetic susceptibility,"The Na x CoO 2 •yH 2 O powder was synthesized as described in Refs. 1 and 5. The x-ray spectrum shows the reflections of the hexagonal space group P6 3 /mmc with lattice parameters a=2.820Å and c=19.593Å. The structural parameters are in good agreement with the recently reported data. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate the onset of superconductivity at 4.7 K, the magnitude of the diamagnetic signal at 2 K in field and zero field cooling runs are comparable with data of Ref. 1.  Before starting the high pressure experiment the sample was carefully checked with respect to chemical compatibility with the liquid pressure transmitting medium (a 1:1 mixture of 3M Fluorinert FC70/FC77)."
407,P068132504-CC,6,Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O powder,4.2 K,1.53 GPa,,"The inductance, I(T), measured at different pressures is shown in Fig. (for clarity not all sets of acquired data are shown). The superconducting transition is well resolved and the onset of diamagnetism causes the decrease of the inductance signal below T c . The vertical drop of I(T) close to 7 K in Fig. indicates the diamagnetic signal from the superconducting transition of the lead manometer and it was used for pressure determination.  With increasing pressure the superconducting transition of the Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O powder shifts to lower temperature and the transition becomes slightly sharper. It is remarkable that the shape and the overall drop of the susceptibility curves do not change appreciably with pressure which indicates that the sample is stable at the applied hydrostatic pressure.  There is no sign of a possible chemical decomposition or loss of water during the experiments. After acquiring the highest pressure data the pressure was almost completely released (a residual pressure of 0.04 GPa was measured) and the susceptibility curve was found in good agreement with the ambient pressure data taken at the start of the experiments.These data are marked by filled squares in Fig. .  This again shows that the sample is stable and the superconducting properties are reversible under hydrostatic pressure. The T c (p) as estimated from the onset of the diamagnetic signal (see inset of Fig. ) is displayed in Fig. . For low pressure the change of T c is relatively small. With increasing pressure the T c decreases faster resulting in a non linear dependence T c (p) as shown in Fig. The solid line is a fit of the data to a parabolic pressure dependence, T c (p) = 4.68 − 0.0047 p − 0.183 p 2 (T c in K and p in GPa).  At the highest pressure of this experiment (1.53 GPa) the superconducting transition dropped to 4.2 K.Extrapolating the parabolic dependence to T c =0 yields a critical pressure of p c ≃ 5 GPa.  The recovery of the T c after pressure release is indicated by the filled square in Fig. 2 (in contrast to the open circles denoting data estimated within the increasing pressure cycle).  It should be noted that in the present experiments the pressure medium was frozen at the superconducting transition temperature.  This may result in deviations from pure hydrostatic conditions and small pressure gradients throughout the sample space could be expected.  Any pressure medium, even He gas at elevated pressure, will solidify at these low temperatures.In order to check on possible pressure gradients we have evaluated the width of the diamagnetic drop of the ac susceptibility in passing the superconducting transition of the lead manometer.The cooling speed was electronically controlled as low as 0.01 K/min.The width of the lead transition (as measured between the 90% and 10% drop of the susceptibility) was even at the highest pressure still below 0.01 K and only slightly larger than the zero pressure value of 0.008 K.If the small difference is attributed to a pressure gradient across the volume of the lead sample the inhomogeneity is less than 0.005 GPa at the maximum pressure of 1.6 GPa.With the Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O samples linear dimension being about 10 times the size of the lead the possible pressure gradients are still small and should not affect the results significantly."
408,P068132504-CC,7,Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O,4.7 K,,,"A negative pressure coefficient of T c is frequently observed in low-as well as high-T c compounds.  In low-T c (i.e. BCS-like, phonon-mediated) superconductivity the negative pressure shift of T c can be explained by a decrease of the electron-phonon coupling constant, λ. λ is proportional to the electronic density of states (DOS) and to the inverse of the average square of the phonon frequency. The application of pressure usually results in an increase of the phonon frequency (phonon ""hardening"" effect) and, in many instances, in a decrease of the DOS. Both effects lead to a decrease of T c , as was recently discussed, for example, in MgB 2 .  The high-T c cuprate superconductors exhibit both positive as well as negative pressure coefficients, depending on the compound and the doping state. For some hole-doped copper oxides a negative dT c /dp was reported in the overdoped regime and partially attributed to a pressure-induced charge transfer but it was also shown that this charge transfer is not the only factor affecting the pressure shift of T c (for an extensive discussion see Ref. ).Na 0.35 CoO 2 •yH 2 O is, however, an electron-doped system.   This has to be taken into account if the present data are compared with the high-T c cuprates.  For electron-doped cuprates, e.g Sm 1.88 Ce 0.12 CuO 4−y , the pressure coefficient of T c was found to be negative for a large number of systems with different chemical composition and (electron) doping.Thereby, a universal relation between the relative pressure coefficient, dlnT c /dp, and T c was proposed. According to this relation the pressure coefficient for a sample with T c =4.7 K should be of the order of -0.1 to -0.15 GPa −1 .The T c -p relation shown in Fig. is nonlinear, however, estimating the average pressure change of T c yields a value of dlnT c /dp=-0.07 GPa −1 and calculating the slope of T c (p) at the high pressure end of the graph we get dlnT c /dp=-0.1 GPa −1 .These values are in fair agreement with the typical pressure coefficient of an electron- doped high-T c superconductor with a similar ambient pressure T c."

These methods differ significantly by the choice of the initial reagents and the conditions of synthesis. Because the superconducting transition has now been reached only for materials based on iron-containing oxyarsenides LnOFeAs, we here mention the methods by which these systems can be obtained and which can be conditionally divided into several main groups (see ).  All polycrystalline (PC) oxyarsenides are obtained using solid-phase synthesis (SPS).Either simple substances are used as reagents or precursors (binary or, more seldom, ternary phases) are first synthesized.  Such precursors are most often binary arsenides or (and) metal oxides. The methods proposed differ in the number of stages, the temperature T and time t of annealing, and the composition of the atmosphere in which the experiment is carried out. The intermediate and final products are sometimes treated under pressure.As an illustration, we briefly present possible ways of obtaining neodymium-containing oxyarsenide NdO 1Àx F x FeAs; whose samples exhibit the critical temperature T c $ 50À51 K close to the highest record for this class of materials."

The analysis has shown that sufficiently high- quality NdO 0:85 FeAs samples can be obtained without additional thermal and pressure treatment. As a preliminary stage, the methods in included obtaining binary (ternary) phase-reagents NdAs, NdFe 3 As 3 , Nd 2 O 3 , NdF 3 , etc. The authors of developed the so-called single-stage method, which was applied successfully to obtain super- conducting 54.6-K SmO 0:7 F 0:3 FeAs samples.  The method allowed avoiding some intermediate procedures such as grinding, repeated pelleting, and annealing, which is very important in handling toxic substances such as arsenic. The Sm As SmF 3 Fe Fe 2 O 3 mixture was immersed in a tantalum tube sealed on one end. When filled, the Ta tube was closed on the other end by squeezing and was placed in an iron tube. The procedures were performed in an inert atmosphere and then annealing was applied in a furnace at T 1160 C (in an Ar flow to minimize possible product oxidation) for 40 hours. The samples (which were a conglomerate of nearly 10 mm plates) () were taken off after breaking the tantalum tube."

The remarkable thing is that T c is strongly reflected in interlayer distance rather than in-plane one.  Indeed, the enhancement of T c in LSCO, which reaches 51.6 K at 8 GPa, is mainly inter- preted in terms of interlayer expansion, which enhances two dimensionality. Therefore, we expect that measure- ment under anisotropy controlled pressures causes much higher T c than previously reported values for many high- T c materials."

The structural and magnetic properties of the sample were reported in the previous paper . The NMR experiments were carried out using a standard phase coherent type pulse spectrometer. 59 Co NMR spectra were obtained by recording the spin-echo intensity with the applied magnetic field changed step by step in a magnetic field range of 1-2 T. Measurements were carried out on two kinds of samples of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O, randomly oriented and aligned samples. The latter sample was prepared by mixing the Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O powder with epoxy adhesive (Stycast 1266) and keeping the mixture in a magnetic field of 11T at room temperature for ~12 h. Its X ray diffraction pattern indicates that the ab plane of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O crystallites align along the direction of the magnetic field with the spreading of about (±6°).  ( The lattice parameter c was found not to exhibit significant change after the alignment processes, which indicates no drastic change of the structure.)

The directions of the principal axes of Knight shift are assumed to be same as those of the electric quadrupole interaction. In the present case, the z-axis was defined along the direction, for which the component of the electric quadrupole tensor, ν zz is larger than the other components. This z direction was found to be along the c-axis by fitting the positions of calculated spectra to those of aligned sample. The fitted result for the data taken at 5 K in the magnetic field H within the ab plane of Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O is shown in (b) and the parameters determined by the fitting are, K x = ~3.5±0.1 %, K y = ~3.1±0.05 %, the electric quadrupole resonance frequency ν Q =3.6±0.05 MHz and the asymmetric parameter of the electric field gradient at nuclei η=0.28±0.02. For the spectra of the randomly oriented sample, K x = ~3.8±0.1 %, K y = ~3.14±0.05 %, .05 MHz and η=0.24±0.01 were found to reproduce them well. The comparison of the values of ν Q and η of the aligned sample with those of the randomly oriented one justifies the present assignment of the z direction along the c axis. shows the T dependence of the 59 Co-NMR spectra around the peak of central line for the randomly oriented powder sample. The H value of the peak position is nearly T-independent above T c (~4.5 K) and then increases with decreasing T below T c .  This change of the peak position is due to the T dependence of the Knight shift K y and not due to the second order effect of the electrical quadrupole interaction, because ν Q and η are T-independent, as was confirmed by analyzing the spectra in the H region between 0.8-2.4 T at 2.9 K, 4.7 K and 6.2 K."

The arrow in indicates the structural phase transition tem- perature T LT of La 1.84 Y 0.04 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . As decreasing temperature in 4T, R H of LYSCO shows the drastic decrease below the vicinity of T LT and the sign reversal occurs in the low temperature region from 25 K to 15 K.In the orthorhombic LSCO, only the gradual decrease in R H is observed below 50 K which is far above T c =27 K, but no sign reversal is detected. These experimental results seem to be commonplace, since the anomalous change of R H is observed in the TLT phase but not in the OMT phase and R H in the TLT phase goes to zero in low temperatures as expected in the simplified stripe model .  In 9 T, however, the sign reversal of R H in low temperatures is enhanced.In LYSCO, the temperature range where the sign is negative spreads and the absolute value at minimum point becomes larger, though the temperature where R H begins to fall is not changed in 9 T.Surprisingly in the orthorhombic LSCO, the sign reversal does appear below 20 K though no change of the sign is observed in 4 T."

The lattice parameters a and c are 2.8245 and 19.7101 Å, respectively. The uniform magnetic susceptibility χ was measured using a SQUID magnetometer with magnetic fields H= 5 Oe and 1 T.  The data for H= 5 Oe are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of T, where the onset of the superconductivity is found at T ~4.5 K.  The magnitudes of diamagnetic signals taken at T =2.0 K under the conditions of zero-field cooling and field cooling correspond to the volume fractions of ~24% and ~6%, respectively.These values are rather large for the powder sample with two-dimensional nature and therefore exclude the possibility that the superconductivity is filamentary. The T 1 of Co nuclei was measured by detecting nuclear magnetization after applying an inversion pulse in the frequency region around 3ν Q (the 5/2→7/2 transition), ν Q being the electrical quadrupolar frequency (~4.2 MHz at 4.23 K). This value of ν Q is consistent with the one estimated from the 59 Co NMR spectra of this sample. The nuclear magnetization m measured as a function of time t elapsed after the inversion pulse, was analyzed under the assumption that there exist two components with shorter and longer relaxation times, T 1short and T 1long , respectively. The following theoretical equation with the number fraction c of nuclear spins which have a shorter relaxation time T 1short , was used. A typical example of the fittings to the observed m-t curves is shown in the inset of Fig. . The c values are found to be ~(0.96-0.98). T 1long is of the order of 1 s and the origin of this longer relaxation time may be due to the existence of a small amount of impurity phase(s). Because T 1short is smaller than T 1long /10 even in the lowest temperature region, both kinds of T 1 can be reliably estimated. Hereafter, T 1 denotes the relaxation time T 1short corresponding to the main phase."

In this scenario one would expect to observe both a sharp T c and a robust T N weakly depending on oxygen doping as in the case of oxygen-doped La 2 CuO 4 .  However, the drastic decrease in 3D transition to long range magnetic order (T N decreasing from 186 K for NSC to 40 K for T c = 21 K sample) combined with relatively sharp magnetic transition [as in hole-doped La 2 CuO 4 demonstrates that this is not the case. The relatively broad SC transition is then a consequence of an intrinsic electronic inhomogeneity occurring on a length scale longer than the (short) SC coherence length.   While neutrons are a bulk probe and cannot determine how SC coexists with the AF phases at zero-field, magnetic field experiments show that the AF phase competes directly with SC .In this case, the observed commensurate quasi-2D SDW in PLCCO is analogous to the incommensurate 2D SDW in hole-doped La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 and La 2 CuO 4+δ . In the electron-doped case, the commensurate SDW may arise from the in-phase domains of ""stripes"" (22), as compared to the anti-phase domains of ""stripes"" in hole-doped materials .While a detailed picture of PLCCO may be obtained from future spin dynamical measurements, it appears that microscopic heterogeneity and the resulting competition of different order parameters are general features of doped copper oxides near a QPT ."

544,JPS0710709-CC,2,Cd 2 Re 2 O 7,1 ∼ 2 K,,specific heat,"A class of metal oxides isostructural to mineral pyrochlore has been attracting consid- erable attention because they exhibit a wide variety of interesting physical properties.  The pyrochlore has a general formula of A 2 B 2 O 7 , consisting of BO 6 octahedra and eightfold coordinated A cations, where A and B are transition metals and/or rare-earth elements.  In particular, the B sublattice can be viewed as a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra, providing a testing ground for studying the role of geometrical frustration in sys- tems which have local spins at B sites with antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation.Such systems are known to remain frustrated even when the exchange interaction is ferromagnetic (FM), provided that the spin correlation has local Ising anisotropy. Recent studies have revealed a rich variety of phenomena seemingly related to the geometrical frustration, such as the occurrence of a spin-glass (SG) phase in R 2 Mo 2 O 7 with R=Y, Tb and Dy , the unusual behavior of ordinary and anomalous Hall coefficients in the same compound with R=Nd, Sm and Gd , and the ""spin-ice"" phase in R 2 Ti 2 O 7 with R=Dy and Ho. Although metallic pyrochlores comprise a minority subgroup of the pyrochlore family, they consist of distinct members such as Tl 2 Mn 2 O 7 , which exhibits colossal magnetoresis- tance.   Moreover, the recently revealed superconductivity in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 , a 5d transition metal pyrochlore , demonstrates that the pyrochlores provide a fertile field for elec- tronic correlation adjacent to the perovskite compounds.   In this context, it is noteworthy that LiV 2 O 4 , a cubic spinel compound in which the V sublattice is isostructural to the B sublattice in pyrochlore, behaves similarly to a heavy fermion metal. It is reported that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 falls into the bulk superconducting state below T c ≃ 1 ∼ 2 K, as confirmed by a large jump of specific heat ∆C c as well as large diamagnetism due to the Meissner effect associated with the occurrence of zero resistivity.   The dc magnetization curve indicates that the superconductivity is of type II with the upper critical field close to 0.29 T at 0 K.The ratio ∆C c /γT c (with γ being the Sommerfeld constant) is reported to be 1.15, which is smaller than the predicted value of 1.43 for isotropic BCS superconductors.Unfortunately, these measurements were performed only above 0.4 K and are thus inconclusive in determining the detailed characteristics of superconductivity in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 .In this Letter, we report on the quasiparticle excitations in the mixed state of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 studied by muon spin rotation/relaxation (µSR).The magnetic penetration depth λ, which reflects the population of normal electrons (""quasiparticles"") in the superconductive state, is determined microscopically by measuring the muon spin relaxation due to the spatial inhomogeneity of magnetic induction in the flux line lattice (FLL).We show that the temperature dependence of λ is more or less consistent with the prediction based on the BCS superconductors with an isotropic gap, although a slight discrepancy is suggested by the detailed analysis."

The charge reservoir block commonly present in cuprates does not exist in the infinite-layer structure.  Second, the stoi-chiometric oxygen content without vacancies or intersti- tial oxygen .Third, n-type ILS have much higher T c ≃ 43 K compared to the n-type cuprates with T ′ -structure T c ≃ 25 K. Although n-type ILS have existed for quite a while, not many studies of their physical properties were performed because of the lack of high-quality sam- ples with a complete superconducting volume. Recently, high-quality n-type ILS samples of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 with a sharp superconducting transition T c ≃ 43 K were syn- thesized by using a cubic multi-anvil press ."

Magnetiza- tion measurements showed a single sharp superconduct- ing transition at T c ≃ 43 K and the saturation of the sus- ceptibility at low temperatures indicating the good sam- ple quality.   The µSR measurements were performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Switzerland) using low- momentum muons (29 MeV/c). A detailed discussion of the TF-µSR technique is given in where details of the application of the technique to the determination of λ can be found. shows TF-µSR muon-spin precession signals in an applied field of 600 mT above and below T c .For vi- sualization purposes the apparent precession frequencies are modified from the actual precession frequencies by the use of a rotating reference frame.  In the normal state above T c , the oscillation shows a small relaxation due to random local fields from nuclear magnetic moments. Below T c , the relaxation rate strongly increases due to the inhomogeneous field distribution of the flux line lat- tice. It is well known that in n-type cuprates there is a competition between the antiferromagnetically ordered state and superconductivity . The static magnetism, if present, could enhance the muon depolarization rate and falsify the interpretation of the TF-µSR results.   We have therefore carried out zero-field (ZF) µSR experi- ments to determine whether such static magnetism exists in SLCO.Typical ZF-µSR spectra are shown in for temperatures above and below T c . The ZF relaxation is exponential with a small relaxation rate 0.149(4) µs −1 and 0.184(5) µs −1 at 50 and 2.5 K, respectively. Thus, there is no evidence for the static magnetism in SLCO down to 2.5 K.Moreover, the ZF relaxation rate is small and changes very little between 50 and 2.5 K.Therefore, the increase in TF relaxation rate below T c is attributed entirely to the vortex lattice."

The HPO annealing was carried out in a cubic-anvil-type ultra-high-pressure apparatus at 5 GPa and 500 o C for 30 min. As an oxygen source, Ag 2 O 2 (that readily releases O 2 upon heating while decomposing via Ag 2 O to Ag) was utilized: Ag 2 O 2 was mixed with Co-1212 powder to a molar ratio of 1 : 2. XRD patterns for the HPO samples are shown in . Comparison with those for the AS samples (reveals that the HPO annealing had no effect on the phase purity of the samples. On the other hand, in where the lattice parameters are plotted for both the AS and the HPO samples, it is observed that upon HPO annealing the lattice drastically shrank along the b and c axes, whereas the a-axis parameter remained unchanged. As a consequence of the b-axis shrinkage, the degree of orthorhombic distortion decreases. We recognize the same from the fact that every pair of double peaks seen in the XRD pattern for the AS samples, e.g. 026 and 206, 136 and 316, 138 and 318, merges into a single peak after HPO annealings. This suggests that the CoO 4 tetrahedra have got broken as a consequence of the change in the oxygen amount/arrangement about the Co atom. For the HPO-annealed samples superconductivity appears with the transition temperature (T c ) up to 40 K (as determined at the onset of the diamagnetic signal) for the x = 0.3 sample.   The largest volume fraction of superconductivity (16 % from the ZFC data and 11 % from the FC data) is due to the x = 0.35 sample. In , we show the T c values for all the HPO samples as plotted against x.A bell-shape relation is seen.   In we have shown the χ vs. T curve for the x = 0.4 sample as an example.Now a question arises on the primary reason for the appearance of superconductivity in the HPO samples. To be able to reach the correct answer, we first investigated whether the pure high-pressure (HP) effect alone would induce superconductivity in the Ca-substituted CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+δ samples.As-synthesized powder with x = 0.4 was annealed without Ag 2 O 2 at 5 GPa and 500 o C for 30 min, i.e. under the condition otherwise the same as that employed for the HPO samples except that no excess oxygen source was added."

Therefore, it is likely that the weight/oxygen loss detected by TG upon N 2 annealing is primarily due to the Co-1212 phase itself.

Al- though they have quite different T c 's, one inter- esting feature in both dρ /dT vs. T curves is a common minimum and maximum observed at ∼ 200K and ∼ 150K.These very similar behaviors suggest that the same physics is in operation for the normal state in both samples. We noted that the Meissner effect signal size of δ = 0.032 sam- ple is larger than that of δ = 0.024 sample.This result indicates that the superconducting state in the δ = 0.032 sample is not due to the forma- tion of oxygen-rich phase.  A smaller Meissner effect is expected since there will be a smaller superconducting volume for samples chemically phase-separated into oxygen rich domains.In- deed, there are only two T c 's, one at ∼ 15 K and the other at ∼ 30 K, observed for the entire under- doped regime in the pure oxygen doped equilib- rium samples.This indicates, besides two chem- ical phases, that two T c's might be coming from two different electronic phases."

Since the oscillator strength of the single particle excitation may be approximated as S 2∆ ∼ πne 2 (1-n W m e /nm * )/2m e with n = n W + n F , the reduction in the dynamic mass of the lat- tice diminishes the oscillator strength as actually seen in their in-plane conductivities."

It is surprising therefore to find superconductivity (SC) with T c = 43 K in the optimal electron-doped infinite-layer cuprates Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 (M = La, Gd), which exhibit only a 16% difference between the a and c tetragonal lattice parameters.   The structure of Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 is the most basic among all high-T c cuprates, consisting entirely of CuO 2 sheets separated by rare-earth (RE) ions with tetragonal lattice parameters c = 3.41Å and a = 3.95Å. The recent success in producing high-quality polycrystalline samples of the infinite-layer cuprates with no observable impurity phases has en- gendered a renewed interest in these compounds.X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy indicate electron dop- ing, and bulk SC has been verified by powdered mag- netization (M ) measurements and specific heat (C) measurements (data presented later in this work). Sev- eral recent studies of these high purity polycrystalline samples suggest three-dimensional (3D) superconductiv- ity in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 .   Scanning tunnel spectroscopy (STS) measurements indicate an unconventional but isotropic s-wave superconducting gap with no pseudogap at zero field.   The s-wave symmetry of the gap is also sup- ported by specific heat measurements and Cu-site substi- tution studies,although it may be contradicted by NMR measurements. Kim et al estimated the c-axis coherence length (ξ c ) from a Hao-Clem analysis of the reversible magnetization of grain-aligned poly- crystal, and found that ξ c exceeds the spacing between the CuO 2 planes, indicating 3D superconductivity.On the other hand, they also find significant anisotropy be-tween magnetic fields H ≤ 5 T oriented parallel and per- pendicular to the CuO 2 planes, with an anisotropy ratio γ = ξ c /ξ ab = H ab c2 /H c c2 = 9.3, which is larger than γ = 5 observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ although much smaller than γ = 55 observed in optimally doped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8−δ . It is interesting to note that the only ma- jor crystallographic difference between the a-b and the c directions in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is the presence of oxygen in the a-b plane, which allows coupling of adjacent Cu spins and has been implicated as the cause of antiferro- magntic ordering or spin fluctuations in other members of the high-T c cuprate family, as well as a possible mech- anism for superconducting pairing.The importance of the CuO 2 planes to the SC in Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 is further supported by the fact that Ni substitution on the Cu site rapidly suppresses T c whereas out-of-plane Gd substitu- tion on the Sr site leaves T c unchanged.In this work we determine the upper critical field H c2 and the irreversibility field H irr of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 by means of magnetization and penetration depth measure- ments in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T in order to directly investigate the degree of upper critical field anisotropy and the role of vortex fluctuations.We also present specific heat (C) and magnetization (M ) mea- surements in low DC fields to 6 T as a function of tem- perature (T ) of Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2, confirming the bulk co- existence of Gd paramagnetism (PM) and SC.Our re- sults suggest strong confinement of the spin pairing wave function to the CuO 2 planes and significant field-induced superconducting fluctuations."

The irreversibility field H irr was identified from the onset of reversibility in the M (H) loops.  The penetration depth of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 was determined by measuring the frequency shift ∆f of a tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) resonant tank circuit with the sample contained in one of the component inductors. A ten turn 0.7 mm diameter aluminum coil was tightly wound around the sample with a filling factor of greater than 90%, with the coil axis oriented perpendicular to the pulsed field. To maintain temperature stability, the sample was thermally anchored to a sapphire plate and placed in 3 He exchange gas. Small changes in the resonant frequency can be related to changes in the penetration depth ∆λ by ∆λ = − R 2 rs ∆f f0 , where R is the radius of the coil and r s is the radius of the sample.In our case, R ∼ r s = 0.7 mm and the reference frequency f 0 ∼ 60 MHz such that ∆f = (0.16 MHz/µm)∆λ."

Note the negative θ obtained which is consistent with an AFM order. For R=Tb and Dy, the χ(T) curves have a PM-like behavior down to 5 K.  For R= Dy, the small contribution of the Mo AFM signal, (0.2 emu/mol Oe for R=Y see Fig. 5 inset), is probably masked by the high PM susceptibility of Dy 3+ . The P eff value obtained fits well the expected value of Dy 3 .  For R=Tb, P eff = 8.7 µ B deduced, is smaller than the 9.72 µ B expected for free ion Tb 3+ , suggesting that Tb has an intermediate valence-state, which also affects its magnetic behavior.This is reminiscent of the exception of the non-SC Tb123, among all other R123 materials.

At 5 K, for H> 3 T a tendency toward PM saturation (of Gd ions) is obtained. No magnetic transition is observed down to 1.8 K (Fig 4 inset).This is in contrast to Gd123, M-1212 (M=Ru and Mo) and Ru-1222 in which Gd is AFM ordered at 2.2-2.6 K.  (I) We may suggest that the peak at 11 K is related to the Gd sublattice and the highest transition i s due to the Mo layers. (II) A more preferable interpretation is that both transitions are related to the Mo sublattice, whereas the origin of the second one is not known yet.  Our supporting evidence is the fact, that in MoSr 2 GdCeCu 2 O 10 (Gd/Ce=1) both anomalies are absent (Fig. 4), suggesting that the two magnetic transitions are connected to each other. The PM values extracted for MoSr 2 GdCeCu 2 O 10 are:θ= -4.4 K and P eff = 7.85 µ B /Gd which fits well the theoretical value of 7.94 µ B /Gd. At the present moment we cannot explain as to why the R=Gd sample behaves so differently from all the rest of the heavy Mo-1222R compounds. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the behavior of Mo-1222 system is entirely different from Ru 5+ -1222 one.In Mo-1222 (Mo 5+ ), the physical state depends strongly on the ionic radii of the R ionst.  For large R ions, the samples are PM ). Once the a lattice parameter is contracted, SC in the CuO 2 planes is induced at T C ~ 20 K. Further contraction of a leads to an AFM order (at T N 13-26 K) in the Mo-O layers and to suppression of SC.The SC and AFM (which compete each other) states depend on the R/Ce ratio and both disappear for R/Ce=1.The magnetic behavior of the Gd sample is different.Neutron diffraction as well as MS on 155 Gd studies, are now being carried out to determine the magnetic structure of this system."

A polycrystalline sample was prepared using conventional solid-state reaction method in an evacuated silica tube.To control the oxygen partial pressure, a certain amount of AgO was added separately from the pellet in the tube: AgO decomposes into silver and oxygen above 370 K, and thus generates an oxidizing atmosphere.The chemical composition of the product examined by the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis in a scanning electron microscope was Cs:Os ~ 1:2. shows a powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern taken at room temperature.All the intense peaks can be indexed assuming a cubic unit cell with a lattice constant a = 1.0149 nm.A few extra peaks from Os are detected.Moreover, a trace of unknown impurity phase is also included in the product.Extinctions observed in the XRD pattern are consistent with the space group of m Fd3 , and the intensity profile is similar to the other β-pyrochlore oxides. The lattice constant is larger than those of RbOs 2 O 6 (a = 1.0114 nm) and KOs 2 O 6 (a = 1.0101 nm), as expected from the difference in the ionic radius of alkaline metal ions."

To our knowledge this was so far the first case that a p-type cuprate superconductor shows the Cu-O-Cu distance in the [CuO2] plane larger than 3.90 Å. It is once more an indication of the uniqueness of oxyhalide superconductors in comparing with the pure copper oxide HTS. Some compounds with the same 0201-type or similar structure (1201-type) exhibited insulating properties , which have larger a-axis than 3.90Å and contained large oxygen vacancy (20-75%) in the [CuO2] plane, resulting in the imperfect [CuO2] layers.  In contrast, the Rietveld refinements shown in suggests that the 0201-type Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y contained few oxygen vacancies, indicating that the [CuO2] sheet is rather perfect. So in order to induce superconductivity in the Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y samples, the key point is how to dope appropriate amount of mobile carriers into the [CuO2] sheets which should be perfect and keep the chemical stoichiometry.In addition, the energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis revealed that the average atomic ratio of Sr:Cu:Cl over tens of well grown grains was basically in agreement with the suggested Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl y formula.  At the same time, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction investigation on a large amount of crystals of the samples did not show the trace of other phases with the similar K 2 NiF 4 structure .So it is inferred that the observed 30 K bulk superconductiv- ity is caused by the apical oxygen doped Cl-0201 phase Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y."

640,hott2013review-CC,2,Mercury,below 4 K,,electrical resistance,"The discovery of superconductivity in 1911 came as the result of straightforward research to investigate the microscopic source of the electrical resistance of metals: Studies on alloys and temperature dependent measurements had evidenced that this could be decreased by reducing the density of impurity atoms as well as by lowering temperature. Mercury with its exceptionally low melting and boiling temperatures offered the best perspectives with respect to very low impurity levels.  Heike Kamerlingh Onnes had built at the University of Leiden a unique cryogenic facility where he was able to achieve substantially lower temperature than any other laboratory. This led him in 1911 to his famous experiment to see how low one can go concerning electrical resistance. The observed sudden jump to apparently zero resistivity below 4 K came nevertheless as a big surprise. Kamerlingh Onnes immediately recognized it as indication of a new state of matter. In 1933, the discovery of Walter Meißner and Robert Ochsenfeld that magnetic fields are expelled from a superconductor, demonstrated that superconductivity is actually a true thermodynamical state since in contrast to the situation for a merely perfect conductor this expulsion is independent of the experimental history ."

649,hott2013review-CC,7,NbTi,9.2 K,,,"After 1930, SC materials research was more or less in a hiatus until Bernd T. Matthias and John K. Hulm started in the early 1950s a extensive systematic search that delivered a number of new compounds with high T c well above 10 K as well as technically attractive B c2 well above 10 T. The most prominent examples of this crop were NbTi (T c = 9.2 K) and the A15 materials, A 3 B type intermetallic compounds, the materials basis for todays SC wire industry.    Having generated some 3000 different alloys in the 1950s and 1960s Matthias became a recognized wizard of the SC materials science.He condensed his huge practical knowledge into ""rules"" of how to prepare ""good"" superconductors: High crystal symmetry, high density of electronic states at the Fermi level, no oxygen, no magnetism, no insulators! In spite of his inofficial sixth rule ""Stay away from theorists!"", in 1957 the BCS theory brought up a desperately awaited breakthrough of theoretical solid state physics, a microscopic explanation of superconductivity. Due to the atomic bomb development, single isotope SC samples, e.g., mercury, had become available where the dependence of T c on the isotope mass pointed to a phonon-driven mechanism. John Bardeen realized that phonons introduce an attractive interaction between electrons close to the Fermi surface (""overscreening"").  The key idea of BCS theory is that even a tiny attractive interaction between these electrons leads to the formation of bound electron pair states (""Cooper pairs""). The electrons in these paired states are no longer obliged to obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, which enforces the electrons to occupy high kinetic energy single particle states due to the Pauli principle. The energy gain of the SC state with respect to the normal state does not result from the small binding energy of the pairs but it is the condensation energy of the pairs merging into a macroscopic quantum state.This results in an energy gap for electron excitations into single particle states. Although the BCS theory was derived from the physical idea of attractive electron-phonon coupling, the model-based weak pair coupling theory as its mathematical essence is well applicable to other pairing mechanisms.BCS theory had an impact not only on solid state physics but also on elementary particle physics where it was further developed to the idea of the Higgs mechanism of elementary particle mass generation (origins, impact and current state of the BCS theory are reviewed in )."
650,hott2013review-CC,10,,up to 138 K,normal pressure,,"The verdict of the Mermin-Wagner theorem that a long-range order can not exist in two dimensions at finite temperature due to the influence of fluctuations has long been believed to restrict superconductivity to the physical dimension d = 3. The cuprate ""high- temperature superconductors"" (""HTS"") discovered in 1986 proved that the limiting case d = 2+ε (ε→0), i.e., a scenario of basically two-dimensional CuO layer-oriented superconductivity with slight SC coupling to neighbouring CuO layers, can even be enormously beneficial for SC long-range order (the evolution of HTS is reviewed in ). The problem with the theoretical description of cuprate HTS within BCS theory and its extensions is not the high T c of up to 138 K under normal pressure , far above the pre-HTS record of 23 K :    According to the McMillan-Rowell formula , a commonly used T c approximation for the BCS superconductors, this HTS T c range is readily accessible with reasonable materials parameters .The real problem is that, in contrast to the ""deep"" Fermi sea of quasi-free electrons in classical metals where the Cooper-pair condensed electrons amount only to a small part of the valence electron system (k B T c << E Fermi ), in these layered cuprate compounds there is only a ""shallow"" reservoir of charge carriers (k B T c ~ E Fermi ) which first have to be introduced in the insulating antiferromagnetic (""AF"") stoichiometric parent compound by appropriate doping. Moreover, these charge carriers turn out to be complex physical objects in which strong Coulomb correlations connect their internal charge and spin degrees of freedom and for which Landau's quasiparticle concept of a description in terms of quasi-free electrons ""dressed"" by screening charge clouds no longer applies .  The normal charge transport based on these carriers corresponds to a ""bad/strange metal"" behaviour with a quite high electrical resistance which increases with temperature in a linear way without saturation up to the melting temperature, in stark contrast to the well-known saturating scattering behaviour of quasi-particles in a normal metal. Accordingly, the BCS recipe to express the SC wavefunction in terms of simple normal-metal single particle states does not work for cuprate HTS since the macroscopic many-particle wavefunction is thoroughly changing in the superconductive transition.Moreover, the strong connection of charge and spin degrees of freedom in the normal-conducting state paves the way for a plethora of other forms of broken symmetry, e.g. charge and spin density waves, which may compete or cooperate with superconductivity .A satisfactory theoretical description has not yet been achieved but the SC instability in cuprate HTS, as well as in the structurally and chemically related layered ruthenate and cobaltate compounds, is believed to stem predominantly from a magnetic and not from a phononic interaction as in the case of the classical metallic superconductors where magnetism plays only the role of an alternative, intrinsically antagonistic long range order instability."

In both materials the conduction electrons stem from partially filled d-bands (of the Ru or Cu ions, respectively) that are strongly hybridized with oxygen p-orbitals.In contrast to the nearly filled Cu 3d-shell in cuprate HTS with only one hole state, in Sr 2 RuO 4 , in the formal oxidation state of the ruthenium ion Ru 4+ four electrons are left in the 4d-shell.The closely related ferromagnetic material SrRuO 3 shows the inherent tendency of Ru 4+ towards ferromagnetism.Hence, in analogy with the cuprate HTS, where on doping the AF ground state of the parent compounds seems to ""dissolve"" in spin-singlet Cooper pairs in a d-wave orbital channel, it was suggested that the superconductivity in Sr 2 RuO 4 is brought about by spin-triplet pairing where the Ru ions ""release"" parallel-spin, i.e., triplet Cooper pairs in p-wave or even higher odd order angular orbital channels."

The large enhancement of the specific heat is also reflected in the quadratic temperature coefficient A of the resistivity A ~ γ 2 . These features indicate that the normal state can be described in terms of a Fermi liquid. The excitations determining the low-temperature behavior correspond to heavy quasiparticles whose effective mass * m is strongly enhanced over the free electron mass m. The characteristic temperature * T which can be considered as a fictitious Fermi temperature or, alternatively, as an effective band width for the quasiparticles is of the order 10 -100 K. Residual interactions among the heavy quasiparticles lead to instabilities of the normal Fermi liquid state. A hallmark of these systems is the competition or coexistence of various different cooperative phenomena which results in highly complex phase diagrams. Of particular interest are the SC phases which typically form at a critical temperature T c ≤ 2 K.  PuCoGa 5 with T c ~ 18.5 K is up to now the only ""high-T c "" HF representative ."

The simple tetragonal AF order with wave vector in c-direction has tiny moments µ ~ 0.02 µ B along c-axis which are of the same order as in UPt 3 .However, unlike in UPt 3 , very large thermodynamic effects, e. g., in specific heat, thermal expansion etc., occur which are hard to reconcile with the small ordered moments. These pronounced anomalies were interpreted as evidence for the presence of a second ""hidden order"" parameter, which cannot be seen in neutron or x-ray diffraction. In the itinerant models the order parameter is due to an unconventional pairing in the particle-hole channel leading to an unconventional SDW which has vanishing moment in the clean limit and also does not break time reversal invariance.   The small staggered moments may then be induced in the condensate due to impurity scattering.Finally, in the dual models one assumes a localized singlet-singlet system in interaction with the itinerant electrons to cause induced moment magnetism with small moments but large anomalies.In all models it was previously taken for granted that both the primary ""hidden"" order parameter and AF order coexist homogeneously within the sample.However, hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure experiments have radically changed this view, showing that the order parameters exist in different parts of the"

Pressure was found to enhance T c for samples in the underdoped region, i.e. dT c /dx > 0; to suppress T c for samples in the overdoped region where dT c /dx < x; and to affect T c only slightly for the optimally doped sample, very different from the case of Hg1223 .The observations suggest that the maximum T c of the R1111 may not exceed 50's K and that the lower-than-50's K observed then in R1111 may rise to the 50's K should the sample conditions be optimized. Unfortunately, the highest T c observed in superconducting Fe-pnictides to date has not exceeded 55 K, although the then lower-than-50 K-T c was raised to above 50 K.  Pressure was also found to suppress the magnetic transition temperature T o , consistent with the positive pressure effect on T c of the underdoped samples and with the doping effect on T o .Later, more high pressure experiments were made on the R1111 phase compounds .They demonstrated the close relationship between magnetism and superconductivity, the ability to raise the T c of close to optimally doped R1111 up to 45 K rapidly below ~ 5 GPa followed by a slow T c -drop at higher pressures and the possibility to induce superconductivity in the undoped parent R1111 with a rapid T c up to ~ 25 K."

Their ambient onset T c 's are 28 K and 9 K for the x = 0.11 and 0.05 samples, respectively. The pressure was generated in a BeCu piston-cylinder cell up to 3 GPa hydrostatically and up to 30 GPa in a diamond anvil cell quasi-hydrostatically.   The ρ(T)'s of the x = 0.11 and 0.05 samples are shown in Figs. 5a and b at different pressures. The onset-T c of the x = 0.11 sample, as defined in Fig. 5a, increases steeply from 28 K to 43 K with pressure up to 3 GPa at a large initial rate dT c /dP ~ + 8 K/GPa and then drops off slowly to 9 K at 30 GPa at a rate dT c /dP ~ -1.4 K/GPa as shown in Fig. 6.The onset-T c of the sample of x = 0.05 was also found to increase with pressure but at a slower rate of + 2.0 K/GPa below 3 GPa where the experiment stops (Fig. 7 and inset). The experiment did show that the T c of La(O 1- x F x )FeAs with F-doping can be raised to a maximum of 43 K by the joint effects of chemical (F- doping) and pressure doping.

The maximum T c = 38 K takes place at x ~ 0.4 -0.5.    Possible coexistence of SDW and the superconducting states is apparent between x ~ 0.2 and 0.3.The phase diagram makes possible the systematic study of the x-dependence of the pressure coefficient of T c of the 122 series. It should be noted that this was the first complete T c (x)-phase diagram of Fe-pnictides available at the time.We have, therefore, measured ρ(T) and χ ac (T) under hydrostatic pressures up to 1.7 GPa, for different x's to cover the three major regions of hole-doping [10, 15, 29].  The T c (P) for samples with x = 0.2 (underdoped), 0.4 (~ optimally-doped) and 0.7 (overdoped) are given in Fig. 13.   It is unambiguously shown that dT c /dP is positive for the underdoped sample, close to zero for the optimally doped sample and negative for the overdoped sample, in agreement with the prediction of the universal T c (x)- relation proposed for the hole-doped cuprate HTSs as discussed in section 2.1.The observation can be summarized as: dT c /dP > 0 in the region where dT c /dx > 0; dT c /dP ~ 0 where dT c /dx ~ 0; and dT c /dP < 0 where dT c /dx < 0, suggesting that pressure promotes holes.The pressure study on electron-doped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs suggests that pressure generates electrons.Based on these two studies, one may conclude that symmetry between the electron-and hole-dopings exists in Fe- pnictide superconductors, in agreement with the earlier observation by Wen et al. .It should be noted that pressure suppresses the SDW transition in the hole-doped (Sr 1-x K x )Fe 2 As 2 ), just as in the electron-doped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs."

The ρ(T)'s at different pressures are shown in Fig. 14. At ambient pressure, ρ(T) decreases with temperature initially, rises abruptly at T o ~ 170 K indicating the onset of a first-order structural (T-O) transition coinciding with the antiferromagnetic transition, and continues to drop afterward. No superconductivity was detected to ~ 0.6 K. Under small pressures up to 0.35 GPa the structural transition is broadened and T o pushed down to 130 K continuously (blue dots in ). However, at pressures > 0.35 GPa, a new ρ-anomaly appears with a clear ρ-drop on cooling over a certain temperature-range, signaling the entrance to a new phase transition (cT). The anomaly becomes clearer with pressure as its temperature is shifted to higher temperature (red dots in . The new transition (T-cT) is found thermally hysteretic like the structural transition at T o . A ρ-drop at ~ 12 K indicative of the beginning of a superconducting transition was evident at 0.23 GPa and zero-ρ was also achieved but only within a narrow pressure region between 0.35 and 0.55 GPa."

The ρ value at room temperature is ∼28 µΩ cm, which lies in between that of pure Sn and pure Sb .  With decreasing temperature, ρ decreases linearly down to ∼50 K and then varies as T 2.4 at lower temperature, which is typical of a normal metal.Nevertheless, the low residual resistivity ratio (ρ 300K /ρ 3K ) of ∼2.6 suggests the presence of significant disorder scattering, likely due to antisite occupation between Sn and Sb. On further cooling below 2.8 K, ρ drops rapidly to zero, evidencing a transition to the superconducting state [inset of Fig. ]. Here we define T ρ c = 2.48 K as the temperature corresponding to the midpoint of the resistive drop.  On the other hand, as shown in Fig. , the Hall resistivity depends linearly on the magnetic field, and the corresponding Hall coefficient is negative and nearly temperature independent.

As can be seen in Fig. , c p varies smoothly across T ρ c while exhibits a sharp jump at ∼1.6 K. With increasing field, the specific heat jump shifts towards lower temperature and becomes broadened, consistent with a superconducting transition. At 500 Oe, the anomaly is almost suppressed, and the data can be analyzed by the Debye model c p /T = γ n + β 3 T 2 + β 5 T 4 , where γ n and β i (i = 3, 5) are the electronic and phonon specific- heat coefficients, respectively.  The best fit to the data below 3 K yields γ n = 2.29 mJ mol −1 K −2 , β 3 = 0.43 mJ mol −1 K −4 , and β 5 = 0.009 mJ mol −1 K −6 .Once β 3 is known, the Debye temperature Θ D can be calculated using the equation Θ D = (12π 4 NR/5β 3 ) 1 , where N = 2 and R is the molar gas constant 8.314 J/mol K. This gives Θ D = 208 K for SnSb. On the other hand, as shown in the inset of Fig. , the c p value exceeds the Dulong-Petit limit of 3NR = 49.88 J/mol K at temperatures above 200 K, suggesting that all the phonons are excited in this temperature range. Hence one may estimate Θ D ∼ 200 K, in good agreement with the above calculation."

More importantly, it turns out that the C el /γ n T jump can be reproduced by the BCS theory , especially at low temperature region, and the entropy balance determines the bulk superconducting transition temperature T bulk c = 1.50 K.  This suggests that SnSb is fully gapped with a conventional s-wave pairing symmetry and a zero temperature gap value ∆(0) = 0.22 meV.Nevertheless, since the data is limited to T /T bulk c ≥ 0.34, the possibility of multiband SC with a very small gap in one of the bands cannot be ruled out.

A similar enhancement is likely to occur in spark-eroded ZrZn 2 at any regions of the superconducting layer that are thin compared to the penetration depth."

It is well known that the intro- duction of rare earth ions to the La site tends to sta- bilize the LTT structure . In La 1.8−x Eu 0.2 Sr x CuO 4 , by introducing 10% of Eu for La, the LTT phase is sta- bilized over a wide range of hole concentration from x = 0 to 0.3 .   This provides a unique opportunity to observe the stripe criticality in the absence of the first order LTO-LTT phase transition.More interestingly, the underdoped side of the superconducting dome in the phase diagram gives a way to a ""stripe"" magnet, as if the superconducting phase were replaced with the ""stripe"" phase , as schematically shown in the inset of Fig- ure . As a result, an intriguing phase competition between the stripe phase and the superconducting phase appears around a critical composition of x = 0.16 which appears as a bicritical point. It should be emphasized that the boundary is located away from the 1/8 anomaly, which implies that commensurability is less important.  La 1.64 Eu 0.2 Sr 0.16 CuO 4 single crystals in critical vicin- ity to the phase boundary were grown by a traveling sol- vent floating zone (TSFZ) technique . Three dif- ferent samples were cut from the same crystalline rod. At ambient pressure, all the crystals showed superconduct- ing transition at around 10 K.

The data clearly demonstrate that the anisotropy of the uniaxial pressure effect exists not only between the in-plane and the out-of-plane directions but also within the tetragonal CuO 2 planes. As seen in , the superconduct- ing transition shifts to a lower temperature with increas- ing pressure applied along [001]. In remarkable contrast, T c increases when the pressure is applied parallel to the CuO 2 planes (both the [100] and the [110] directions), as shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c).  This contrast between the in-plane pressure and the out-of-plane pressure has been known for many years. A substantial change of T c , associated with anisotropic pressure induced by epitaxial strain, was observed in underdoped La 2−x Sr(Ba) x CuO 4 thin films .  In the case of films on LaSrAlO 4 sub- strate, a substantial increase of T c up to 50 K was ob- served.The LaSrAlO 4 substrate has a slightly smaller in- plane lattice constant than those of bulk La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 , which results in the in-plane compression and the out-of- plane expansion of the La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 film.  The rapid in- crease of T c has been ascribed to such an epitaxial strain effect.Consistent with this, a substantial decrease of T c was observed for SrTiO 3 substrate with a large lattice"

874,EPL0490086-CC,9,Bi2223,110 K,,,"We discuss now the origin of the contribution to the pseudogap, which disappears at T 0 with the increase of temperature. This contribution can be explained by the disappearance of the CDW or/and SDW order(s), or incoherent Cooper pairs. From the common sense, the CDW or SDW order is likely to be appear above T c and not to disappear. Consequently, it is most likely that this contribution to the pseudogap is made by preformed pairs . Tunneling spectroscopy is sensitive exclusively to the magnitude of the order parameter. Thus, if the humps originate from the presence of preformed pairs, then the magnitude of the gap-like structure reflects the average value of binding energy per particle . However, our results alone cannot prove that this contribution originates from preformed pairs. We can argue that high-frequency conductivity measurements showed that the incoherent Copper pairs remain well above T c in Bi2212, and it was predicted by the theory .  It is also in agreement with a MCS (Magnetic Coupling between Stripes) model proposed very recently . There is also an alternative explanation for the presence of this contribution to the pseudogap, it is possible that this contribution originates from the presence of the Bi2223 phase with T c = 110 K. Even in this case, our data obtained in SIS junctions support in general the conclusions made on the basis of tunneling data in SIN junctions, namely, that the pseudogap is directly related to superconductivity ."

As is widely known, high T C cuprates have also layered structures with 2D CuO 2 planes which play an essential role in the high T C superconductivity.

While certain experiments indicated an unexpected type-I superconducting phase, other experiments re- vealed formation of vortices under the application of magnetic fields. Recently, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed the existence of a mixed phase where type-I and type-II behaviours coexist. Here, based on our temperature and magnetic field dependent STS experiments on Cu-intercalated PdTe2 we show that as the critical temperature of the superconducting phase goes up from 1.7 K to 2.4 K on Cu-intercalation, the mixed phase disappears and the system be- comes homogeneously type-II.  This may be attributed to an averaging effect caused by quasiparticle exchange between type-I and type-II domains mediated by the Cu atoms and to decreased coherence length due to increased disorder."
909,1903.04321-CC,2,PdTe 2,below 1.7 K,,,"The candidate type II Dirac semimetal PdTe 2 superconducts below 1.7 K .  Though initial experi- mental papers suggested the possibility of an unconven- tional nature of the superconducting phase of PdTe 2 , a number of experiments confirmed that the superconduc- tivity in PdTe 2 is conventional in nature .  How- ever, some of these experiments found evidence of type I behaviour as far as the magnetic properties of the su- perconducting phase of PdTe 2 are concerned .These contradicted with certain other experiments where the magnetic properties were found to be consistent with type II superconductivity .  More recently, magnetic field dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy exper- iments revealed coexistence of type I and type II do- mains in PdTe 2 where such an inhomogeneity of the su- perconducting phase was attributed to electronic inho- mogeneities observed in the normal state of PdTe 2 . It turned out that the electronic inhomogeneity could alter the local electron density and the local coherence length thereby leading to a distribution of the Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gorkov (GLAG) parameter (κ) over the surface of PdTe 2 .  Within this picture, it should be possible to disorder the system so that inter-domain scattering of the quasiparticles can average out the κ dis- tribution and make the system homogeneous.In this pa- per, we report the observation of such averaging effect in Cu-PdTe 2 by magnetic field dependent scanning tun- neling spectroscopy experiments.The superconducting phase becomes homogeneously type II while the critical temperature gets enhanced at randomly distributed do- mains on the surface due to random distribution of the intercalates ."

Such measurements on polycrystalline samples indicated that the higher T c in Cu-PdTe 2 is due to enhanced electron-phonon coupling parameter (λ ph ) and increased density of states upon Cu- intercalation.  For the spectroscopic measurements presented in this paper we used high quality single crys- tals of Cu-intercalated PdTe 2 with 4% Cu in the crys- tals. The shiny single crystals were first mounted in a ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cleaving stage integrated with the STM.  The crystals were then cleaved at 80 K us- ing a cleaver attached to an UHV manipulator.After cleaving, the crystals were immediately transferred to the STM head which is cooled down to 310 mK using a H 3 -based cryostat. The sample is placed at the center of a solenoidal superconducting magnet with a maximum field strength of 11 Tesla. All the STM/S experiments re- ported in this paper were performed with sharp metallic tips of tungsten (W). The tips were fabricated by electro- chemical etching and were cleaned by electron beam bom- bardment under UHV in a preparation chamber attached to the STM prior to the low temperature experiments. The formation of the superconducting phase with T c = 2.6 K is seen in the susceptibility versus temperature data presented in (b)."

A negative pressure effect on Tc with dTc/dp = −0.0225(3) K/kbar was observed. The electron-phonon coupling constant λ el−ph decreases with increasing pressure with d ln λ el−ph /dp ≃ −0.20%/kbar.The magnetic field penetration depth λ was studied in the Meissner state and, therefore, probes only the surface of the sample.  The absolute values of λ and the superconducting energy gap at ambient pressure and zero temperature were found to be λ(0) =140(30) nm and ∆0 =1.251(9) meV, respectively. ∆0 scales linearly with Tc as 2∆0/kBTc = 4.79. The studies of the pressure effect on λ reveal that λ −2 increases with pressure with d ln λ −2 (0)/dp = 0.60(23) %/kbar.This effect can not be explained within the framework of conventional adiabatic electron-phonon pairing, suggesting that close to the surface, an unconventional non-adiabatic character of the electron-phonon coupling takes place."

The grain size dis-tribution was determined by analyzing scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs. The hydrostatic pres- sure was generated in a copper-beryllium piston cylin- der clamp especially designed for magnetization measure- ments under pressure . The sample was mixed with Fluorient FC77 (pressure transmitting medium) with a sample-to-liquid volume ratio of approximately 1/6. The pressure dependence of T c was taken from a separate set of magnetization experiments where a small piece of in- dium [T c (p = 0) = 3.4 K] with known T c (p) dependence was added to the sample and both T c 's of indium and ZrB 12 were recorded.

913,P072224509-CC,8,ZrB 12,6.09(2) K,,,"In order to obtain the value of the superconducting gap ∆, the data have also been analyzed by means of the BCS model. For clean superconductor the temperature dependence of λ −2 can be described in the following way : where F = (1 + exp(E/k B T ) −1 is the Fermi function, ∆(T ) = ∆ 0 •∆(T /T c ) represents the temperature de- pendence of the energy gap, and ∆ 0 is the zero tem- perature value of the superconducting gap.∆(T /T c ) is the normalized gap taken from Ref. . The best fit to the data using Eq. gives T c = 6.09(2) K, λ −2 (0) = 47.4(2) nm, and ∆ 0 = 1.251(9) meV.  The ra- tio 2∆ 0 /k B T c = 4.77(4) is found, suggesting that ZrB 12 is a strong coupled BCS superconductor. Note, that a rather close value 2∆ 0 /k B T c ≃ 4.8 has been obtained in point-contact spectroscopy and tunnelling ex- periments. From the other hand a smaller value ≃3.7 has been reported by Lortz et al. using the heat- capacitance technique, thus suggesting a weak coupling strength. This difference has been already pointed out by Tsindlekht et al. . It was explained by enhanced surface characteristics of the ZrB 12 leading to rather dif- ferent superconducting properties of bulk and surface .  Our measurements were performed in the Meissner state, with the field penetrating on a dis- tance λ from the surface and, therefore, give a value of the superconducting gap consistent with those one reported in the surface sensitive experiments .To estimate the uncertainty in the absolute value of λ(0) we used a procedure similar to that one described in Refs. . The temperature dependence of λ(T ) was calculated for N (R) + N (R) and N (R) − N (R) distributions. The fit of the resulting λ(T ) curves with the power law as well as with the BCS model gives λ(0) in the range from 110 to 170 nm. shows the pressure dependence of λ −2 (0) obtained by fitting the reconstructed λ(T ) data at dif- ferent pressures with the BCS model [Eq. ]. In these experiments we studied relative effects measured on the same sample in the same pressure cell. The main system- atic error of these measurements comes from misalign- ments of the experimental setup occurring when the cell is removed from the SQUID magnetometer, to change the pressure, and put back again. This procedure was checked with a set of measurements at constant pressure. The systematic scattering of the magnetization data is about 0.3%, giving a relative error in λ −2 (T ) of about 3%. The reducing of the grain size with pressure was taken into account in λ(T ) calculation [Eq. (4)], by using the bulk modulus reported above. The linear fit yields λ −2 (0) = 48.4(7)+ 0.29p implying that λ −2 increases under pressure with d ln λ −2 (0)/dp = 0.60(23)%/kbar [see ]."

Using the deoxygenated sample to subtract the phonon contribution, we find a broad peak in the specific heat, centered at 50 K. This excess specific heat is attributed to fluctuations of the Cu spins possibly enhanced by an interplay with the charge degrees of freedom, and appears to be independent of magnetic field, up to 15 T.  Near the superconducting transition Tc(H=0)= 43 K, we find a sharp feature that is strongly suppressed when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the crystallographic c-axis.

According to neutron scattering and muon-spin rotation experiments, there is a well-defined phase transition to the magnetically- ordered state at T m = T c .This magnetic order is 2- dimensional with the out-of-plane correlation length of order 3 Cu-O planes.   Above T m , in the paramagnetic phase, there is evidence for long-coherence-length, low- energy spin fluctuations.By applying a magnetic field, which suppresses the superconducting order parameter, the magnetic order parameter grows.This indicates that there is a competition between the magnetic order and superconductivity, in spite of the close proximity of T m and T c."

Indeed, we identified a small anomaly due to the superconducting transition. However, we did not observe any anomaly associated with the simultaneous onset of the static incommensurate magnetic order neither in the absence nor in the presence of the applied field of up to 15 T.This could be due to one of the following reasons: a) the entropy recovered at the magnetic ordering tem- perature is quite small, as in the parent compound, 28 b) the entropy is significant but distributed over a broad temperature range.

Our single crystal x-ray diffraction characterization shows, in agreement with earlier work, that WB 4.2 crystallizes in the space group P6 3 /mmc (No. 194) and has a crystal structure that is derived from the simple diborides but with a systematic W-deficiency-B 3 substitution-each missing W atom in the 2b position is replaced by three B atoms in the 6h position.  Different experiments show sharp and reproducible superconducting transitions at about 2 K for WB 4.2 . Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements were used to characterize the superconductor. WB 4.2 is a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type superconductor with an upper critical magnetic field, H c2 (0), that is between that predicted by the standard WHH equation and the result of using a linear extra- polation of H c2 (T) to zero temperature."

Using β, the Debye temperature (Θ D ) is calculated to be 780(10) K using the equation where R is the ideal gas constant 8.314 J mol −1 K −1 and n=5.2 for WB 4.2 . The Debye temperature is high, which reflects a high concentration of boron (for which Θ D =1300 K ) in the material.

C el was obtained by subtracting the phonon contribution to the specific heat: C el =C p − βT 3 .  The T c is estimated to be 2.05 K for this data using an equal-area entropy construction (solid black lines), which is close to the critical temperature from the temperature- dependent magnetic susceptibility measurement. Such a large peak in the specific heat due to a significant loss of entropy is an explicit indication that the bulk material is superconducting. The normalized specific heat jump, ΔC/γT c , is estimated as 1.56 for WB 4.2 , which is near the weak coupling BCS limit of 1.43 and confirms that WB 4.2 is a bulk superconductor. shows C el − γ 0 T versus T c /T for WB 4.2 in the superconducting state under zero applied magnetic field and fitted to the following equation where γ 0 T is the electronic contribution to the specific heat originating from impurities in the sample, Δ 0 is the super- conducting gap magnitude, and k B is the Boltzmann constant.The Δ 0 for WB 4.2 was calculated to be Δ 0 =0.22 meV and according to BCS theory , it is expected to be for a weak coupling superconductor.The calculated value of the superconducting gap Δ 0 =0.22 meV (2Δ 0 =0.44 meV) is less than the weak coupling BCS value of 2Δ 0 =0.62 meV."

The resulting μ 0 H c2 (0) for WB 4.2 is therefore most likely somewhere between the linear extrapolation to 0 K (0.71 T) and that predicted by the WHH model (0.47 T).Taking μ 0 H c2 (0)=0.71 T as the upper limit, the approximate coherence length can be calculated by using the Ginzburg-Landau formula ξ GL (0)={f 0 /[2πH c2 (0)]} 1/2 , where f 0 =h/2e and is found to be ξ GL (0)=26 nm.All physical parameters for WB 4.2 are gathered in table 3."

The inset shows the diamagnetic transition at around 27.4 K de- termined by the crossing point of the extrapolating line of the most steep part with the normal state background M = 0.  In low temperature region the curves are rather linear showing that the major part is due to phonon contribu- tion C ph = βT 3 + δT 5 .It is known that the phonon part is independent on the magnetic field, this allows to remove the phonon contribution by subtracting the C/T at a certain field with that at zero field. The results af- ter the substraction are shown in . The subtracted values ∆γ = γ(H) − γ(0) = [C(T, H) − C(T, H = 0)]/T exhibit a rather linear T dependence in low temperature region. One can also see that the negative slope is actu- ally field dependent. In the following we will show that the field dependent slope of the linear part in low tem- perature region shown in directly deviates from the Simon-Lee 18 scaling law. According to Simon-Lee scaling law C vol /T √ H = f (T / √ H), in low temperature region, the Volovik's rela- tion restores, thus one has C vol /T = A √ H and further has This clearly shows that there is a negative slope for ∆γ vs. T , but the slope α is a constant. However, from one can see that the slope changes slightly with the magnetic field H. This indicates that only the Volovik's relation is not enough to interpret the data. In the fol- lowing we will take both the core size effect and finite temperature effect into account. The former has not been considered in the original Simon-Lee scaling law since the size of the vortex core was thought to be small, and the contribution from that small region is negligible. If the vortex core size becomes bigger, this should be reconsid- ered when counting the DOS due to the Doppler shift effect."

Although strongly correlated systems are beyond the scope of the Kohn-Sham scheme of the DFT, many successful attempts have been made to deal with the description of superconducting materials. In particular, some specific properties of the normal state, e.g. electronic band dispersions and electronic density of states, are very useful to elucidate aspects of the superconducting mechanism and to predict relevant parameters, such as the critical temperature T c and the electron-phonon coupling constant λ. In the last few years, an increasing number of studies appeared using this methodology, either as support for experimental discoveries or fully theoretical investigations . Superconductivity was recently experimentally reported, by some of the present authors, for the HfV 2 Ga 4 compound, with a critical temperature (T c ) of 4.1 K .   The investi- gators observed some deviations from the more conventional BCS theory signatures, such as an unusual inflection near T c in lower and upper critical field as a function of reduced temperature, and a second jump in the specific heat vs. temperature curve. The authors speculated that the experimental results could be either due to sample inhomogeneity or to the presence of more than one superconducting gap at the Fermi surface, resulting in a two-band superconductivity .These recent experimental results for the bulk HfV 2 Ga 4 point to a new promising class of materials to study unconventional superconducting behavior.   Motivated by these results, here we perform ab-initio electronic structure calculations for HfV 2 Ga 4 .We focus our atten- tion on the analysis of the possible mechanisms behind the superconducting properties.The theoretical study was extended to a new (possibly) bulk superconducting compound with the same prototype structure, ScV 2 Ga 4 , as a way to manipulate the electronic structure aiming at enhancing the superconducting transition temperature."

Since YBCO contains Cu-O chains which can carry the electric current along the b- axis, we measure the magnetic-field dependence of the a-axis resistivity ρ a and pay particular attention to sort- ing out the genuine MR behavior of the CuO 2 planes with a careful analysis involving also the b-axis resistivity ρ b and the Hall resistivity ρ H . Based on the magnetocon- ductivity of the CuO 2 planes obtained after the analysis, we discuss both the normal-state magnetoconductivity at high temperatures and the FMC at lower temperatures. Most notably, the FMC is found to show a non-monotonic evolution with y and its y-dependence suggests that the superconductivity is anomalously weakened in the ""60-K phase"" of YBCO; in combination with other in-plane transport properties which suggest that the hole doping is actually 1/8 at y ≃ 6.65, the present data give evidence for the 1/8-anomaly origin of the 60-K plateau."
969,L088167005-CC,5,y=6.50,35 K,,,"Figure 1(a) shows the ρ a (T ) data for the series of our untwinned crystals. An unusual overlapping of the ρ a (T ) data for the ""60-K phase"" samples, which is clear in (a), has been discussed in Ref. . shows examples of the raw MR (∆ρ a ) data for y=7.0. All the data plotted in show the ordinary H 2 depen- dence, which becomes clear in the plot of ∆ρ a vs H 2 []. In the underdoped samples, however, we ob- served that the MR starts to become concave downward (or tends to saturate) in the ∆ρ a vs H 2 plot upon ap- proaching T c , as shown in (d) for y=6.50 (T c =35 K).   Such H-dependence is most likely caused by a de- crease in the characteristic magnetic-field scale to sup- press superconducting fluctuations, and some vortex fluc- tuations in the pseudogap state are possibly in- volved in this anomaly.In any case, when this anomalous H-dependence is observed near T c , the MR data cannot be discussed on the same ground as those at higher tem- peratures, and therefore we do not include the MR data for temperatures very close to T c in the discussions after- wards. However, as long as the temperature is not very close to T c , the low-field part of ∆ρ a can reasonably be fitted with H 2 [as shown for the 50-K data in ] and for such data we determine the ""magnitude"" of MR from the low-field slope of the ∆ρ a vs H 2 plot. shows the summary of the transverse and lon- gitudinal MR ([∆ρ a /ρ a ] ⊥ and [∆ρ a /ρ a ] / , respectively) for the whole doping range.  In , one may notice that the longitudinal MR rapidly diminishes with increas- ing temperature in highly-doped samples (y=6.95 and 7.0), while it remains noticeable up to 270 K in the under- doped samples.While the low-temperature growth of the longitudinal MR is likely to originate from the Zeeman term in the FMC, its behavior in the high-temperature region is expected to reflect the properties of the normal-"

Re- cently, novel concepts on pairing symmetry of n-and p-type cuprates have come forward: a possible transition in pairing symmetry and/or a mixed symmetry order parameter.  Our previous work in- volved La 2−x Ce x CuO 4−δ (LCCO) and Pr 2−x Ce x CuO 4−δ (PCCO) films grown directly on SrTiO 3 substrates. We found that at low Ce doping levels, λ −2 (T ) at low T was quadratic in T , but at higher dopings, λ −2 (T ) showed ac- tivated behavior. These results suggested a d-to s-wave pairing transition near optimal doping, as was also sug- gested by tunneling experiments on PCCO films.  We have subsequently improved film quality by eliminating the interface between the film and substrate, by grow- ing PCCO films onto Pr 2 CuO 4 (PCO)/SrTiO 3 instead of directly onto SrTiO 3 .The insulating PCO layer is thought to lessen lattice mismatch between PCCO film and SrTiO 3 substrate, so that these films should be more homogeneous through their thickness.  In fact, their nor- mal state resistivities are somewhat lower than those of unbuffered PCCO films for the same doping, x.T c 's at optimal doping in the two film families are the same, T c ≃ 24 K."

The data show that the material is a bulk superconductor, with superconducting characteristics similar to that of the double-layer cobaltate. In the three-layer system, however, we reproducibly observed a dependence of the superconducting properties on length of hydration time. Figure shows characteristic data illustrating this effect.  In this set of experiments, anhydrous sodium cobaltate of nominal composition Na 0.3 CoO 2 , obtained in a 40X reaction with bromine, was placed in a hydration chamber where the hydration process is accomplished at ambient temperature on exposure to an atmosphere of 100% relative humidity.A small portion of the sample was removed in daily intervals for testing. The figure shows that the initial T c is in the range of 3K. The T c then increases to the optimal value, where it is stable for several days.  Tc then degrades on further storage in the hydration atmosphere.  Powder X-ray diffraction characterization of the material indicated that the three-layer Na 0.30 CoO 2 •1.3H 2 O superconducting phase is present and single-phase to our experimental sensitivity for the duration of these experiments.Therefore the chemical changes that are taking place to yield the observations in figure do not involve decomposition of the superconducting phase but rather subtle structural or chemical changes.  One possibility is that some Na may be leached out of the superconductor into the surrounding intergrain water over a period of several days 6 , 7 an effect that is accelerated for hydration by immersion in large volumes of liquid water. The observed change in Tc may therefore represent the leaching of a slightly Na rich composition through the optimal composition to a Na poor composition over a period of a week, tracing out the narrow peak in Tc vs.Na content .The lower chemical stability of the three- layer superhydrate at ambient conditions may be what allows this effect to be observed on a short laboratory time scale, but the general similarity of the chemistry of the phases suggests that this is may occur to a smaller degree in the two-layer superconductor as well."

Polycrystalline samples of La 1.78 Sr 0.22 Cu 1-x Ni x O 4 with nominal x=0, 0.01, and 0.02 were carefully prepared from La 2 O 3 , SrCO 3 , and CuO powder of 99.999% purity.

The substrate temperature dependence of orientation and superconducting poperties were systematically studied. Good quality c and a-axis orientated films can be obtained on SrTiO 3 via changing the substrate temperature solely. On YSZ, films with good c-axis orientation can be grown, while it is hard to grow films with good a-axis orientation by changing substrate temperature alone. The highest T C0 is about 37K, which is found in the films grown on YSZ with a good c-axis orientation.  For the films grown on STO, however, the highest T C0 is about 35.6K with a mixed orientation of c-axis and a-axis. In most of the superconducting films, the weak temperature dependence of the normal state resistivity, as characterized by small R(290K)/R(50K) ≤ 2 ratios, together with a weak localization behavior just above T C could be attributed to the essential scattering due to the localized electronic states.  The superconducting transitions in a field up to 10 T along c-axis have been measured on a c-axis oriented film grown on SrTiO 3.The zero-temperature in-plane upper critical field B ab C2 (0) is estimated from the resistivity transition data."
