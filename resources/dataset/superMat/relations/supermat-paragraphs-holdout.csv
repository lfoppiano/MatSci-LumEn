0,SST01600L7-CC,2,x = 0.15,38 K,,,"La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) system is known to be one of the cuprate superconductor systems with fewer components and a simple layered structure of K 2 NiF 4 type which can be basically described as a stacking of single-plane CuO 2 superconduct- ing layers separated by two (La, Sr)O layers. The intrinsic Josephson junctions of LSCO have re- cently been characterized as stacked serial SIS junctions , and its high Josephson plasma fre- quency in THz region is quite interesting for de- veloping new electronic devices such as THz gen- erators and detectors .  On the other hand, its electronic states strongly depend on hole-doping which can be achieved with the substitution of Sr 2+ cations for La 3+ ones. At very low doping (x < 0.02), La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 is an antiferromag- netic Mott insulator.  After crossing a spin glass state (0.02 < x < 0.05) , it becomes a super- conductor (0.05 < x < 0.26) and then changes to a normal metal (0.26 < x < 0.6) and fi- nally it behaves as a semiconductor (x > 0.6) .In the superconductor regime, the critical temperature of LSCO reaches its maximum of 38 K at x = 0.15.    The investigation on the doping dependences of low temperature physical proper- ties in both normal and superconducting states is important for acquiring a better understanding of high T C superconductivity and strongly cor- related electron systems.  LSCO system is there- fore not only attractive in its possible applications but also in such fundamental research.For both purposes, high-quality and sizable single crystals are highly demanded, and persistent effort has been made in the crystal growth using differ- ent techniques .Traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ) method is widely accepted as a unique approach to growing such incongru- ent melting oxide superconductor crystals.This crucible-free technique avoids the crystal contam- ination from crucible material that will otherwise interfere with the observation of intrinsic phys- ical properties.The large temperature gradient produced by focused lamp images makes possible good solid-liquid interfaces and a stable molten zone."

3,PHC3200009-CC,1,Bi2Sr2CaCu2O 8+δ,86 K,,,"New results from tunneling spectroscopies on near optimally-doped single crystals of Tl2Ba2CuO6 (Tl-2201) junctions are presented. The superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) tunnel junc- tions are obtained using the point-contact technique with a Au tip. The tunneling conductances reproducibly show a sharp cusp-like subgap, prominent quasiparticle peaks with a consistent asym- metry, and weakly decreasing backgrounds. A rigorous analysis of the SIN tunneling data is per- formed using two different models for the d x 2 −y 2 (d-wave) density of states (DOS). Based on these and earlier results, the tunneling DOS of Tl-2201 have exhibited the most reproducible data that are consistent with a d-wave gap symmetry.  We show that the dip feature at 2∆ that is clearly seen in SIN tunneling data of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O 8+δ is also present in Tl-2201, but at a weaker level. The gap values for crystals with a bulk Tc = 86 K are in the range of 19-25 meV."

7,PHC3200009-CC,7,Tl-2201,91 K,,,"Tl-2201 has a tetragonal crystal structure with a single Cu − O layer per unit cell which is relatively simple when compared to the bilayer and trilayer high-T c superconductors.  However, Tl 2 Ba 2 Ca 2−n Cu 2 O 2n+3 (n=1, 2, and 3) family is very sensitive to thallium and oxygen content which influences the structure and superconducting properties. The optimally-doped compound of Tl-2201 has a T c of approximately 91 K and this value can be reduced to zero on the overdoped side by oxygen annealing. The Tl-2201 single crystals were grown from a flux in an alumina crucible with an alumina lid, sealed to avoid loss of thallium oxide.   Tl 2 O 3 , BaO 2 and CuO powders were mixed at the atomic ratio of Tl:Ba:Cu=2.2:2:2 using excess Tl 2 O 3 and CuO as the flux. The crucibles, containing about 50 g of charge, were loaded in a vertical tube furnace and heated rapidly to 925-950 o C.This temperature was held for 1/2 hour. The furnace was then cooled at 5 o C/h to 875 o C, and finally cooled to room temperature. The crystals were platelet-shaped, with a basal plane area of about 1 mm 2 and a thickness along the c-axis varying between 20-100µm.The critical temperature of the samples is determined by ac magnetization measurements."
8,PHC3200009-CC,11,Tl-2201 crystals,86 K,,,"Figure shows the conductances of eight junctions on three different Tl-2201 crystals, each with a bulk T c near 86 K.  These junctions are representative of a larger set of data and they demonstrate several characteristics that are typical for PCT tunneling in Tl-2201. Each junction exhibits a single energy gap feature with conductance peaks at |V | = 20 − 25 mV.  The voltage is that of the sample respect to the tip and thus negative bias corresponds to removal of electrons from the superconductor.There is a characteristic asymmetry in the conductance peaks such that the negative bias peak is higher than the one at positive bias. This type of asymmetry has also been seen in PCT and STM studies of Bi-2212, most consistently in overdoped samples. It has been pointed out that this conductance peak asymmetry may be a signature of the d-wave pairing.  The background conductances for |eV | > ∆ are generally weakly decreasing with bias similar to that in Bi-2212, and it is these type of junctions that exhibit the largest peak height to background (PHB) ratio. A few junctions show a flat or slightly increasing background with a smaller PHB ratio. This implies that the decreasing background is an intrinsic property of the quasiparticle DOS. While such a feature may be due to the underlying band structure DOS, we note the absence of any van Hove singularity (VHS) in these data as well as earlier PCT data on Tl-2201.All of the junctions exhibit a cusp-like feature at zero bias which is characteristic of a d-wave DOS."

This discrepancy raises an important question in HTS cuprates, namely the relationship between gap size ∆(T = 0) and T c .  The unusual ∆ versus doping in Bi-2212, which violates mean-field theory, strongly suggest that T c is a phase coherence temperature. In this picture, there are strong superconducting fluctuations above T c and presumably the ability of each HTS to support such fluctuations depends on structural parameters, anistropy and the degree of 2-dimensionality.It is thus possible that there is no universal relationship between ∆ and T c for all HTS. If there exists a universal relationship between these two parameters for HTS cuprates as is approximately the case for conventional superconductors, then the difference in the gap size between these two HTS's needs another explanation.  It is possible, due to the strength of the interplane bonding, that the tunneling measurement is probing predominantly the surface of the Tl-2201 crystals which has been exposed to air and may have properties different from the bulk.This raises the possibility that the surface of Tl-2201 may be slightly overdoped, which results in a smaller gap size.

The resistance measurement shown in the inset of confirms the result in an opposite way. The fresh pellet shows no superconducting transi- tion above 1.9 K, however, after the very same sample was placed in humid environment at room temperature over a period of time, superconductivity was recovered.  Moreover, T c increases with increasing the placement time. Therefore, it should be careful to draw any conclusions on the relationship between T c and the factors, such as water and sodium content.We checked the XRD patterns for the as-pressed and the as-placed pellets.  Both data in- dicates single phase of c=19.7Å , however, the as-pressed sample shows very broad diffraction peaks, and the broad peaks change back into sharp ones for the as-placed sample.This observation suggests that the crystallinity, affected by water, be important for the superconductivity."

However, in the cuprates, the real coexistence of magnetic order and superconductiv- ity or a microscopic phase segregation remains a matter of discussion.Especially, the role played by disorder is still an open question .In this letter, we evidence the appearance of antiferromagnetic order in the CuO 2 planes of a fully oxydised superconducting YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 based system with T c =93 K, when a disorder is intro- duced through the substitution of cobalt atoms at the copper site of the chains."

The observed structure factors differ slightly from that for the Cu(2) spins in the undoped state of the cuprates.

Actually, at ambient pres- sure the x parameters of all cubic rare earth and actinide sequicarbides cluster around 0.051 with a quite narrow spread of ±0.002. The arrangement of metal ions in La 2 C 3 is similar to that of the 'cI16' (16-atom body centered cubic) phase of high-pressure Li which can be interpreted as a 2×2×2 su- perstructure of bcc. In Li-cI16 a pseudo-gap is formed, involving a lowering of the density of states N (E F ) at the Fermi level, which leads to a decrease of the total energy relative to any of the common high-symmetry phases of elemental metals. Despite the pseudo-gap formation, the cI16 phase of Li is a superconductor with T c > 10 K (see Ref. and literature cited therein).   As for La 2 C 3 , the Fermi level is calculated to also fall into a local mini- mum of the DOS.This is qualitatively similar to what is reported for Y 2 C 3 . 4,5 It is not clear whether the forma- tion of a local DOS minimum in the sesquicarbides is a consequence of the structural distortion of the metal sub- lattice away from bcc.  In any case, the states in the DOS minimum of Y 2 C 3 show a strong coupling to 'symmetry- preserving' metal atom displacements, i.e. a change in the x parameter.  For La 2 C 3 , a C-C distance of 1.236Å is given in Ref. .

For comparison, the universal OCT relation: S 290K =24.2-139p included in the well-known phenomenological parabolic law: T c /T cmax =1-82.6(p-0.16) 2 is represented as a solid line. The maximal critical temperature is estimated to be T cmax =20 K which is a reasonable value for this one-layer system.  Our data are slightly shifted (∆p∼0.025, dotted line) from the universal behavior, as it was also reported in the case of Bi(La)-2201 single crystals . All points T c vs S 290 can be reasonably fitted with a shifted parabolic line (dotted line), except for the least overdoped sample (p∼0.20), which has lower T c value .Consequently, in the absence of a more accurate determination, an estimation of the hole number p can be made from the OCT law within an estimated error of 10% (values indicated at the top axis).  In the inset of the same figure, we show S 290 values as a function of δ (circles).A linear fit, S 290 =6.82-122δ (dashed line), assuming a linear relation between the hole number p and oxygen excess δ, is used to extrapolate δ values for the two less overdoped samples (pluses)."

Its position becomes closer to the Fermi surface with increasing doping and it is located around 5 meV below the Fermi surface (FS) in the strongly overdoped case of Bi(Pb)-2201 (T c <4 K) . Thus, the saddle point, giving rise to a van Hove singularity (VHS) in the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, emphasizes narrow band properties."

In this work, we mea- sured the reversible magnetization as a function of the temperature and the angle between the c axis and the applied magnetic field. From analysis of the data, we found that the usual HTSC two-dimensional (2D) tem- perature region of ξ c (T ) < c below T c did not exist in this compound. This peculiar feature has not been observed in any other high-T c material.  Until now, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ (Y-123) has been known to have the most strong inter- layer coupling, but the three-dimensional (3D) tempera- ture region is limited to near T c only.Previously, it was claimed that the high-T c superconductivity occurred only on the 2D network of CuO 2 planes, since a 3D net- work did not permit spin or charge fluctuation while a 1D structure did not establish long range order of super- conductivity. Hence, our observation of 3D superconduc- tivity in entire region below T c in Sr(La)-112 provides a new aspect of high-temperature superconductivity."

Similar to the cuprates and heavy fermions, superconductivity in iron arsenides emerges close to the magnetic instability.   There are mainly two classes of Fe-arsenides showing superconductivity.RFeAsO crystallizes in the ZrCuSiAs-type structure, composed by alternating (RO) and FeAs layers.  The other class of compounds belongs to the well known ThCr 2 Si 2 -type structure (so called 122 family), AFe 2 As 2 (A: Ba, Sr, Eu or Ca) composed of FeAs layers separated by A-layers. Superconductivity in these systems is induced by partial hole or electron doping of the FeAs layers, which otherwise order magnetically.  Electron doping has been highly successful for RFeAsO by substitution of oxygen by fluorine or by oxide vacancies, whereas K or Na doping is more successful for AFe 2 As 2 compounds.EuFe 2 As 2 belongs to the so-called 122 family. We have recently performed systematic physical property measurements on EuFe 2 As 2 single crystals and Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 polycrystals .  A very similar magnetic transition related to Fe 2 As 2 layers was revealed in EuFe 2 As 2 and other AFe 2 As 2 systems.  EuFe 2 As 2 undergoes a SDW magnetic transition at 190 K due to Fe ordering, accompanied by a structural transition .  Furthermore it also shows a second magnetic ordering at 19 K due to Eu 2+ spin ordering.By doping Potassium to the Eu lattice (hole doping), Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 shows the suppression of the SDW transition and the appearance of a SC phase transition at 32 K.We have also measured the magnetic penetration depth λ(T ) for polycrystalline samples of Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 , which shows deviations from conventional behavior.A minimum in the penetration depth vs temperature at 4.2 K suggests a strong influence of the Eu magnetic ordering on the supercondusting properties.Additionally, our recent Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements clearly establish the coexistence of Eu short- range magnetic order with superconductivity in Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 samples below 4.5 K."

Between the CuO 2 planes are various kinds of layers, typ- ically NaCl-type, which are insulating and act merely as a charge reservoir.To date, the ruthenate compound Sr 2 RuO 4 is the only known layered perovskite-like sys- tem which becomes superconducting even though it does not contain any CuO 2 planes or CuO chains . Despite its rather low transition temperature T c = 1.5 K the study of its electronic and magnetic properties has become a very rich and active field of research .

A whole new family of hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compounds may therefore be con- structed whose members consist of different sequences of alternating RuO 2 -and CuO 2 layers. Recently, one such a hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compound, the 1212-type RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 system comprising CuO 2 bilayers and RuO 2 monolayers, has been synthesized as single-phase material .   A subsequent study of its electronic and mag- netic properties has revealed that this material exhibits electronic ferromagnetic order at a rather high Curie tem- perature T Curie =133-136 K and becomes superconduct- ing at a significantly lower critical temperature T c =15-40 K (depending on the condition of preparation and anneal- ing) .The most surprising observation, however, is that the ferromagnetic order does not vanish when super- conductivity sets in at T c .  Instead, it appears that the ferromagnetic state remains largely unchanged and coex- ists with superconductivity.  This finding implies that the interaction between the superconducting-and the ferro- magnetic order parameters is very weak and it raises the question of whether both order parameters coexist on a truly microscopic scale.Since the early investigations of Ginzburg in 1957 the prevailing view is that the coexis- tence of a superconducting-(with singlet Cooper pairs) and a ferromagnetic order parameter is not possible on a microscopic scale since the electromagnetic interaction and the exchange coupling cause strong pairbreaking. Indeed, merely based on magnetisation and transport measurements one cannot exclude the possibility that the RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 samples may be spatially inhomoge- neous with some domains exhibiting ferromagnetic order and others superconducting order . We note that unam- biguous evidence for the occurence of bulk superconduc- tivity in RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 has recently been obtained from specific heat measurements which reveal a sizeable jump at T c of ∆γ ≡ C p /T ≈ 0.35 mJ/g at.K 2 characteristic of a strongly underdoped cuprate superconductor .In the following we report on muon-spin rotation (µSR) mea- surements which establish that the ferromagnetic order is uniform and homogeneous even on a microscopic scale."

Fur- thermore, the ZF-µSR data establish that the ferromag- netic order is hardly affected by the onset of superconduc- tivity and persists to the lowest available temperature of the experiment T=2.2 K. The ZF-µSR data can be com- plemented by DC-magnetisation measurements which es- tablish the presence of ferromagnetic order from the ob- servation of a spontaneous magnetization at T Curie = 133 K and of hysteretic isothermal magnetic behavior with a remanent magnetization.  It is shown that the fer- romagnetic ordering involves the Ru magnetic moments with µ(Ru) ≈ 1.05(5) µ B , while the larger Gd-moments with µ(Gd 3+ ) ≈ 7.4(1) µ B remain paramagnetic down to very low temperatures.In addition, the magnetisation measurements indicate an almost complete diamagnetic shielding effect below T c."

As a function of decreasing temperature Λ(T ) can be seen to exhibit a cusp-like feature at the ferromagnetic transition of the Ru-moments at T Curie =133 K and a step-like increase at very low temperature which most likely is related to the ordering of the Gd moments. The cusp feature at T Curie = 133 K characterizes the slowing down of the spin dy- namics of the Ru-moments as the ferromagnetic tran- sition is approached. The cusp maximum occurs when the spin fluctuation rate, τ c , equals the typical µSR time scale for τ c ∼ 10 −611 . Note, that in the ferromagnetically- ordered state the longitudinal relaxation rate remains unusually large with values of Λ(T <<T Curie ) ≈ 0.3- 0.4 µs −1 that are at least an order of magnitude larger than expected for a classical ferromagnet (where two- magnon excitations provide the major contribution to spin dynamics). We have confirmed by a µSR measure- ments in a longitudinal field of H LF =6 kOe that this large relaxation rate is indeed characteristic for the lon- gitudinal component of the µSR signal. At present we cannot provide a definite explanation of the origin of the unusually large value of Λ. However, we emphasize that the RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 system can be expected to ex- hibit a rather complex magnetic behavior since, besides the ferromagnetically-ordered Ru moments, it also con- tains the larger Gd moments with µ(Gd 3+ ) ≈ 7.4 µ B which remain paramagnetic below T Curie . The magnetic ordering transition of the Gd moments at T≈2.6 K is evident in the ZF-µSR data in Fig. from the sudden increase in the local magnetic field (or the µSR precession frequency, ν µ ) and a corresponding increase in both relaxation rates, λ and Λ. In addition, we note that recently it has been shown by µSR measurements that in strongly underdoped high-T c cuprate supercon- ductors (like the present RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8 compound) also the Cu moments exhibit a spin-glass type freezing tran- sition at low temperature .  Finally, it appears that the longitudinal relaxation rate Λ exhibits an additional weak anomaly at a temperature of T≈20 K, i.e. in the vicinity of the superconducting transition at T c =16 K. At present we are not sure whether this effect is related to the onset of superconductivity.   From Fig. it appears that the transverse relaxation rate also exhibits a steplike increase in the same temperature range.The local magnetic field at the muon site, however, (see Fig. ) does not seem to exhibit any anomaly in the vicinity of T c .We ex- pect that further µSR measurements on rare earth (RE) substituted RuSr 2 Gd 1−x RE x Cu 2 O 8 samples, as well as on less strongly underdoped samples with higher critical temperatures of T c up to 40 K, should shed more light on the complex magnetic behavior and its interplay with superconductivity in the Ru-1212 system."

We obtain evidence that superconducting charge carriers originate from the CuO 2 planes, while the ferromagnetic order is associated with the Ru moments with µ(Ru) ≈ 1 µ B .   The larger Gd moments with µ(Gd) ≈ 7.4 µ B do not appear to participate in the ferromagnetic transition but remain paramagnetic to very low temperature and undergo most likely an antiferromagnetic transition at T N =2.6 K.The ZF-µSR experiments provide evidence that the ferromagnetic phase is homogeneous on a mi- croscopic scale and accounts for most of the sample vol- ume. Furthermore, they indicate that the magnetically ordered state is not significantly modified by the onset of superconductivity. This rather surprising result raises the question as to how ferromagnetic and superconduct- ing order can coexist on a microscopic scale while avoid- ing strong pairbreaking effects that tend to destroy su- perconductivity.We have outlined a possible scenario which relies on the two-dimensional charge dynamics of the CuO 2 planes and the assumption that the ferromag- netic order parameter of the Ru-moments is confined to the RuO 2 layers."

In particular, Noda et al. have suggested in La 1.4−x Nd 0.6 Sr x CuO 4 that the rapid decrease in R H below T d2 is a typical behavior of the one-dimensional transport associated with the formation of the stripe or- der. Therefore, it is much convinced that the static stripe order of holes and spins is formed at low temper- atures below T d2 also in La 2−x Ba x CuO 4 with x = 0.11, though it has already been predicted from the experi- mental results in the polycrystalline samples.

In par- ticular, Millis and Monien attribute the pseudogap (or the spin gap) to strong antiferromagnetic correlations be- tween the planes in the bilayer, which are responsible for a quantum order-disorder transition. Apart from having only one CuO 2 layer La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) is also a good model system for the study of doping dependences since it can be doped by the addition of strontium over a wide range: from the underdoped, where T c increases with Sr content, to the optimally doped where T c reaches its maximum value of ≈ 40 K at x = 0.17, and to the overdoped region where T c → 0 at x = 0.34.     The characteristic signatures of the pseudogap state in the dc resistivity are seen clearly in LSCO . These are the striking deviations below a temperature T * from the high temperature linear resistivity, resulting in a clear break in slope at T * .It was found by B. Batlogg et al. that in LSCO T * decreases from 800 K to ap- proximately 300 K as the doping level is increased from the strongly underdoped to just over the optimal doping level.Similar behavior at T = T * has been observed in the Hall effect coefficient and the magnetic susceptibility. The pseudogap can also be observed if the conductiv- ity is measured in the frequency domain, σ(ω), where it shows up as a striking depression of the frequency depen- dent scattering rate at low frequency.   It is found that below a frequency Ω p ≈ 600 cm −1 , the scattering rate drops below its high temperature, high frequency, linear behavior.  This effect has been clearly identified in the bilayer materials.One of the aims of this paper is to see if this behavior can also be observed in LSCO.A pseudogap state can be defined in terms of this suppres- sion of scattering: the material is in the pseudogap state when the scattering rate falls below the high frequency straight-line extrapolation.In the low frequency limit the scattering rate is proportional to the dc resistivity.Due to this, the 1/τ (ω,T) suppression should be com- pared to the suppression of ρ DC (T) at temperatures below the linear T dependence region.The IR measure- ment gives us the possibility to see both the frequency and the temperature dependence of this feature."

Apart from having only one CuO 2 layer La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) is also a good model system for the study of doping dependences since it can be doped by the addition of strontium over a wide range: from the underdoped, where T c increases with Sr content, to the optimally doped where T c reaches its maximum value of ≈ 40 K at x = 0.17, and to the overdoped region where T c → 0 at x = 0.34.     The characteristic signatures of the pseudogap state in the dc resistivity are seen clearly in LSCO . These are the striking deviations below a temperature T * from the high temperature linear resistivity, resulting in a clear break in slope at T * .It was found by B. Batlogg et al. that in LSCO T * decreases from 800 K to ap- proximately 300 K as the doping level is increased from the strongly underdoped to just over the optimal doping level.Similar behavior at T = T * has been observed in the Hall effect coefficient and the magnetic susceptibility. The pseudogap can also be observed if the conductiv- ity is measured in the frequency domain, σ(ω), where it shows up as a striking depression of the frequency depen- dent scattering rate at low frequency.   It is found that below a frequency Ω p ≈ 600 cm −1 , the scattering rate drops below its high temperature, high frequency, linear behavior.  This effect has been clearly identified in the bilayer materials.One of the aims of this paper is to see if this behavior can also be observed in LSCO.A pseudogap state can be defined in terms of this suppres- sion of scattering: the material is in the pseudogap state when the scattering rate falls below the high frequency straight-line extrapolation.In the low frequency limit the scattering rate is proportional to the dc resistivity.Due to this, the 1/τ (ω,T) suppression should be com- pared to the suppression of ρ DC (T) at temperatures below the linear T dependence region.The IR measure- ment gives us the possibility to see both the frequency and the temperature dependence of this feature."

A much clearer picture of the pseudogap state can be seen from the effective scattering rate, 1/τ (ω,T), cal- culated from the conductivity using equation (1) which is shown along with the effective mass in Fig. and Fig. . The 1/τ (ω,T) spectra can conveniently be divided into two regions. In the high frequency region, starting at about 700 cm −1 , the scattering rate varies linearly with frequency while in the low frequency region there is a clear suppression of 1/τ (ω,T) below this linear trend. The temperature where this suppression first appears serves as a definition of T * , the onset temperature of the pseudogap state.  As the temperature is lowered below T * this suppression becomes deeper.We find that for under- doped La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 T * ≥ 400 K, an order of magnitude higher than the superconducting transition temperature T c (32 K). This is significantly different from previous results on cuprates where T * more or less coincides with T c near optimal doping."

For example, the observation of the T -linear resistivity from 10 K to 700 K in Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6 (Bi-2201) had a strong impact, because it clearly demonstrated the dominance of the electron-electron interaction in the scattering mecha- nism. In high-T c cuprates, it has been discussed that the charge transport is governed by two different scattering times with different temperature dependences ; ac- cording to this ""two-scattering-time"" model, in-plane re- sistivity ρ ab is governed by the transport scattering time τ tr (∼T −1 ) and the Hall angle θ H is governed by the ""Hall scattering time"" τ H (∼T −2 ).  However, this idea of ""scattering-time separation"" has not yet gained a com- plete consensus and there are other approaches to un- derstand the unusual normal-state transport properties . Therefore, it would be useful to establish the tem- perature and doping range in which the T 2 behavior of the Hall scattering rate τ −1 H is observed. There are two widely-known cuprate systems which satisfy the requirements of the relatively low T c and the availability of a wide doping range; La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 (LSCO) system and Bi-2201 system. Bi-2201 has not been as intensively studied as LSCO, mostly because of the difficulty in obtaining high-quality single crystals.   A number of problems have been known for Bi-2201 crys- tals: (a) the transport properties of B-2201 are quite non-reproducible even among crystals of nominally the same composition ; (b) the residual resistivity of the in-plane resistivity ρ ab is usually large (the smallest value reported to date is 70 µΩcm ), as opposed to LSCO, YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO), or Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 (Bi- 2212), where the residual resistivity in high-quality crys- tals is negligibly small; and (c) the temperature de- pendence of the Hall coefficient is weak and thus the Hall angle θ H does not obey the T 2 law , while θ H ∼ T 2 has been almost universally observed in other cuprates .On the other hand, the Bi-2201 system has very attractive characteristics: it has been known for Bi-2201 that the carrier concentration can be widely changed by partially replacing Sr with La (to under- dope) or Bi with Pb (to overdope) ; at optimum dop- ing (Bi 2 Sr 2−x La x CuO 6 with x≃0.4), the maximum T c is about 30 K , which is lower than the maximum T c of LSCO.Therefore, if single crystals of sufficiently high quality are grown, this system would present an ideal stage for the systematic study of the normal-state prop- erties down to lower temperatures than in other cuprates."

The small cusp at 42 K is likely due to a Co 3 O 4 impurity phase, which is known to have an antiferromagnetic transition in the 33 to 46 K range. By comparing the size the magne- tization cusp with that for bulk Co 3 O 4 , we estimate that the Co 3 O 4 impurity fraction of our sample is small, at the 1% level.However, we cannot detect the existence of Co 3 O 4 within our x-ray diffraction sensitivity.    Apart from this anomaly and the low temperature Curie tail (which arises from only 0.5% of the Co moments), the susceptibility is nearly temperature independent. Note the large magnitude and strong anisotropy.For compar- ison, the magnitude is about 5 times that of lanthanum strontium cuprate (La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 ) and 30 times that of a simple metal like Na. The anisotropy is probably due to a combination of anisotropy in the g factor and the van Vleck term.AC susceptibility measurements were taken in a field of 3 Gauss/100 Hz as shown in the inset of .The diamagnetic signal is indicative of a su- perconducting phase with an onset temperature of about 4.2 K, and the screening fraction is estimated to be about 120% (without geometric correction)."
138,L092157004-CC,8,,4.2 K,,specific heat,"The specific heat of an array of co-aligned single crys-tals (combined mass of 4.7 mg) was measured using a Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum De- sign) in applied magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 14 T and temperatures ranging from 0.37 K to 10 K as shown in . The sample had been hydrated for three months after electrochemical de-intercalation, and x-ray diffraction indicates that 94% of the sample consists of the fully hydrated superconducting structure. In zero field, a pronounced peak is observed at 4.2 K, indicating the transition to bulk superconductivity.  A second broad peak exists at lower temperature around 1.5 K. In a field of 1 T, the superconducting anomaly at 4.2 K is strongly suppressed; in contrast, the peak at 1.5 K is slightly en- hanced. This suggests that the peak around 1.5 K is not related to a second superconducting phase with a lower T c. Such a peak may be compatible with a model of weakly interacting localized Co moments, analogous to the effects seen in impurity-doped semiconductors.  In fields larger than 5 T, both peaks disappear and are re- placed by a broad enhancement of C/T over a wide range of temperatures.With increasing field, the enhancement of C/T shifts to higher temperatures. In the inset of , the top panel compares the sup- pression of the superconducting anomaly for H c and H ab. In order to achieve a comparable suppression, an in-plane field with magnitude 5 times that of the the out-of-plane field is required. This reflects the anisotropy of H c2 in the different field orientations and is consistent with our resistivity measurements of H c2 (discussed be- low). We note that ∆C/T c in zero-field for our single crystal sample is comparable to that reported by other groups in powder samples.   The data plotted in the main part of exhibit an upturn at the lowest measured temperatures which increases with increasing field. This is most likely due to a Schottky contribution from the nuclear spins. The bottom panel of the inset shows C/T data at high-fields in which a nuclear Schot- tky contribution (6.7×10 −6 B 2 /T 2 ) has been subtracted. These data demonstrate that in fields greater than ∼10 T superconductivity is completely suppressed.Hence, 10 T may be taken as an upper limit for H c2 with H ab."
