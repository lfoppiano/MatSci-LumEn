The exciting discovery of the split superconductive transitions in UPt 3 at T c1 = 530 mK and T c2 = 480 mK in specific heat measurements has led to an enormous amount of experimental and theoretical work on UPt 3 .     The additional small moment antiferromagnetism observed in UPt 3 (T N = 5.8 K, \u00b5 = 0.035 \u00b5 B ) plays a key role in the identification of the SC order parameter since the in-plane staggered magnetization acts as a symmetry breaking field (SBF) to the SC multicomponent order parameter. The SBF is believed to be responsible for the appearance of two SC transitions which otherwise would merge into one.Therefore one can identify three distinct SC phases. Despite the wealth of experimental results on UPt 3 there is no unequivocal consensus on the symmetry and node structure of the SC gap.UPd 2 Al 3 (see ) is a rather special case among the U-based HF superconductors.

They result from the dominating 5f 2 configuration of the U 4+ ion .This dual nature of 5f-electrons is even more obvious than in UPt 3 as is seen in various experiments. A direct confirmation of this dual nature of 5f-electrons in UPd 2 Al 3 was obtained from inelastic neutron scattering (INS) which found excitations that originate from local CEF transitions and disperse into bands of \"magnetic excitons\" due to intersite exchange.Complementary tunneling experiments with epitaxial UPd 2 Al 3 -AlO x -Pb heterostructures probed the response of the itinerant quasiparticles and their SC gap.Strong coupling features in the tunneling density of states were reported suggesting that the magnetic excitons identified in INS are the bosonic \"glue\" which binds the electrons to Cooper pairs .This new mechanism for superconductivity is distinctly different from both the electron-phonon and spin fluctuation mechanism known so far.The pairing potential is mediated by a propagating boson (the magnetic exciton) as in the former case but depends on the spin state of conduction electrons as in the latter case.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"UPt 3\", \"UPt 3\", \"UPt 3\", \"UPd 2 Al 3\"], \"tcs\": [\"less than 1 K\", \"530 mK\", \"480 mK\", \"1.8 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"specific heat\", \"specific heat\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: UPt 3, tc: less than 1 K\n  - material: UPt 3, tc: 530 mK, me_methods: specific heat\n  - material: UPt 3, tc: 480 mK, me_methods: specific heat\n  - material: UPd 2 Al 3, tc: 1.8 K\n"}]}

The discovery of unconventional superconductivity under pressure in the itinerant ferromagnets UGe 2 and later for URhGe and the 3d ferromagnet ZrZn 2 (more recent investigations showed that here only a surface layer probably with higher Zr content becomes SC ) under ambient pressure has opened this theoretical scenario to experimental investigation.

In addition, the compound becomes a nodal superconductor below T c = 1.2 K .   The simple tetragonal AF order with wave vector in c-direction has tiny moments \u00b5 ~ 0.02 \u00b5 B along c-axis which are of the same order as in UPt 3 .However, unlike in UPt 3 , very large thermodynamic effects, e. g., in specific heat, thermal expansion etc., occur which are hard to reconcile with the small ordered moments. These pronounced anomalies were interpreted as evidence for the presence of a second \"hidden order\" parameter, which cannot be seen in neutron or x-ray diffraction. In the itinerant models the order parameter is due to an unconventional pairing in the particle-hole channel leading to an unconventional SDW which has vanishing moment in the clean limit and also does not break time reversal invariance.   The small staggered moments may then be induced in the condensate due to impurity scattering.Finally, in the dual models one assumes a localized singlet-singlet system in interaction with the itinerant electrons to cause induced moment magnetism with small moments but large anomalies.In all models it was previously taken for granted that both the primary \"hidden\" order parameter and AF order coexist homogeneously within the sample.However, hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure experiments have radically changed this view, showing that the order parameters exist in different parts of the\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"URu 2 Si 2\"], \"tcs\": [\"1.2 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: URu 2 Si 2, tc: 1.2 K\n"}]}

They investigated the pressure effects on the resistivity \u03c1 of the optimally electron- doped (with an x where dT c /dx ~ 0) and the electron-underdoped (in a region where dT c /dx < 0) La(O 1-x F x )FeAs with x = 0.11 and 0.05. Their ambient onset T c 's are 28 K and 9 K for the x = 0.11 and 0.05 samples, respectively. The pressure was generated in a BeCu piston-cylinder cell up to 3 GPa hydrostatically and up to 30 GPa in a diamond anvil cell quasi-hydrostatically.   The \u03c1(T)'s of the x = 0.11 and 0.05 samples are shown in Figs. 5a and b at different pressures. The onset-T c of the x = 0.11 sample, as defined in Fig. 5a, increases steeply from 28 K to 43 K with pressure up to 3 GPa at a large initial rate dT c /dP ~ + 8 K/GPa and then drops off slowly to 9 K at 30 GPa at a rate dT c /dP ~ -1.4 K/GPa as shown in Fig. 6.The onset-T c of the sample of x = 0.05 was also found to increase with pressure but at a slower rate of + 2.0 K/GPa below 3 GPa where the experiment stops (Fig. 7 and inset).

[22] measured the T o and T c of undoped LOFeAs and found that both coexist in a wide range of pressures of ~ 1 -13 GPa.From the above reports, it is clear that the pressure effect on the T c of R1111 depends on R, the pressure hydrostaticity, and the doping level.The effect of pressure hydrostaticity above 2-3 GPa cannot be neglected and the uncertainty associated with the latter is large due to the complexity in sample preparation and characterization.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"x = 0.11 and 0.14\", \"x = 0.05 and 0\", \"LaOFeP\", \"x = 0.05 and 0\", \"LaOFeP\", \"LaOFeP\"], \"tcs\": [\"7 K\", \"20 K\", \"5.8 K\", \"43 K\", \"29 K\", \"8.8 K\"], \"pressures\": [\"1 GPa\"], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: x = 0.11 and 0.14, tc: 43 K\n  - material: x = 0.05 and 0, tc: 29 K\n  - material: x = 0.05 and 0, tc: 20 K\n  - material: LaOFeP, tc: 5.8 K\n  - material: LaOFeP, tc: 8.8 K, pressure: 1 GPa\n  - material: LaOFeP, tc: 7 K\n"}]}

They become superconducting and form a new homologous series of 122 when hole doped, i.e. by partial replacement of Ae with alkaline elements = A, (Ae 1-x A x )Fe 2 As 2 [9, 10, 25, 28].  The large solubility range of (Sr 1-x K x )Fe 2 As 2 makes it possible to form a complete T c -x phase diagram at ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 12 where T o represents the SDW transition temperature. The maximum T c = 38 K takes place at x ~ 0.4 -0.5.    Possible coexistence of SDW and the superconducting states is apparent between x ~ 0.2 and 0.3.The phase diagram makes possible the systematic study of the x-dependence of the pressure coefficient of T c of the 122 series. It should be noted that this was the first complete T c (x)-phase diagram of Fe-pnictides available at the time.We have, therefore, measured \u03c1(T) and \u03c7 ac (T) under hydrostatic pressures up to 1.7 GPa, for different x's to cover the three major regions of hole-doping [10, 15, 29].  The T c (P) for samples with x = 0.2 (underdoped), 0.4 (~ optimally-doped) and 0.7 (overdoped) are given in Fig. 13.   It is unambiguously shown that dT c /dP is positive for the underdoped sample, close to zero for the optimally doped sample and negative for the overdoped sample, in agreement with the prediction of the universal T c (x)- relation proposed for the hole-doped cuprate HTSs as discussed in section 2.1.The observation can be summarized as: dT c /dP > 0 in the region where dT c /dx > 0; dT c /dP ~ 0 where dT c /dx ~ 0; and dT c /dP < 0 where dT c /dx < 0, suggesting that pressure promotes holes.The pressure study on electron-doped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs suggests that pressure generates electrons.Based on these two studies, one may conclude that symmetry between the electron-and hole-dopings exists in Fe- pnictide superconductors, in agreement with the earlier observation by Wen et al. .It should be noted that pressure suppresses the SDW transition in the hole-doped (Sr 1-x K x )Fe 2 As 2 ), just as in the electron-doped Sm(O 1-x F x )FeAs.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"x ~ 0.4 -0.5\"], \"tcs\": [\"38 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: x ~ 0.4 -0.5, tc: 38 K\n"}]}

As can be seen in Fig. , c p varies smoothly across T \u03c1 c while exhibits a sharp jump at \u223c1.6 K. With increasing field, the specific heat jump shifts towards lower temperature and becomes broadened, consistent with a superconducting transition. At 500 Oe, the anomaly is almost suppressed, and the data can be analyzed by the Debye model c p /T = \u03b3 n + \u03b2 3 T 2 + \u03b2 5 T 4 , where \u03b3 n and \u03b2 i (i = 3, 5) are the electronic and phonon specific- heat coefficients, respectively.  The best fit to the data below 3 K yields \u03b3 n = 2.29 mJ mol \u22121 K \u22122 , \u03b2 3 = 0.43 mJ mol \u22121 K \u22124 , and \u03b2 5 = 0.009 mJ mol \u22121 K \u22126 .Once \u03b2 3 is known, the Debye temperature \u0398 D can be calculated using the equation \u0398 D = (12\u03c0 4 NR/5\u03b2 3 ) 1 , where N = 2 and R is the molar gas constant 8.314 J/mol K. This gives \u0398 D = 208 K for SnSb. On the other hand, as shown in the inset of Fig. , the c p value exceeds the Dulong-Petit limit of 3NR = 49.88 J/mol K at temperatures above 200 K, suggesting that all the phonons are excited in this temperature range. Hence one may estimate \u0398 D \u223c 200 K, in good agreement with the above calculation.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"SnSb\"], \"tcs\": [\"\\u223c1.6 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: SnSb, tc: \u223c1.6 K\n"}]}

As a result, an intriguing phase competition between the stripe phase and the superconducting phase appears around a critical composition of x = 0.16 which appears as a bicritical point.

Shortly, many break-junctions were prepared by gluing a sample with epoxy on a flexible insulating substrate and then were broken by bending the substrate with a differential screw at 14 -18 K in a helium atmosphere. The electrical contacts were made by attaching gold wires to a crystal with silver paint. The sample resistance (with the contacts), R sample , at room temperature varied from 5 \u2126 to about 1 k\u2126, depending on the sample. The I(V) and dI/dV(V) tunneling characteristics were determined by the four-terminal method using a standard lock-in modulation technique.

All curves, except the last one, show a gaplike structure.In the absence of generally accepted model for the pseudogap, we consider the presence of the gap-like features in tunneling spectra as a sign of the pseudogap (for more details, see Ref. ). There is no sign indicating at what temperature the superconducting gap was closed. Across T c , the superconducting tunneling spectra evolve continuously into a normal- state quasiparticle-gap structure which vanishes at 232 K < T * < 290 K but remains almost unchanged with temperature up to 232 K . Such evolution of superconducting spectra into normal-state spectra across T c has been also observed in superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) junctions .

This contribution can be explained by the disappearance of the CDW or/and SDW order(s), or incoherent Cooper pairs. From the common sense, the CDW or SDW order is likely to be appear above T c and not to disappear. Consequently, it is most likely that this contribution to the pseudogap is made by preformed pairs . Tunneling spectroscopy is sensitive exclusively to the magnitude of the order parameter. Thus, if the humps originate from the presence of preformed pairs, then the magnitude of the gap-like structure reflects the average value of binding energy per particle . However, our results alone cannot prove that this contribution originates from preformed pairs. We can argue that high-frequency conductivity measurements showed that the incoherent Copper pairs remain well above T c in Bi2212, and it was predicted by the theory .  It is also in agreement with a MCS (Magnetic Coupling between Stripes) model proposed very recently . There is also an alternative explanation for the presence of this contribution to the pseudogap, it is possible that this contribution originates from the presence of the Bi2223 phase with T c = 110 K.

In optimally doped La(O 1\u2212x F x )FeAs T c decreases linearly with increasing pressure up to 30 GPa. This decrease is accompanied by the lattice properties becoming less anisotropic. The close connection between structural properties and su- perconductivity is further shown in ReFeAsO 1\u2212x (Re = rare-earth metal).  Here, T c attains its maximum value where the [FeAs 4 ] units form a regular tetrahedron.In Ba(Fe 0.92 Co 0.08 ) 2 As 2 (\"122\" type) the uniaxial pres- sure dependencies of T c are highly anisotropic and quite pronounced.  T c is anticipated to increase with increas- ing c/a ratio.  Superconductivity was reported in the \"111\"-type ma- terials LiFeAs and NaFeAs. In contrast to the \"1111\" and \"122\" compounds and to the isostructural NaFeAs no signature of a spin-density-wave (SDW) or structural transition has been observed in LiFeAs re- gardless of having a similar charge density in the FeAs layers. Recently, Deng et al. discovered superconduc- tivity below 6 K in the As free \"111\" compound LiFeP, which is isostructural and isoelectronic to LiFeAs and can be considered as compressed LiFeAs.The occurrence of bulk superconductivity in both stoichiometric LiFeAs and LiFeP makes them special among the iron-pnictide materials.   So far bulk superconductivity in a stoichio- metric member of the iron-arsenides and its isostructural phosphorous homolog has not been reported to the best of our knowledge.External pressure and isoelectronic chemical substitution have a different effect on the crys- tal structure.This allows for a detailed study of the influence of structural properties on superconductivity.In this paper we study the effect of hydrostatic pres- sure on LiFeP by electrical-resistivity (\u03c1) and magnetic- susceptibility (\u03c7 AC ) experiments.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"As free \\\"111\\\" compound LiFeP\"], \"tcs\": [\"below 6 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: As free \"111\" compound LiFeP, tc: below 6 K\n"}]}

Recently, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed the existence of a mixed phase where type-I and type-II behaviours coexist. Here, based on our temperature and magnetic field dependent STS experiments on Cu-intercalated PdTe2 we show that as the critical temperature of the superconducting phase goes up from 1.7 K to 2.4 K on Cu-intercalation, the mixed phase disappears and the system be- comes homogeneously type-II.

How- ever, some of these experiments found evidence of type I behaviour as far as the magnetic properties of the su- perconducting phase of PdTe 2 are concerned .These contradicted with certain other experiments where the magnetic properties were found to be consistent with type II superconductivity .  More recently, magnetic field dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy exper- iments revealed coexistence of type I and type II do- mains in PdTe 2 where such an inhomogeneity of the su- perconducting phase was attributed to electronic inho- mogeneities observed in the normal state of PdTe 2 . It turned out that the electronic inhomogeneity could alter the local electron density and the local coherence length thereby leading to a distribution of the Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gorkov (GLAG) parameter (\u03ba) over the surface of PdTe 2 .  Within this picture, it should be possible to disorder the system so that inter-domain scattering of the quasiparticles can average out the \u03ba dis- tribution and make the system homogeneous.In this pa- per, we report the observation of such averaging effect in Cu-PdTe 2 by magnetic field dependent scanning tun- neling spectroscopy experiments.The superconducting phase becomes homogeneously type II while the critical temperature gets enhanced at randomly distributed do- mains on the surface due to random distribution of the intercalates .\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"PdTe 2\"], \"tcs\": [\"below 1.7 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: PdTe 2, tc: below 1.7 K\n"}]}

For clean superconductor the temperature dependence of \u03bb \u22122 can be described in the following way : where F = (1 + exp(E/k B T ) \u22121 is the Fermi function, \u2206(T ) = \u2206 0 \u2022\u2206(T /T c ) represents the temperature de- pendence of the energy gap, and \u2206 0 is the zero tem- perature value of the superconducting gap.\u2206(T /T c ) is the normalized gap taken from Ref. . The best fit to the data using Eq. gives T c = 6.09(2) K, \u03bb \u22122 (0) = 47.4(2) nm, and \u2206 0 = 1.251(9) meV.  The ra- tio 2\u2206 0 /k B T c = 4.77(4) is found, suggesting that ZrB 12 is a strong coupled BCS superconductor. Note, that a rather close value 2\u2206 0 /k B T c \u2243 4.8 has been obtained in point-contact spectroscopy and tunnelling ex- periments. From the other hand a smaller value \u22433.7 has been reported by Lortz et al. using the heat- capacitance technique, thus suggesting a weak coupling strength. This difference has been already pointed out by Tsindlekht et al. . It was explained by enhanced surface characteristics of the ZrB 12 leading to rather dif- ferent superconducting properties of bulk and surface .  Our measurements were performed in the Meissner state, with the field penetrating on a dis- tance \u03bb from the surface and, therefore, give a value of the superconducting gap consistent with those one reported in the surface sensitive experiments .To estimate the uncertainty in the absolute value of \u03bb(0) we used a procedure similar to that one described in Refs. . The temperature dependence of \u03bb(T ) was calculated for N (R) + N (R) and N (R) \u2212 N (R) distributions. The fit of the resulting \u03bb(T ) curves with the power law as well as with the BCS model gives \u03bb(0) in the range from 110 to 170 nm. shows the pressure dependence of \u03bb \u22122 (0) obtained by fitting the reconstructed \u03bb(T ) data at dif- ferent pressures with the BCS model [Eq. ]. In these experiments we studied relative effects measured on the same sample in the same pressure cell. The main system- atic error of these measurements comes from misalign- ments of the experimental setup occurring when the cell is removed from the SQUID magnetometer, to change the pressure, and put back again. This procedure was checked with a set of measurements at constant pressure. The systematic scattering of the magnetization data is about 0.3%, giving a relative error in \u03bb \u22122 (T ) of about 3%. The reducing of the grain size with pressure was taken into account in \u03bb(T ) calculation [Eq. (4)], by using the bulk modulus reported above. The linear fit yields \u03bb \u22122 (0) = 48.4(7)+ 0.29p implying that \u03bb \u22122 increases under pressure with d ln \u03bb \u22122 (0)/dp = 0.60(23)%/kbar [see ].\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"ZrB 12\"], \"tcs\": [\"6.09(2) K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: ZrB 12, tc: 6.09(2) K\n"}]}

The resulting \u03bc 0 H c2 (0) for WB 4.2 is therefore most likely somewhere between the linear extrapolation to 0 K (0.71 T) and that predicted by the WHH model (0.47 T).Taking \u03bc 0 H c2 (0)\uf0a0=\uf0a00.71 T as the upper limit, the approximate coherence length can be calculated by using the Ginzburg-Landau formula \u03be GL (0)\uf0a0=\uf0a0{f 0 /[2\u03c0H c2 (0)]} 1/2 , where f 0 \uf0a0=\uf0a0h/2e and is found to be \u03be GL (0)\uf0a0=\uf0a026 nm.All physical parameters for WB 4.2 are gathered in table 3.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"WB 4.2\"], \"tcs\": [\"2.05 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: WB 4.2, tc: 2.05 K\n"}]}

The inset shows the diamagnetic transition at around 27.4 K de- termined by the crossing point of the extrapolating line of the most steep part with the normal state background M = 0.  In low temperature region the curves are rather linear showing that the major part is due to phonon contribu- tion C ph = \u03b2T 3 + \u03b4T 5 .It is known that the phonon part is independent on the magnetic field, this allows to remove the phonon contribution by subtracting the C/T at a certain field with that at zero field. The results af- ter the substraction are shown in . The subtracted values \u2206\u03b3 = \u03b3(H) \u2212 \u03b3(0) = [C(T, H) \u2212 C(T, H = 0)]/T exhibit a rather linear T dependence in low temperature region. One can also see that the negative slope is actu- ally field dependent. In the following we will show that the field dependent slope of the linear part in low tem- perature region shown in directly deviates from the Simon-Lee 18 scaling law. According to Simon-Lee scaling law C vol /T \u221a H = f (T / \u221a H), in low temperature region, the Volovik's rela- tion restores, thus one has C vol /T = A \u221a H and further has This clearly shows that there is a negative slope for \u2206\u03b3 vs. T , but the slope \u03b1 is a constant. However, from one can see that the slope changes slightly with the magnetic field H. This indicates that only the Volovik's relation is not enough to interpret the data.

Although strongly correlated systems are beyond the scope of the Kohn-Sham scheme of the DFT, many successful attempts have been made to deal with the description of superconducting materials. In particular, some specific properties of the normal state, e.g. electronic band dispersions and electronic density of states, are very useful to elucidate aspects of the superconducting mechanism and to predict relevant parameters, such as the critical temperature T c and the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb. In the last few years, an increasing number of studies appeared using this methodology, either as support for experimental discoveries or fully theoretical investigations . Superconductivity was recently experimentally reported, by some of the present authors, for the HfV 2 Ga 4 compound, with a critical temperature (T c ) of 4.1 K .   The investi- gators observed some deviations from the more conventional BCS theory signatures, such as an unusual inflection near T c in lower and upper critical field as a function of reduced temperature, and a second jump in the specific heat vs. temperature curve. The authors speculated that the experimental results could be either due to sample inhomogeneity or to the presence of more than one superconducting gap at the Fermi surface, resulting in a two-band superconductivity .These recent experimental results for the bulk HfV 2 Ga 4 point to a new promising class of materials to study unconventional superconducting behavior.   Motivated by these results, here we perform ab-initio electronic structure calculations for HfV 2 Ga 4 .We focus our atten- tion on the analysis of the possible mechanisms behind the superconducting properties.The theoretical study was extended to a new (possibly) bulk superconducting compound with the same prototype structure, ScV 2 Ga 4 , as a way to manipulate the electronic structure aiming at enhancing the superconducting transition temperature.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"HfV 2 Ga 4\"], \"tcs\": [\"4.1 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: HfV 2 Ga 4, tc: 4.1 K\n"}]}

Such H-dependence is most likely caused by a de- crease in the characteristic magnetic-field scale to sup- press superconducting fluctuations, and some vortex fluc- tuations in the pseudogap state are possibly in- volved in this anomaly.In any case, when this anomalous H-dependence is observed near T c , the MR data cannot be discussed on the same ground as those at higher tem- peratures, and therefore we do not include the MR data for temperatures very close to T c in the discussions after- wards.

The data show that the material is a bulk superconductor, with superconducting characteristics similar to that of the double-layer cobaltate. In the three-layer system, however, we reproducibly observed a dependence of the superconducting properties on length of hydration time. Figure shows characteristic data illustrating this effect.  In this set of experiments, anhydrous sodium cobaltate of nominal composition Na 0.3 CoO 2 , obtained in a 40X reaction with bromine, was placed in a hydration chamber where the hydration process is accomplished at ambient temperature on exposure to an atmosphere of 100% relative humidity.A small portion of the sample was removed in daily intervals for testing. The figure shows that the initial T c is in the range of 3K. The T c then increases to the optimal value, where it is stable for several days.  Tc then degrades on further storage in the hydration atmosphere.  Powder X-ray diffraction characterization of the material indicated that the three-layer Na 0.30 CoO 2 \u20221.3H 2 O superconducting phase is present and single-phase to our experimental sensitivity for the duration of these experiments.Therefore the chemical changes that are taking place to yield the observations in figure do not involve decomposition of the superconducting phase but rather subtle structural or chemical changes.  One possibility is that some Na may be leached out of the superconductor into the surrounding intergrain water over a period of several days 6 , 7 an effect that is accelerated for hydration by immersion in large volumes of liquid water. The observed change in Tc may therefore represent the leaching of a slightly Na rich composition through the optimal composition to a Na poor composition over a period of a week, tracing out the narrow peak in Tc vs.Na content .The lower chemical stability of the three- layer superhydrate at ambient conditions may be what allows this effect to be observed on a short laboratory time scale, but the general similarity of the chemistry of the phases suggests that this is may occur to a smaller degree in the two-layer superconductor as well.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"three-layer Na 0.30 CoO 2 \\u20221.3H 2 O\"], \"tcs\": [\"range of 3K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: three-layer Na 0.30 CoO 2 \u20221.3H 2 O, tc: range of 3K\n"}]}
