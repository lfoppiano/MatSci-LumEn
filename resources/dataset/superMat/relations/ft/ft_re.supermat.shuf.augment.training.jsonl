While measured under \"zero field\", there still exists a remanent field of \u223c 1 Oe. The precisions of ac magnetic suscep- tibility (\u03c7 ac ) and dc susceptibility (\u03c7 dc ) are better than \u223c 10 \u22127 emu and \u223c 10 \u22125 emu, respectively.  The electri- cal resistivity (\u03c1) was measured in a standard four-probe configuration using a pressed sample bar. The heat ca- pacity was measured using an automated relaxation tech- nique with a square piece of \u223c 20 mg sample. The con- tribution from the addenda has been subtracted.  It is noted that the handling of the sample and the detailed measurement procedure sometimes affect the experimen- tal result very much.So, we kept the same experimental condition for the different measurements.

The real part of ac suscep- tibility \u03c7 \u2032 shows the onset of diamagnetism at 4.3 K, followed by a broad superconducting transition, similar to the original report .  The diamagnetic screening sig- nal at 1.9 K is 9.2 % of the full shielding when the ac field amplitude (H ac ) is 2 Oe, suggesting relatively low superconducting fraction.   Considering that the \u03c7 \u2032 value is not flat down to 1.9 K, the superconducting volume fraction will be over 10 % under the remanent field of \u223c 1 Oe.The imaginary component of the ac susceptibil- ity shows an incomplete dissipation peak, also suggesting that the superconducting transition is not finished yet at 1.9 K.The dc susceptibility under 30 Oe shows even low magnetic exclusion, which is primarily due to the very low H c1 value as well as the magnetic penetration (see the result below).An irreversible temperature can be noticed, like that observed in the high T c cuprates.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Na 0.31 CoO 2 \\u20221.3H 2 O\"], \"tcs\": [\"4.3 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"suscep- tibility\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Na 0.31 CoO 2 \u20221.3H 2 O, tc: 4.3 K, me_methods: suscep- tibility\n"}]}

On the other hand, \u03bb ep can be calculated to be 0.57 using the formula where Coulomb repulsion parameter \u00b5 * is assumed to be 0.13 empirically .Therefore, N (0) is derived to be 4.3 states/eV\u2022f.u. We note that this value is almost identical to the band calculation result (4.4 states/eV\u2022Co) for the parent compound Na 0.5 CoO 2 . It is noted that the sample's magnetic susceptibility (\u223c 2.0\u00d710 \u22123 emu/mol-f.u) is almost temperature indepen- dent from 30 K to 300 K (not shown here).  In order to obtain the Pauli susceptibility \u03c7 P auli , the \u03c7(T ) data were fitted using the equation \u03c7 = \u03c7 0 + AT 2 + C/(T \u2212 \u03b8) . We obtained that \u03c7 0 , A, C and \u03b8 are 0.0019 emu/mol, 2.6 \u00d710 \u22129 emu/mol\u2022K 2 , 0.0024 emu\u2022K/mol and 1.7 K, respectively. The parameter C gives the small effective magnetic moment of 0.14 \u00b5 B . The small positive \u03b8 value suggests the existence of weak ferromagnetic correlations. The unusually large \u03c7 0 value should be dominantly con- tributed by \u03c7 P auli , which is probably enhanced by the Stoner-type ferromagnetic correlation. The Wilson ra- tio, R W = \u03c0 2 k 2 B \u03c7 P auli /3\u03b3\u00b5 2 B , is calculated to be 11, in sharp contrast with the case of heavy fermion supercon- ductor . At 4.3 K, specific heat anomalies can be seen, which is ascribed to the superconducting transition. The spe- cific heat jump at the T c under zero field, \u2206C obs , is 6.9 mJ/K\u2022mol-f.u, further confirming the bulk superconduc- tivity. When applying magnetic field, both the \u2206C obs and T c decrease as expected.It is noted that the T c (H) values are basically consistent with the H c2 (T ) result de- scribed above.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"\"], \"tcs\": [\"4.3 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"specific heat\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - tc: 4.3 K, me_methods: specific heat\n"}]}

The anhydrous parent compound Na 0.61(1) CoO 2 has two partially occupied Na sites sandwiched, in the same plane, between CoO 2 layers. When Na is removed to make the superconducting composition, the Na site that experiences the strongest Na-Co repulsion is emptied while the occupancy of the other Na site is reduced to about one third.  The deuterate superconducting compound is formed by coordinating four D 2 O molecules (two above and two below) to each remaining Na ion in a way that gives Na-O distances nearly equal to those in the parent compound. One deuteron of the D 2 O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO 2 plane and the oxygen atom and the second deuteron of each D 2 O molecule lie approximately in a plane between the Na layer and the CoO 2 layers.This coordination of Na by four D 2 O molecules leads in a straightforward way to ordering of the Na ions and D 2 O molecules consistent with the observation of additional shorter-range scattering features in the diffraction data.  The sample studied here, which has T c =4.5 K, has a refined composition of Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 \u20221.25(2)D 2 O, in agreement with the expected 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O.

The hydrated superconducting compound may be stable over a limited range of Na and D 2 O concentration, but studies of T c and other physical properties vs.Na or D 2 O composition should be viewed with caution until it is verified that the compound remains in the same phase over the composition range of the study.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 \\u20221.25(2)D 2 O\"], \"tcs\": [\"4.5 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 \u20221.25(2)D 2 O, tc: 4.5 K\n"}]}

This ordered structure has the ideal composition Na x CoO 2 \u20224xD 2 O with x=1/3 when all Na and D 2 O sites are occupied. The refined composition, Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 \u20221.25(2)D 2 O, suggests that the maximum T c is achieved at a composition slightly off the ideal composition, in agreement with other reports for the composition at maximum T c .   In the sample studied here, which was made in a way that places the composition at a plateau in partial pressure of D 2 O in equilibrium with the sample, the ideal 1:4 Na to D 2 O ratio is maintained, even though the sample is slightly deficient in both Na and D 2 O compared to the ideal model. Other reports indicate that a higher water content can be achieved for an Na content of x\u22480.3.It is perhaps possible that additional water could be accommodated using the space made available by Na vacancies for the x\u22480.3 composition (see Fig . ) . One can visualize a hydrogen-bonded network of D 2 O molecules occupying the available space in a way consistent with the pattern of symmetry equivalent positions shown in Fig . .

Baskaran has presented a theory based on the idea that the highest T c in this system occurs between the compositions Na 1/3 and Na 1/4 that would be expected to give ordered phases.   One hypothesis of his theory is that ordering of Na ions would promote charge ordering of the Co atoms, which, in turn, would suppress superconductivity.Thus, the ordered phases at the ideal compositions x=1/3 and 1/4 would be unfavorable for superconductivity.  In agreement with these ideas, the maximum T c is achieved at a Na concentration below x=1/3.  However, the present results show that the optimal superconducting composition displays ordering, over an in-plane coherence length of ~1000 \u00c5, the same as for the ideal x=1/3 composition.  The increase of T c upon decreasing the Na content from x=1/3 could simply be a doping effect, as proposed by Schaak et al.To better understand this behavior, it is important to understand what happens when the Na concentration is further reduced toward the composition x=1/4, which corresponds to a different ordered structure in Baskaran's model.  Fig . shows a possible ordered structure with this Na concentration. At this Na concentration, each Na ion can achieve sixfold coordination to D 2 O molecules.  This is also the most common coordination for Na oxide and hydrate structures. The present data give no evidence for the occurrence of this ordered compound.However, if it does form at the Na composition x=1/4, the data of Schaak et al. for T c vs. composition may have a different interpretation.The drop in T c from 4.5 K to 2 K upon decreasing the Na concentration from 0.30 to 0.26 may result from a transition from the Na 1/3 to the Na 1/4 phase.If this is the case, the conclusion that the dome-like behavior of T c mimics the behavior seen in the layered cuprates [5] may be premature.Clearly, a careful structural study of a composition near x=1/4 must be pursued.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Na concentration from 0.30 to 0.26\"], \"tcs\": [\"from 4.5 K to 2 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Na concentration from 0.30 to 0.26, tc: from 4.5 K to 2 K\n"}]}

The deuteration of Na leads to the formation of 2D 2 O-Na-2D 2 O \"pillars\" extending between the CoO 2 planes. This interesting \"pillar\" structure is further stabilized by hydrogen bonding within the planes of the D 2 O molecules to form zigzag D-O\u2022D-O\u2022D-O. chains. These structural results are in contrast to initial reports that implied that the material could be viewed a solid solution that could intercalate both Na and D 2 O in varying amounts. The ideal composition of the superconducting phase is Na x CoO 2 \u20224xD 2 O (x\u22481/3).  The sample studied here has a refined Na composition of x=0.31(3) and a perfect 1:4 Na to D 2 O ratio (within one esd) consistent with the ideal structure, but with vacancy defects on both the Na and D 2 O sites; i.e., entire 2D 2 O-Na-2D 2 O \"pillar\" sites are vacant. . This hydrated phase would be expected to exist only within rather narrow composition limits.For x\u22651/3, fourfold coordination of Na by D 2 O molecules cannot be achieved.  As x approaches 1/4, a different ordered phase, involving sixfold coordination of the Na, could be formed.Thus, measurements of physical properties, such as T c, vs. composition should be viewed with caution until it is confirmed that all samples in a particular study are in the same phase.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Na x CoO 2 \\u2022yD 2 O\"], \"tcs\": [\"4.5 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Na x CoO 2 \u2022yD 2 O, tc: 4.5 K\n"}]}

The upper critical field of a superconductor is determined by the combined effect of an external magnetic field on the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the conduction electrons.  Werthamer et al. have worked out a theory for H c2 which includes both spin and orbital paramagnetic effects as well as nonmagnetic and spin-orbit scattering .

One reason for the conflict might be that the doping level of Bi-2212 in the region of the junction is not the same as in the bulk.

One may assume that increasing hole doping makes the Bi-2212 normal-state more Fermi-liquid-like, leading possibly to an s-wave BCS super- conductor. There are ARPES observations that suggest s-wave BCS behavior in the heavily overdoped phase . However, the tunneling subgap conductance shapes at low tempera- tures in figs. 1(a) and (b) are not consistent with the s-wave BCS theory prediction which is supposed to be flat near zero bias. Here what we observed is that the d-wave-like sub- gap structure persists at the T c = 56 K overdoped Bi-2212. shows the normalized tunneling conductance of SIS break junction # 1 at 4.2 K (dots) which is given in .  Since the tunneling conductance is flat above T c , the data have been normalized by a con- stant. The fit is generated using a d-wave gap function, \u2206 = \u2206 0 cos(2\u03b8), in the BCS DOS, Here, \u0393 is a smearing parameter to account for quasiparticle lifetime.  The SIS conductance is calculated by where c is a proportionality constant.F (E) is the Fermi function. The formula also includes a directionality function f (\u03b8)=1+\u03b1 cos(4\u03b8) which corresponds to a preferred tunneling along the d-wave lobes. Here \u03b1 is the directionality strength, which is assumed temperature independent (\u03b1 = 0.4) . The fit (solid line in ) shows good agreement in the subgap region with the experimental data. Thus there appears to be no change of symmetry away from d-wave. However for |eV | > 2\u2206 the data deviate from the BCS d-wave fit, exhibiting broader peak widths and the dip feature. In general, these features are compensating which allows conservation of states; however, the data in lead to an integrated area out to 150 meV which is about 6% above the BCS d-wave fit.

It is natural to expect these reactions, as sulfur can be not only divalent, but also exhibits higher valencies.

At low temperatures, its temperature dependence is directly re- lated to the density of low energy quasiparticles, which in turn can be related to the anisotropy of the supercon- ducting energy gap on the Fermi surface. For investiga- tion of the low lying excitations and thus the anisotropy of the energy gap, the analysis is considerably less am- biguous if measurements are performed on high quality single crystal and temperatures well below T c /3. In this paper we report magnetic penetration depth measure- ments on single crystals B 0.63 K 0.37 BiO 3 (T c \u2248 31 K) down to 0.4 K.  The investigation of mechanisms of super- conductivity in B 1\u2212x K x BiO 3 (BKBO) system has been one of the important subjects in studies of high T c su- perconductivity in oxide materials. The significance of BKBO lies in observations that some of its supercon- ducting properties are consistent with the conventional s-wave isotropic superconductivity, but others are resem- bling high-T c cuprates.   In particular, substantial iso- tope effect , strong phonon contribution from the neutron scattering measurements , and a supercon- ducting gap with 2\u2206 0 /T c =3.5\u00b10.3 from the tunnelling and optical experiments indicate significant role of electron-phonon interactions in mechanism of su- perconductivity of BKBO.However the low density of states at the Fermi level with T c as high as 30K and insulator-superconductor transition by doping are similar to high-T c cuprates.However, in contrast to high T c cuprates which have two dimensional CuO 2 planes, BKBO has simple three dimensional cubic perovskite structure.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"B 0.63 K 0.37 BiO 3\"], \"tcs\": [\"31 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: B 0.63 K 0.37 BiO 3, tc: 31 K\n"}]}

However, recent scanning tunneling spectroscopic studies have shown that the pairing symmetry may be dependent on the hole-doping concentration, with \u0351d x 2 2y 2 1 s\u0352 mixed symmetries in certain overdoped cuprates such as \u0351Y 12x Ca x \u0352Ba 2 Cu 3 O 72d .  Furthermore, whether the pairing symmetry is d x 2 2y 2 or s wave in the one- layer n-type cuprates such as Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d and Pr 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 42d remains controversial , and it has been suggested that the pairing symmetry in the one-layer n-type cuprates may change from d x 2 2y 2 to s, depending on the electron doping level . The nonuniversal pairing symmetries in cuprate superconductors imply that the sym- metry is likely the result of competing orders rather than a sufficient condition for pairing.    Nonetheless, an important consequence of either d x 2 2y 2 or \u0351d x 2 2y 2 1 s\u0352-wave pairing is that the resulting nodal quasiparticles can interact strongly with the quantum impurities in the CuO 2 planes , such that a small concentration of impurities can give rise to strong suppression of superconductivity and modification of the collective Cu 21 spin excitations .In addition, Kondo effects could be induced by nonmagnetic impurities through breaking the nearest- neighbor antiferromagnetic Cu 21 -Cu 21 interaction . Such strong response to nonmagnetic impurities is in sharp contrast to conventional s-wave superconductivity .Despite significant progress in the studies of cuprate superconductivity, the research on the simplest form of cuprates, the infinite-layer system Sr 12x L x CuO 2 (L La, Gd, Sm), has been limited due to the difficulties in making single-phase samples with complete superconduct- ing volume.  Recently, Jung et al. have demonstrated single-phase samples of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 with nearly 100% superconducting volume and a sharp superconducting tran- sition temperature at T c 43 K, thus enabling reliable spectroscopic studies of the pairing symmetry and the ef- fects of quantum impurities. These single-phased infinite- layer cuprates are n-type with P4\u035emmm symmetry, which differ significantly from other cuprates in that no excess charge reservoir block exists between consecutive CuO 2 planes except a single layer of Sr(La), as illustrated in , suggesting stronger CuO 2 interplanar coupling.  Furthermore, the c-axis superconducting coherence length \u0351j c 0.53 nm\u0352 is found to be longer than the c-axis lattice constant \u0351c 0 0.347 nm\u0352 , in stark contrast to other cuprate superconductors with j c \u00f8 c 0 .Hence, the super- conducting properties of the infinite-layer system are ex- pected to be more three-dimensional, as opposed to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of all other cuprates.In this Letter, we report experimental findings based on the scan- ning tunneling spectroscopy studies of pure infinite-layer samples and those with a small concentration (1%) of ei- ther magnetic or nonmagnetic quantum impurities.A num- ber of surprising results are found and compared with the established phenomena in other cuprates.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2\"], \"tcs\": [\"43 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2, tc: 43 K\n"}]}

Nucleation of SC has long been considered highly unfavorable if not impossible near ferromagnetism (FM) 1-5 , in low dimensionality 6,7 and, above all, out of non-superconductor. Here we report observation of SC with TC near 4 K in Ni/Bi bilayers that defies all known paradigms of superconductivity, where neither ferromagnetic Ni film nor rhombohedra Bi film is superconducting in isolation 8 .   This highly unusual SC is independent of the growth order (Ni/Bi or Bi/Ni), but highly sensitive to the constituent layer thicknesses.Most importantly, the SC, distinctively non-s pairing, is triggered from, but does not occur at, the Bi/Ni interface. Using point contact Andreev reflection (AR) 9 , we show evidences that the unique SC, naturally compatible with magnetism, is triplet p-wave pairing. This work might open a new door to explore novel SC which could lead to potential applications in superconducting spintronics 10,11.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Ni/Bi bilayers\"], \"tcs\": [\"near 4 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Ni/Bi bilayers, tc: near 4 K\n"}]}

Electron probe micro- analysis and x-ray diffraction showed that all samples were single phase within an accuracy of \u2248 1%. The fully oxygenated, \u03b4 = 0.0 (YBCO 7 , T c = 92 K), samples were prepared by annealing bulk pieces in pure oxygen atmo- sphere at 380 o C for 24 hours and then slowly cooling to room temperature.  (Hereafter T c represents the temper- ature where the onset of superconductivity occurs in the ac susceptibility data for a measuring field H ac = 3 G rms and frequency f = 333 Hz.)  The \u03b4 = 0.3 (YBCO 6.7 , T c = 66 K) sample was prepared by annealing in pure oxygen atmosphere at 650 o C for 12 h and then quench- ing in liquid nitrogen, while the \u03b4 = 0.43 (YBCO 6.57 , T c = 56 K) sample was annealed in 0.2% O 2 / N 2 atmo- sphere at 550 o C for 12 hours and also quenched into liq- uid nitrogen.      The final oxygen contents were determined from the weight change of a fully oxygenated reference sample.The \u03b4 = 0.0 bulk piece was lightly ground and sedimented in acetone to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution. The sedimented powders were then heat treated to repair any structural damages to the surface of the grains.For \u03b4 = 0.3 and 0.43 on the other hand a bulk piece for each \u03b4 was lightly ground and sieved through a 20 \u00b5m sieve in an argon glove box to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution and to avoid surface degradation of the crystallites. The collected powders were then kept in argon atmosphere for 30 min before be- ing aligned.All powders, \u03b4 = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.43, were mag- netically aligned in epoxy as described earlier. The average grain diameters corresponding to the 50% cumu- lative volume point were 5 and 10 \u00b5m for the fully oxy- genated and the oxygen deficient samples, respectively.  The fraction of the unoriented powder in all grain aligned samples was estimated to be < 5 %.  Rocking curve anal- ysis of the \u03b4 = 0.0 and \u03b4 > 0.0 samples gave a full width at half maximum of \u00b1 1.4 and 1 o , respectively.

Recent tunnel spectroscopy results, on the other hand, claimed the presence of an isotropic gap with a magnitude more than 40% higher than that reported earlier .  The spread of gap values measured up to now range between 1.6 meV and 2.3 meV .

For CsOs 2 O 6 and RbOs 2 O 6 , they were nearly single-phase including a small amount of Os metal.  For KOs 2 O 6 , 10 mol% of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 was contained as another phase, which was necessary to obtain a sufficiently hard pellet for resistivity measurements. The coexistence of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 may not affect the determination of T c , because it becomes insulating below 230 K .    Electrical resistivity measurements were performed by the four-probe method in a cubic-anvil press apparatus [14] at high pressures from 2 GPa to 10 GPa and temperatures from 3 K to 300 K.A fluorinert liquid, which is a one-to-one mixture of FC-70 and FC-77 (3M TM ), was used as a pressure transmitting medium. A polycrystalline pellet of a typical size of 0.8 \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 0.4 mm 3 was immersed into the fluorinert liquid in a cylindrical teflon capsule of 1.5 \u03c6 \u00d7 1.8 mm 3 size.Then, the capsule was put into a cubic pyrophillite block of 6.0 mm edge and compressed almost isostatically by using six anvils made of tungsten carbide.  The whole of the sample cell and the press was placed in a liquid-helium dewar to cool down to 3 K.  Each run of resistivity T 2 , as shown in the inset to Fig.3(a) for RbOs 2 O 6 , to determine A and \u03c1 0 . The slope of the T 2 term in RbOs 2 O 6 is large at 2 GPa and does not change much up to 3 GPa near the T c maximum.Then it decreases very much from 4 GPa to 7 GPa, where T c decreases and finally disappears, and then increases again at 8 GPa and 10 GPa. The origin of an upturn observed at low temperatures above 7 GPa is not known and it is ignored in evaluating A and \u03c1 0 .  Such an upturn was not detected in our recent experiment using a better quality of sample.   The same analysis has been carried out for CsOs 2 O 6 .   The resulting pressure dependences of A and \u03c1 0 are summarized in Fig. 4.  In order to deduce a general trend, each quantity has been normalized by the value at the maximum of the T c dome. Pressure is also normalized as P n = ( P -P* ) / ( P c -P* ), where P* is a pressure at the T c maximum and P c is a critical pressure where superconductivity disappears; that is, P n = 0 for P = P* and P n = 1 for P = P c .For KOs 2 O 6 , only T c is plotted, because we could not obtain reliable data due to the presence of impurities. It becomes apparent now that normalized T c falls on a universal curve. Either normalized A and \u03c1 0 is connected smoothly between RbOs 2 O 6 and CsOs 2 O 6 to show a general curve: Normalized A exhibits a broad maximum near the T c maximum and a minimum near P c , while normalized \u03c1 0 shows a minimum near P* and a maximum near P c . In the framework of Fermi liquid theory, A is proportional to square of effective mass of carriers or density of states at the Fermi level.Thus, the above results on A imply that the carrier mass is enhanced significantly at the T c maximum owing to correlation effects. This strongly suggests that the mechanism of superconductivity in the \u03b2-pyrochlore 4 oxides is relevant to electron correlations. On the other hand, residual resistivity is generally expressed by the equation \u03c1 0 = ( \u0127 / e 2 l ) ( 3 \u03c0 2 ) 1/3 n -2/3 , where l is the mean free path of carriers and n is carrier density. The mean free path at low temperature may be determined by the concentration of impurities or defects and thus should not be affected by pressure.  It is expected, however, that the mean free path would be reduced largely by quantum fluctuations developing toward absolute zero, which often exist near a quantum critical point associated with a certain long-range order such as a magnetic transition or valence transition [16,17].   The observed enhancement in \u03c1 0 near P c may indicate that there is an unknown long-range order at higher pressure. Possibly, the sudden recovery of metallic behavior observed below 100 K at 10 GPa in RbOs 2 O 6 (Fig.3(b) is related to this long range order.   It is plausible that the associated quantum fluctuations would suppress the superconductivity, giving rise to a dome-shaped T c variation.  The observed dome-shaped change in T c and the corresponding unusual variations in A and \u03c1 0 must reflect unconventional features of superconductivity in the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxides. However, it seems that they are quite different from those observed in well-known unconventional superconductors, such as f-electron intermetallic compounds or low-dimensional organic conductors [12,18]. A typical f-electron compound CeCu 2 Ge 2 exhibits a large reduction in A and a sharp peak in \u03c1 0 at the T c maximum, which is believed to be induced by valence fluctuations [12,16,17]. In the present \u03b2-pyrochlores osmium ions are formally in a 5.5 valent state with two and a half 5d electrons.It is interesting to note that this number of 5d electrons is just between two integer values for Re 5+ ions (5d 2 ) in 1 K superconductor Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 and Os 5+ ions (5d 3 ) in Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 exhibiting a metal-to-insulator transition [13, 19].However, we think that valence fluctuations may not play a primary role in the \u03b2-pyrochlores, because the band width of Os 5d -O 2p hybridized bands is large, ~3 eV, from the band structure calculations [20-22].The most plausible scenario for quantum fluctuations is to assume electronic instability associated with Fermi surface nesting.Harima has pointed out that an important general feature on the band structure of the \u03b2-pyrochlores is the existence of a pair of Fermi surfaces of nearly octahedral shape which forms a thin shell centered at the \u0393 point.Thus, strong Fermi surface nesting and resulting spin-density-wave instability are expected.Moreover, a 'dimple' grows on the octahedral Fermi surface from K to Cs, suggesting that the nesting becomes weaker along this line.It would be interesting to test how this feature changes under high pressure.In order to clarify the existence of possible quantum fluctuations in the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxides and their relevance to the superconductivity, further experiments are required under high pressures.In summary, we have obtained interesting and characteristic behavior in the pressure dependence of T c and other parameters in the \u03b2-pyrochlore oxides AOs 2 O 6 by measuring resistivity under high pressure up to 10 GPa.Generally, the T c shows a dome-like shape as a function of pressure.The variations of the coefficient A of the T 2 term and the residual resistivity \u03c1 0 are also anomalous and synchronized with the change in T c .These results suggest that electron correlations enhance the superconductivity, while certain quantum fluctuations give rise to the degradation of T c at higher pressure.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Cd 2 Re 2 O 7\"], \"tcs\": [\"1 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Cd 2 Re 2 O 7, tc: 1 K\n"}]}

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support a presence of several magnetic phases for the V sublattice. Provided there is a linear relation between \u03b4 and the lattice volume, a-\u03b4 and c-\u03b4 curves change systematically with \u03b4. Bulk superconductivity are observed in the samples with 0.031 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.145. The samples with 0.204 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.664 show normal conductivity at T > 2 K, although SC-traces were observed in the samples with 0.204 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.237.   These SC-traces are mainly due to the magnetic phase segregation.The highest T c onset and T c mid were 37.1 K and 34.1 K, respectively, for \u03b4 = 0.145 sample. A spontaneous magnetic moment (M S ) of the V appears for the samples with 0.124 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 0.631. The M S exhibits a maximum value of ~0.5 \uf06d B (f.u.) \u22121 for \u03b4 = 0.267 sample.    0.124 \u2264 \u03b4 \u22640.631 samples exhibit magnetic transition temperatures of the V ranging from 25 to 308 K.   57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spctra of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 exhibit PM phase of the Fe sublattice for superconducting \u03b4 = 0.124 sample and normalconducting samples with \u03b4 = 0.232 and 0.237, whereas AFM phases of Fe appear at T < 11.9 K, 17.5 K, and 23.1 K for the samples with \u03b4 = 0.267, 0.509, and 0.631.Our DFT calculations show that a stable AFM phase of the V can be switched, depending on the \u03b4, because the stability of the magnetic phases are quite similar in energy. In addition, our DFT calculations indicate that the Ferri. phase of the V is the most stable in the samples with \u03b4 = 0.25.Based on these results, an electronic and magnetic phase diagram of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 is constructed with respect to \u03b4. This phase diagram provides an evidence that there is no coexisting AFM phase of the Fe sublattice with SC, although a higher maximum of T c appears near a boundary between the AFM and Ferri. phases of V. Magnetic and valence states of the V dominate T c of Sr 2 VFeAsO 3\u2212\u03b4 indirectly.   This phase diagram extends our knowledge to understand optimum chemical compositions for the superconductivity of iron-based MALC and should help understand the mechanism of enhancing T c in multinary transition metals-based MALC; promising materials for superconducting applications under high magnetic fields.

Namely, the value of 1.5\u00b5m that we obtained for a slightly overdoped sample by the ac-susceptibility technique corresponds to the simple situation where there is no normal state gap.  Although the values of Kirtley et al. and Basov et al. correspond to samples with high values of T c (96K) the results shown here strongly suggest that their values of \u03bb c (0) correspond to significantly lower doping levels where the normal state gap comes into play.  In this sense our results support the ILT model-since the only clear exception to this model is now the Tl-2201 compound .However, we should note that for any pairing mechanism (not just ILT) the presence of the normal state gap also leads to a similar correlation be- tween the condensation energy, and the superfluid den- sity, i.e., \u03bb c (0) and \u03bb ab (0) .  There are also dis- tinct differences between \u03bb c and \u03bb ab . The anisotropy \u03b3 increases on the underdoped side and the T -dependences at low temperatures (at T < 0.3T c ) are very different.

Details on possible mechanisms leading to these power laws can be found in ref. .Therefore, it is not imme- diately obvious that the qualitative similarities between \u03bb c (T ) and \u03bb ab (T ) shown in Fig. can be understood within the ILT theory where interplane Josephson effects dominate the c-axis electrodynamics.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Hg-1201\"], \"tcs\": [\"96K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Hg-1201, tc: 96K\n"}]}

In particular, unconventional su- perconductivity has been expected in this compound be- cause of the unique crystal structure in the CoO 2 layer al- though the superconducting transition temperature T c \u2243 5 K is one order of magnitude smaller than that in High-T c copper oxide superconductors.   The CoO 2 layer is formed by the hexagonal arrangement of the Co ions, which is in contrast to the tetragonal arrangement of the Cu ions in the copper oxides.A deficiency of the sodium atom leads to dope 0.65 holes into the layer of the insu- lating low-spin (S = 0) state of Co +3 .  This hole doping results in 0.35 electrons doped in the triangular lattice consisting of S = 1/2 of Co +4 . Such triangular magnetic lattice is regarded as having magnetic frustration and one may expect that unconventional superconductivity is realized on the basis of such frustration. Then just af- ter finding the superconductivity in the present material, many theoretical proposals of possible unconventional superconductivity have been presented. The exper- imental investigation on the superconductivity, however, has not progressed so much because of difficulty of get- ting the single crystal. It is highly desirable to obtain the basic superconducting parameters in magnetic field, for example, the upper critical field H c2 , the coherence length \u03be, and those anisotropy.These basic material pa- rameters must be important to understand NMR and NQR results reported so far, which should give cru- cial information about the pairing symmetry and the gap anisotropy.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Na 0.35 CoO 2 \\u20221.3H 2 O\"], \"tcs\": [\"5 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u20221.3H 2 O, tc: 5 K\n"}]}

This phenomenon was also observed in the Y Sr 2 Cu 2.7 F e 0.3 O 7+\u03b4 superconductor and in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 superconductor ob- tained by high oxygen pressure synthesis.  In these superconductors, the diffraction peaks of (006) and (200) shift systematically to higher angle degree with the increase of oxygen content, which is similar to our results. All our HP-samples have smaller lattice parameters a and c than the corresponding AM-samples, and the lattice unit cell of HP-samples displays an obvious shrinkage.   Since the relative shrinkage is not more bigger than other samples an- nealed under high oxygen pressure, and also for that F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 sample can be made superconducting without high pressure synthesis, thereby this shrinkage can be attributed to the increase of oxygen content, but not the pressure effect caused by the high pressure synthesis procedure.Then it can be deduced that in all F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 (Ba 1\u2212x Sr x ) 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 samples the oxygen content increased after high pressure synthesis, which is validated by the oxygen content measurement in F e 0.5 Cu 0.5 BaSrY Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 system where 7+\u03b4 increased from 7.20(2) in AM-sample to 7.35(2) in HP-sample. The increased oxygen content provided the required charge which made the semiconducting-like AM-samples changed to supercon- ducting HP-samples. The diffusion of F e atom into CuO 2 planes in R-123 systems is believed to be very unfavorable for superconductivity because of its magnetic moment, and with the increase of F e concentration, this diffusion is inevitable in samples synthesized by common solid-state reaction .     J.Shimoyama et al. used a complex annealing procedure which is believed to suppress the incorporation of F e to the CuO 2 planes in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 system, and finally made it superconducting with T c \u223c 60K.Using neutron powder diffraction studies, T.Mochiku et al. investigated the site-mixing between F e and Cu atoms in F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 samples synthesized through different procedures, and proved that simply increasing the oxygen content could not produce superconductivity and the ordered distribution of F e and Cu atoms between Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites is also one of the key points to the origin of superconductivity.In our heavily F e-doped R-1212 systems, high pressure synthesis procedure is believed to promote the transfer of F e atoms from Cu(2) site to Cu(1) site, and to make almost all the F e atoms to occupy the Cu(1) chain site.This redistribution of F e atoms is a needed requirement to ensure the occurrence of superconductivity, while the increase of oxygen content provides the needed amount of charge.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\\u03b4\"], \"tcs\": [\"60K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: F eSr 2 Y Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4, tc: 60K\n"}]}

The estimated extra entropy down to 1.4K is about 43.2mJ/mol, which is only 0.25% of the 3Rln2, the value that is expec- ted for Cu 2+ free spins.Although this upturn behavior looks interesting, the possibility of con- tributions from small amounts of impurity phases (-0.5%) cannot be ruled out, as already pointed out above.However, the origin of the non-zero 7 value at low temperatures is not yet under- stood clearly.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"YBa2Cu307\"], \"tcs\": [\"91.8 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"specific heat\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: YBa2Cu307, tc: 91.8 K, me_methods: specific heat\n"}]}

Ca x Ba 2 (Cu 1-y Zn y ) 3 O 7-\u03b4 is surprising considering the widely held belief that the energy scale of the PG is determined by p, and T * (p) either falls below or merges with the T c (p) line in the OD side.  In a previous magnetic susceptibility study, Cooper and Loram 34 observed a PG-like feature in fully oxygenated sintered 7%Zn-Y123, where superconductivity was almost completely suppressed with Zn.  Vobornik et al. also observed a pseudogap in ARPES experiments for disordered optimally doped Bi-2212 single crystals 35 .For Bi-2212, in-plane disorder was introduced by electron irradiation and T c was reduced from 90K to 62K.  \u03c1 ab (T) was also measured but no high-T downturn in resistivity for this 62K optimally doped Bi-2212 was found 35 .  In the light of present results, a possible reason might be that the sample was not \"sufficiently\" disordered, since we also did not see any anomalous effect in our 3%, 4%, and 5%Zn samples (where T c was suppressed by ~ 30K, ~ 40K, and ~ 46K respectively, near the optimum doping).  Notice that all the previous observations of disorder induced PG were for samples that are slightly OD and optimally doped respectively . Here we have reported this effect over a fairly wide doping range from p = 0.205 to 0.11.It is fair to say that there are two main effects of Zn substitution for Cu(2) in cuprates : (i) Zn tends to localize carriers in the CuO 2 plane (depending on temperature and Zn content) and (ii) it gives rise to \"Curie- like magnetic moments\" possibly on the four neighboring Cu sites (in the presence of short-range antiferromagnetically correlated background).  Recent 63 Cu NMR and inelastic neutron scattering studies suggest that Zn enhances the AF correlation in Y123. There is growing evidence that an AF background with short-range order does not exist in overdoped cuprates with p > 0.19 . The situation in highly disordered samples could be different, especially if there is phase segregation, and only a very weak form of superconductivity is present.  Under these circumstances Zn induced enhancement of short-range AF correlation might be a possibility for highly disordered Y 1-x Ca 1-x Ba 2 (Cu 1- y Zn y ) 3 O 7-\u03b4 irrespective of the hole content.It is very interesting to note that both the effects of Zn substitution (enhancement of short-range AF correlation or/and carrier localization in the CuO 2 plane) can be directly linked to the existence of the pseudogap.   AF fluctuation has been held widely responsible for (or at least partly contributing to) the formation of the PG by various theoretical and experimental studies .In another scenario, using the t-J model, strong Coulomb repulsion has been taken as responsible for both pseudogap and superconducting pairing . In the VHS scenario leads to localization of carriers and thus weakens the electrostatic screening, which, in turn effectively increases the Coulomb interaction.  As Zn plays a similar role on carrier transport in the CuO 2 planes, it can give rise to a pseudogap in the VHS scenario. It is hard to reconcile any precursor-pairing picture with this anomalous T * (p).On the other hand, scenarios in which the PG originates from correlations that are not related and compete with superconductivity, can possibly offer an explanation. In the competing correlations scenario T * (p) and T c (p) are detrimental to each other and the growth of one is accompanied by the decrease of the other (at least in the pure compounds). Kohno et al. 45 have in fact shown in their theoretical analysis that disorder can indeed strengthen one competing phase (AF) significantly over the other (e.g., superconductivity). The abrupt appearance of this anomalous PG-like feature in resistivity as a function of disorder content is indicative of some sort of threshold mechanism in action, consistent with some recent theoretical studies 5,46 . For example, in the study by Monthoux 5 it was shown that as quasiparticle life-time becomes shorter (with increasing scattering by spin fluctuations), it starts to \"feel\" long-range magnetic order even when only short-range correlations are present. The quasiparticle mean-free path relative to the correlation length of the short-range AF order determines the size of the pseudogap. As the quasiparticle life-time decreases with Zn, it is possible that at a certain level of Zn in the CuO 2 plane the scattering rate becomes high enough to dominate over the more gradual p-dependent scattering.  Using the Hubbard model, it was shown that a high scattering rate leads to the removal of low-energy spectral weight .In this scenario the local Coulomb repulsion, U, is the important parameter.Heavy Zn substitution increases the scattering rate, localizes quasiparticles and effectively enhances U/t (where t is the nearest-neighbor hopping energy) globally.Once U > 8t, the pseudogap becomes insensitive to U and therefore, should not show significant p- dependence .Roughly speaking, the mean distance between Zn impurities, l i , in the CuO 2 plane is given by ~ r/\u221az pl , where z pl = 3y/2 and r ~ 3.9\u00c5 is the distance between Cu atoms in the plane.For y = 0.06, l i ~ 13\u00c5, close to the value of the in-plane superconducting coherence length, This should imply that once the distance between Zn atoms becomes comparable with the superconducting coherence length, abrupt changes in the various normal and superconducting state properties take place.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Bi-2212\", \"optimally doped Bi-2212\"], \"tcs\": [\"62K\", \"62K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Bi-2212, tc: 62K\n  - material: optimally doped Bi-2212, tc: 62K\n"}]}

The small diamagnetic signal below 42 K is assigned to the intra-grain superconductivity whereas the larger signal below 30 K is due to the inter-grain shielding signal.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8\"], \"tcs\": [\"42 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8, tc: 42 K\n"}]}

The essential feature of this structure is the presence of infi- nite Zr 6/2 X 3 chains of confacial antiprisms of metal Zr on which the shared edges are bridged by isolated p-element atoms (anions) X, as shown in figure 1. The octahedral interstitial sites at the center of these confacial chains have been the subject of many studies, especially on the stabili- zation of pseudo-binary and ternary compounds with the Mn 5 Si 3 structure. Superconductivity has been reported firstly in Zr 5 Sb 3 with T c \u223c2.3 K, and later in the Ru-doped Zr 5 Sb 3 and Hf 5 Sb 3 (with structure changing from Mn 5 Si 3 type to W 5 Si 3 type upon doping).   Recently, we have successfully induced superconductivity in the Ru-doped Zr 5 Ge 3 system, which remains the Mn 5 Si 3 type structure upon chemical doping, with a possible unconventional superconductivity signature. Surprisingly, the superconductivity induction is doping-site-selective.With the same Ru doping, super- conductivity only occurs with doping at the Ge site and remains absent with doping at the Zr site or an interstitial site above 1.8 K.  This indicates some other competing factors, other than charge carrier changes caused by doping, may also play an important role. In this paper, we have taken an alternative approach to examining this issue, and carried out systematic doping studies at different sites for the Zr 5 Ge 3 system. Chemical doping effects and structural instabilities caused by doping have been considered and tested for our doping studies in the Zr 5 Ge 3 system. Surprisingly, super- conductivity is only observed in the Pt doped Zr 5 Ge 3\u2212x Pt x system besides our previous report on Zr 5 Ge 3\u2212x Ru x samples.  We do not find superconductivity present in the same struc- ture for Pd, or Ir doping studies in a similar manner above 1.8 K.Furthermore, no superconductivity is observed for chemical doping (both hole and electron) at the Zr site, nor at the structural instability boundaries upon chemical doping in Zr 5 Ge 3 above 1.8 K.Our results suggest that Ge-Ru, and Ge-Pt are likely the critical charge-transfer pairs for the induced superconductivity, similar to the Sb-Ru pair reported in Zr 5 Sb 3\u2212x Ru x and Hf 5 Sb 3\u2212x Ru x compounds.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Zr 5 Sb 3\"], \"tcs\": [\"\\u223c2.3 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Zr 5 Sb 3, tc: \u223c2.3 K\n"}]}

One can clearly see that superconductivity is only observed in the Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5 sample, and the other samples with the same doping level remain as poor metals in the measured temperature range above 1.9 K.The decreased residual-resistance ratio (RRR) in all the doped samples is expected from the enhanced scattering at low temperature caused by chemical doping.  It is worthwhile to note that sometimes a small drop of resistivity is observed in the Ir- containing samples, which is attributed to small impurities of the superconducting Zr-Ir alloy that is not detectable from XRD, but is evidenced from later SEM analysis. Apparently, the Pt element, similar to Ru, is critical for the induced superconductivity in the Zr 5 Ge 3 system.  Similarly, the induced superconductivity through Pt doping is also found to be site-selective.As shown in (b), with the same amount of Pt doping, only the Ge site doped sample Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5 is superconducting at 2.8 K, and the samples doped at the Zr site Zr 4.5 Pt 0.5 Ge 3 and at the octahedral interstitial site Zr 5 Ge 3 Pt 0.5 are found to be non-super- conducting at our lowest measured temperature.These results further support our hypothesis that critical pairing of Ge-Ru and Ge-Pt is essential for the superconductivity in the Zr 5 Ge 3 compound, similar to the observation found in the Zr 5 Sb 3\u2212x Ru x and Hf 5 Sb 3\u2212x Ru x compounds.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Ge site doped sample Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5\"], \"tcs\": [\"2.8 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"electrical resistivity\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Ge site doped sample Zr 5 Ge 2.5 Pt 0.5, tc: 2.8 K, me_methods: electrical resistivity\n"}]}

Indeed, the magnitude and sign of dT c /dp may indicate a way to rise T c at ambient pressure, and moreover, help to understand the superconducting pairing mechanism.So far, all these studies show that T c decreases with increasing pressure, with a rate depend- ing on the method and the pressure medium used.  The first hydrostatic measurement of T c (p) up to 0.7 GPa, re- veals that T c decreases reversibly under hydrostatic pres- sure at the rate dT c /dp = \u2212 1.11(2) K/GPa. The be- havior of T c (p) with pressure in MgB 2 was attributed to the pressure induced lattice stiffening (increase of the phonon frequency), 5,6 rather than to the decrease in the electronic density of states N(E F ), that is only moder- ately affected by pressure.  Comparison with theoreti- cal calculations supported the view that MgB 2 is a BCS superconductor with moderately strong electron-phonon coupling. Apart from T c , an other relevant superconducting pa- rameter is the magnetic field penetration depth \u03bb.  In fact the so-called superfluid density \u03bb \u22122 is related to the Fermi velocity and to the density of charge carri- ers, and its temperature dependence gives information on the symmetry and on the magnitude of the supercon- ducting gap.A study of pressure effects on \u03bb \u22122 (0) can give important informations on how the electronic de- grees of freedom are affected by lattice modifications and on the nature of the electron-phonon coupling.   Indeed, in cuprates high temperature superconductors (HTS), a huge pressure effect on \u03bb \u22122 (0) was found, in particu- lar in YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 (Y124). Part of this effect was at- tributed to the strong renormalization of the Fermi ve- locity, and therefore to the effective mass, due to the non- adiabatic coupling of the electrons to the lattice. This result is in agreement with the substantial oxygen iso- tope effect found in cuprates and can be in- terpreted in the framework of non-adiabatic theory of superconductivity. 14 In this paper we report measurements of the mag- netic penetration depth under pressure in polycrystalline MgB 2 .The temperature dependence of \u03bb \u22122 (T ) was ex- tracted from the Meissner fraction f measured in a low magnetic field.A small pressure (p) effect on \u03bb \u22122 (0) was found [ \u2206\u03bb \u22122 \u03bb \u22122 = 1.5(9)%], for pressure ranging from 0.15 to 1.13 GPa.Theoretical calculations of the pressure ef- fect on \u03bb(0) confirm the smallness of this effect [ \u2206\u03bb \u22122 \u03bb \u22122 \u2243 1.4%].These results contrast with the huge effect (\u223c 40 %) on \u03bb \u22122 (0) found in the non-adiabatic cuprate super- conductor Y124 in the same range of pressure 8 .\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"MgB 2\"], \"tcs\": [\"39 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: MgB 2, tc: 39 K\n"}]}

The hydrostatic pressure was produced in a copper-beryllium piston cylinder clamp, especially de- signed for magnetization measurements under pressure (see Ref ). The sample was put in a teflon cylin- der and the pressure cell was then filled with Fluorinert FC77 as pressure transmitting medium. The Meissner fraction was calculated from low field magnetization mea- surements (field cooling) performed with a commercial Superconducting Quantum Interference Device.  In the approximation of spherical grains with average radius R, the Meissner fraction can be related to the magnetic pen- etration depth via the Shoenberg formula: 16 (1) Any change in \u03c7/\u03c7 0 due to pressure can be attributed mainly to a change of \u03bb(T ), rather than to a change of R, which is practically pressure independent. The sam- ple was measured at low pressure p L = 0.15 GPa and at the highest pressure available p H = 1.13 GPa. The pres- sure values were determined from a preliminary calibra- tion measurement, where the same sample was measured in the pressure cell together with a small piece of lead. The pressure was detected by measuring the T c shift of lead (T c (0kbar)=7.2K).   We found dT c /dp = \u2212 1.24(5) K/GPa, in good agreement with previous results.The real zero-pressure measurement could not be performed in the pressure cell, since, in order to seal the cell, at least a small pressure had to be applied. In the temperature dependence of the normal- ized magnetization of MgB 2 at p L and p H is shown in the vicinity of T c , together with the zero pressure p Z measurement performed on the same sample in a quartz tube. The T c's were obtained from the intercept of the linear extrapolations (see The magne- tization curves shift systematically with increasing pres- sure towards lower temperature. In the inset of we show the normalized magnetization as a function of the reduced temperature t = T /T c for p L and p H .The identical temperature dependences for both pressure val- ues indicate the absence of stresses in the sample due to pressure.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"lead\"], \"tcs\": [\"7.2K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: lead, tc: 7.2K\n"}]}

This is also supported by the lack of correla- tion between T * and T c.These results that characterize microscopically, for the first time, the zero-T -limit nor- mal state of the copper-oxide superconductors, should pose a constraint on theories for the high-T c supercon- ductivity and may also provide clues for understanding other strongly correlated electron systems such as heavy fermion materials.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"x \\u22640.40\"], \"tcs\": [\"8 \\u223c32 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: x \u22640.40, tc: 8 \u223c32 K\n"}]}

The results of that study were interpreted to show that a hydrostatic pressure of 0.2 GPa is sufficient to stabilize the HTT phase in La 1.48 Nd 0.4 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . Our structural and T c measurements, however, consistently find that a much higher pressure of 4.2 GPa is required to stabilize the HTT structure in this material. One plausible origin for this large discrepancy is the much greater sensitivity of resistivity measurements to the T c values in minority regions such as crystallographic twin boundaries, which may contain LTO2, LTO1 or HTT phases [23] with higher T c values than the bulk phase.   A second possibility is that the pressure in that study was not fully hydrostatic, yielding an exceptionally rapid increase of T c .

In these researches, one of interests is in the relationship between superconducting transition temperature (T c ) and crys- tal structure.  Lee et al. have found the relationship be- tween T c and the bond angle of As-Fe-As, and suggested that the formation of a regular FeAs 4 tetrahedron is im- portant for higher T c . 1) Meanwhile, Kuroki et al. have theoretically suggested that the pnictogen height from the Fe plane (h P n ) and lattice constant are good param- eters to control T c . 2) They pointed out that the nest- ing properties of Fermi surfaces are sensitive to h P n and, that the reduction in lattice constant suppresses superconductivity through the enhancement of the hop- ping between orbitals, and explained the difference in T c among some \"1111\" systems such as LaFeAs(O 1\u2212x ,F x ), NdFeAsO 1\u2212y , LaFePO, and NdFeAsO 1\u2212y under pres- sure. FeSe (\"11\" system) was also found to show a close relationship between T c and crystal structure, especially h P n .     The T c of FeSe, which is 8 K at ambient pressure, increases markedly under pressure, accompanied by a decrease in h P n .The pressure dependence of T c ex- hibits a plateau at approximately 1 GPa. 7) h P n shows a similar pressure dependence to T c , and reproduces the plateau, while the bond angle of Se-Fe-Se is almost un- changed under pressure. 4) NMR studies of FeSe have re- vealed that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations develop under pressure associated with the increase in T c .Results of these studies support that h P n is a key fac- tor for adjusting the nesting properties and T c .Between LaFePO (h P n = 1.12\u00c5) and NdFeAsO 1\u2212y (h P n = 1.38 A), T c increases with increasing h P n , while the T c of FeSe increases with decreasing h P n (h P n = 1.45 \u2192 1.42 A).This suggests that an optimum h P n exists at ap- proximately h P n of NdFeAsO 1\u2212y.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"FeSe\"], \"tcs\": [\"8 K\"], \"pressures\": [\"ambient pressure\"], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: FeSe, tc: 8 K, pressure: ambient pressure\n"}]}

The compound appears to be the first superconducting layered metal oxide involving 3d-transition metals other than copper. The de-intercalation of Na + ions accompanied by an intercalation of water molecules results in a combined doping and c-axis expansion effect effectively reducing the interlayer coupling between the CoO 2 planes and enhancing the two-dimensional character of the structure.  Magnetic susceptibility mea- surements have shown a diamagnetic drop below 5 K ascribed to the onset of superconduc- tivity although the estimated volume fraction is only of the order of 10% of the value for perfect diamagnetism.The high-field dependence of the susceptibility resembles that of the high-T c copper oxides, with little change of the onset but an appreciable broadening of the superconducting transition under increasing magnetic field.  Because of these similarities and the fact that the removal of water suppresses the superconductivity it was suggested that the large separation of the CoO 2 layers and the reduced interaction between them is essential for stabilizing the superconducting state.  The major difference to the square CuO 2 planes of the cuprates is the triangular symmetry of the Co-lattice that may lead to possible frustration effects in the magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetically interacting cobalt spins.Theoretical treatments therefore employ the t-J model on a planar triangular lattice. Different magnetic and superconducting orders, e.g. d-wave superconductivity, 2 a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking d x 2 \u2212y 2 + id xy ground state, and spin triplet superconductivity 4 have been proposed.  To distinguish between different theoretical proposals and to facilitate our basic understanding of superconductivity in Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O far more experimental work needs to be conducted. In particular, the dependence of the superconducting state on the interlayer coupling is of interest. The CoO 2 interlayer coupling should be tuned reversibly by changing the distance between the planes (c-axis lattice parameter) without affecting the chemical composition, i.e. the content of sodium and water.This can be achieved by applying hydrostatic pressure.Because of the strong lattice anisotropy and the weak bonding between the layers (the water molecules are electrically neutral although polarized) it is expected that the compression of the c-axis increases the interlayer coupling and has a major effect on the superconductivity.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"two-dimensional CoO 2 layers in the com- pound Na 0.35 CoO 2 \\u2022yH 2 O\"], \"tcs\": [\"5 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"Magnetic susceptibility mea- surements\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: two-dimensional CoO 2 layers in the com- pound Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O, tc: 5 K, me_methods: Magnetic susceptibility mea- surements\n"}]}

The superconducting transition is well resolved and the onset of diamagnetism causes the decrease of the inductance signal below T c . The vertical drop of I(T) close to 7 K in Fig. indicates the diamagnetic signal from the superconducting transition of the lead manometer and it was used for pressure determination.  With increasing pressure the superconducting transition of the Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O powder shifts to lower temperature and the transition becomes slightly sharper. It is remarkable that the shape and the overall drop of the susceptibility curves do not change appreciably with pressure which indicates that the sample is stable at the applied hydrostatic pressure.  There is no sign of a possible chemical decomposition or loss of water during the experiments. After acquiring the highest pressure data the pressure was almost completely released (a residual pressure of 0.04 GPa was measured) and the susceptibility curve was found in good agreement with the ambient pressure data taken at the start of the experiments.These data are marked by filled squares in Fig. .  This again shows that the sample is stable and the superconducting properties are reversible under hydrostatic pressure. The T c (p) as estimated from the onset of the diamagnetic signal (see inset of Fig. ) is displayed in Fig. . For low pressure the change of T c is relatively small. With increasing pressure the T c decreases faster resulting in a non linear dependence T c (p) as shown in Fig. The solid line is a fit of the data to a parabolic pressure dependence, T c (p) = 4.68 \u2212 0.0047 p \u2212 0.183 p 2 (T c in K and p in GPa).  At the highest pressure of this experiment (1.53 GPa) the superconducting transition dropped to 4.2 K.Extrapolating the parabolic dependence to T c =0 yields a critical pressure of p c \u2243 5 GPa.  The recovery of the T c after pressure release is indicated by the filled square in Fig. 2 (in contrast to the open circles denoting data estimated within the increasing pressure cycle).  It should be noted that in the present experiments the pressure medium was frozen at the superconducting transition temperature.  This may result in deviations from pure hydrostatic conditions and small pressure gradients throughout the sample space could be expected.  Any pressure medium, even He gas at elevated pressure, will solidify at these low temperatures.In order to check on possible pressure gradients we have evaluated the width of the diamagnetic drop of the ac susceptibility in passing the superconducting transition of the lead manometer.The cooling speed was electronically controlled as low as 0.01 K/min.The width of the lead transition (as measured between the 90% and 10% drop of the susceptibility) was even at the highest pressure still below 0.01 K and only slightly larger than the zero pressure value of 0.008 K.If the small difference is attributed to a pressure gradient across the volume of the lead sample the inhomogeneity is less than 0.005 GPa at the maximum pressure of 1.6 GPa.With the Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O samples linear dimension being about 10 times the size of the lead the possible pressure gradients are still small and should not affect the results significantly.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Na 0.35 CoO 2 \\u2022yH 2 O powder\"], \"tcs\": [\"4.2 K\"], \"pressures\": [\"1.53 GPa\"], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O powder, tc: 4.2 K, pressure: 1.53 GPa\n"}]}

In low-T c (i.e. BCS-like, phonon-mediated) superconductivity the negative pressure shift of T c can be explained by a decrease of the electron-phonon coupling constant, \u03bb. \u03bb is proportional to the electronic density of states (DOS) and to the inverse of the average square of the phonon frequency. The application of pressure usually results in an increase of the phonon frequency (phonon \"hardening\" effect) and, in many instances, in a decrease of the DOS. Both effects lead to a decrease of T c , as was recently discussed, for example, in MgB 2 .  The high-T c cuprate superconductors exhibit both positive as well as negative pressure coefficients, depending on the compound and the doping state. For some hole-doped copper oxides a negative dT c /dp was reported in the overdoped regime and partially attributed to a pressure-induced charge transfer but it was also shown that this charge transfer is not the only factor affecting the pressure shift of T c (for an extensive discussion see Ref. ).Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O is, however, an electron-doped system.   This has to be taken into account if the present data are compared with the high-T c cuprates.  For electron-doped cuprates, e.g Sm 1.88 Ce 0.12 CuO 4\u2212y , the pressure coefficient of T c was found to be negative for a large number of systems with different chemical composition and (electron) doping.Thereby, a universal relation between the relative pressure coefficient, dlnT c /dp, and T c was proposed. According to this relation the pressure coefficient for a sample with T c =4.7 K should be of the order of -0.1 to -0.15 GPa \u22121 .The T c -p relation shown in Fig. is nonlinear, however, estimating the average pressure change of T c yields a value of dlnT c /dp=-0.07 GPa \u22121 and calculating the slope of T c (p) at the high pressure end of the graph we get dlnT c /dp=-0.1 GPa \u22121 .These values are in fair agreement with the typical pressure coefficient of an electron- doped high-T c superconductor with a similar ambient pressure T c.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Na 0.35 CoO 2 \\u2022yH 2 O\"], \"tcs\": [\"4.7 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Na 0.35 CoO 2 \u2022yH 2 O, tc: 4.7 K\n"}]}

Synthesis and crystal structure of transition and rare-earth metal oxypnictides (phase 1111) and superconductors based on them 2.1 Methods of synthesis Rather many ways of obtaining LnOMPn 1111-oxypnictides and superconducting materials based on them have been proposed.  These methods differ significantly by the choice of the initial reagents and the conditions of synthesis. Because the superconducting transition has now been reached only for materials based on iron-containing oxyarsenides LnOFeAs, we here mention the methods by which these systems can be obtained and which can be conditionally divided into several main groups (see ).  All polycrystalline (PC) oxyarsenides are obtained using solid-phase synthesis (SPS).Either simple substances are used as reagents or precursors (binary or, more seldom, ternary phases) are first synthesized.  Such precursors are most often binary arsenides or (and) metal oxides. The methods proposed differ in the number of stages, the temperature T and time t of annealing, and the composition of the atmosphere in which the experiment is carried out. The intermediate and final products are sometimes treated under pressure.As an illustration, we briefly present possible ways of obtaining neodymium-containing oxyarsenide NdO 1\u00c0x F x FeAs; whose samples exhibit the critical temperature T c $ 50\u00c051 K close to the highest record for this class of materials.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"NdO 1\\u00c0x F x FeAs\"], \"tcs\": [\"50\\u00c051 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: NdO 1\u00c0x F x FeAs, tc: 50\u00c051 K\n"}]}

The authors used the standard scheme of solid-phase synthesis from a pelleted NdAs Fe Fe 2 O 3 mixture that was annealed in a quartz tube for 36 h at T $ 900 C. At the second stage, the obtained polycrystalline samples were additionally annealed at T 1300 C for two hours at the pressure 6 GPa. The analysis has shown that sufficiently high- quality NdO 0:85 FeAs samples can be obtained without additional thermal and pressure treatment. As a preliminary stage, the methods in included obtaining binary (ternary) phase-reagents NdAs, NdFe 3 As 3 , Nd 2 O 3 , NdF 3 , etc. The authors of developed the so-called single-stage method, which was applied successfully to obtain super- conducting 54.6-K SmO 0:7 F 0:3 FeAs samples.  The method allowed avoiding some intermediate procedures such as grinding, repeated pelleting, and annealing, which is very important in handling toxic substances such as arsenic. The Sm As SmF 3 Fe Fe 2 O 3 mixture was immersed in a tantalum tube sealed on one end. When filled, the Ta tube was closed on the other end by squeezing and was placed in an iron tube. The procedures were performed in an inert atmosphere and then annealing was applied in a furnace at T 1160 C (in an Ar flow to minimize possible product oxidation) for 40 hours. The samples (which were a conglomerate of nearly 10 mm plates) () were taken off after breaking the tantalum tube.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"SmO 0:7 F 0:3 FeAs\"], \"tcs\": [\"54.6-K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: SmO 0:7 F 0:3 FeAs, tc: 54.6-K\n"}]}

Consequently, the majority of carriers in such systems (as in HTSC cuprates) are holes, which distinguishes these systems from oxyarsenides, for which S < 0 [176].  The influence of the type of hole dopants (potassium or cesium) on the magnitude of the critical field in superconducting samples with similar compositions, Sr 0:6 K 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 and Sr 0:6 Cs 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 , was considered in [41]. Interesting experiments [79] on single-crystal BaFe 2 As 2 and Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 samples were carried out to study the anisotropy of the thermodynamic and electromagnetic prop- erties of these layered phases.   In particular, the room- temperature magnetic susceptibility w turns out to be close to isotropic, but in the region of decreased temperatures (T < 85 K), its anisotropy was clearly pronounced: w jjc < w cc .For superconducting Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 , the mea- sured anisotropy coefficient of the upper critical field g H cc =H jjc , measured in [79], ranges from 2.5 to 3.5. Studies of the effect of external pressure on the properties of 122 phases have begun [271 \u00b1 273]. For a superconducting single-crystal Ba 1\u00c0x K x Fe 2 As 2 sample, it was found that T c linearly decreases as the pressure increases [271].   Conversely, for nonsuperconducting CaFe 2 As 2 , a transition to the super- conducting state (with the critical temperature below T c $ 12 K) was revealed [272, 273].In recent paper [274], systematic studies of the pressure effect on the properties of undoped CaFe 2 As 2 , SrFe 2 As 2 , and BaFe 2 As 2 have been performed and their superconducting transition (Fig. 17b) was found.  In the series CaFe 2 As 2 3 SrFe 2 As 2 3 BaFe 2 As 2 , the superconducting transition region is shifted towards higher pressures, and the pressure-induced T c value increases from $ 12 K for CaFe 2 As 2 to $ 29 K for BaFe 2 As 2 . The latter value (DT c $ 29 K) is the maximum ever obtained with the application of external pressure to superconductors [274].   The parameters of superconducting states of hole-doped 122 phases were discussed on the basis of optical spectroscopy data for Ba 0:6 K 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 [275] and Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 [276] and scanning tunnel microscopy for Sr 1\u00c0x K x Fe 2 As 2 [277].  Some experiments were conducted to study the relation between the structural and magnetic characteristics of AFe 2 As 2 phases.From the optical spectroscopy data for SrFe 2 As 2 and EuFe 2 As 2 [270], a conclusion was drawn that these systems exhibit a spin instability and a pseudogap can be formed in their spectrum due to spin density waves.  Accord- ing to the data of NGR spectroscopy for 57 Fe nuclei, obtained for BaFe 2 As 2 at T 298, 77, and 4.2 K [38], a long-range magnetic order exists in this crystal at T 4 77 K.The experimental results with the use of neutron diffraction on BaFe 2 As 2 [268] and CaFe 2 As 2 [278] have allowed assuming that their low-temperature (orthorhombic) phases involve a structure formed by magnetic moments of Fe atoms (Fig. 18a).Additional information on the magnetic charac- teristics of 122 phases was obtained using NMR [279, 280], mRS, and NGR spectroscopy [281].In conclusion, we mention some interesting experimen- tal studies of the electronic properties and topology of the FS of 122 phases using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.From these data, the authors of [282, 283] reconstructed the AFe 2 As 2 FS reflecting the quasi-two- dimensional electronic structure of 122 phases and includ- ing hole cylinders in the center of the BZ and electron sheets at its edges, which agrees well with the band calculations [284] (Fig. 18b).The same method was used to analyze the FS evolution and to discuss the origin of the superconducting pseudogap under potassium doping of BaFe 2 As 2 [285 \u00b1 287].It was found in [285] that in Ba 1\u00c0x K x Fe 2 As 2 (as compared to the original BaFe 2 As 2 ), the radius of the hole cylinders (centered at the G point of\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"CaFe 2 As 2\", \"CaFe 2 As 2\", \"BaFe 2 As 2\"], \"tcs\": [\"12 K\", \"12 K\", \"29 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: CaFe 2 As 2, tc: 12 K\n  - material: CaFe 2 As 2, tc: 12 K\n  - material: BaFe 2 As 2, tc: 29 K\n"}]}

Some experiments were conducted to study the relation between the structural and magnetic characteristics of AFe 2 As 2 phases.From the optical spectroscopy data for SrFe 2 As 2 and EuFe 2 As 2 [270], a conclusion was drawn that these systems exhibit a spin instability and a pseudogap can be formed in their spectrum due to spin density waves.  Accord- ing to the data of NGR spectroscopy for 57 Fe nuclei, obtained for BaFe 2 As 2 at T 298, 77, and 4.2 K [38], a long-range magnetic order exists in this crystal at T 4 77 K.The experimental results with the use of neutron diffraction on BaFe 2 As 2 [268] and CaFe 2 As 2 [278] have allowed assuming that their low-temperature (orthorhombic) phases involve a structure formed by magnetic moments of Fe atoms (Fig. 18a).Additional information on the magnetic charac- teristics of 122 phases was obtained using NMR [279, 280], mRS, and NGR spectroscopy [281].In conclusion, we mention some interesting experimen- tal studies of the electronic properties and topology of the FS of 122 phases using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.From these data, the authors of [282, 283] reconstructed the AFe 2 As 2 FS reflecting the quasi-two- dimensional electronic structure of 122 phases and includ- ing hole cylinders in the center of the BZ and electron sheets at its edges, which agrees well with the band calculations [284] (Fig. 18b).The same method was used to analyze the FS evolution and to discuss the origin of the superconducting pseudogap under potassium doping of BaFe 2 As 2 [285 \u00b1 287].It was found in [285] that in Ba 1\u00c0x K x Fe 2 As 2 (as compared to the original BaFe 2 As 2 ), the radius of the hole cylinders (centered at the G point of\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"CaFe 2 As 2\", \"BaFe 2 As 2\", \"CaFe 2 As 2\"], \"tcs\": [\"12 K\", \"12 K\", \"29 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: CaFe 2 As 2, tc: 12 K\n  - material: CaFe 2 As 2, tc: 12 K\n  - material: BaFe 2 As 2, tc: 29 K\n"}]}

Consequently, the majority of carriers in such systems (as in HTSC cuprates) are holes, which distinguishes these systems from oxyarsenides, for which S < 0 [176].  The influence of the type of hole dopants (potassium or cesium) on the magnitude of the critical field in superconducting samples with similar compositions, Sr 0:6 K 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 and Sr 0:6 Cs 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 , was considered in [41]. Interesting experiments [79] on single-crystal BaFe 2 As 2 and Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 samples were carried out to study the anisotropy of the thermodynamic and electromagnetic prop- erties of these layered phases.   In particular, the room- temperature magnetic susceptibility w turns out to be close to isotropic, but in the region of decreased temperatures (T < 85 K), its anisotropy was clearly pronounced: w jjc < w cc .For superconducting Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 , the mea- sured anisotropy coefficient of the upper critical field g H cc =H jjc , measured in [79], ranges from 2.5 to 3.5. Studies of the effect of external pressure on the properties of 122 phases have begun [271 \u00b1 273]. For a superconducting single-crystal Ba 1\u00c0x K x Fe 2 As 2 sample, it was found that T c linearly decreases as the pressure increases [271].   Conversely, for nonsuperconducting CaFe 2 As 2 , a transition to the super- conducting state (with the critical temperature below T c $ 12 K) was revealed [272, 273].In recent paper [274], systematic studies of the pressure effect on the properties of undoped CaFe 2 As 2 , SrFe 2 As 2 , and BaFe 2 As 2 have been performed and their superconducting transition (Fig. 17b) was found.  In the series CaFe 2 As 2 3 SrFe 2 As 2 3 BaFe 2 As 2 , the superconducting transition region is shifted towards higher pressures, and the pressure-induced T c value increases from $ 12 K for CaFe 2 As 2 to $ 29 K for BaFe 2 As 2 . The latter value (DT c $ 29 K) is the maximum ever obtained with the application of external pressure to superconductors [274].   The parameters of superconducting states of hole-doped 122 phases were discussed on the basis of optical spectroscopy data for Ba 0:6 K 0:4 Fe 2 As 2 [275] and Ba 0:55 K 0:45 Fe 2 As 2 [276] and scanning tunnel microscopy for Sr 1\u00c0x K x Fe 2 As 2 [277].

The remarkable thing is that T c is strongly reflected in interlayer distance rather than in-plane one.  Indeed, the enhancement of T c in LSCO, which reaches 51.6 K at 8 GPa, is mainly inter- preted in terms of interlayer expansion, which enhances two dimensionality. Therefore, we expect that measure- ment under anisotropy controlled pressures causes much higher T c than previously reported values for many high- T c materials.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"LSCO\"], \"tcs\": [\"51.6 K\"], \"pressures\": [\"8 GPa\"], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: LSCO, tc: 51.6 K, pressure: 8 GPa\n"}]}

The NMR experiments were carried out using a standard phase coherent type pulse spectrometer. 59 Co NMR spectra were obtained by recording the spin-echo intensity with the applied magnetic field changed step by step in a magnetic field range of 1-2 T. Measurements were carried out on two kinds of samples of Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O, randomly oriented and aligned samples.

The directions of the principal axes of Knight shift are assumed to be same as those of the electric quadrupole interaction. In the present case, the z-axis was defined along the direction, for which the component of the electric quadrupole tensor, \u03bd zz is larger than the other components. This z direction was found to be along the c-axis by fitting the positions of calculated spectra to those of aligned sample. The fitted result for the data taken at 5 K in the magnetic field H within the ab plane of Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O is shown in (b) and the parameters determined by the fitting are, K x = ~3.5\u00b10.1 %, K y = ~3.1\u00b10.05 %, the electric quadrupole resonance frequency \u03bd Q =3.6\u00b10.05 MHz and the asymmetric parameter of the electric field gradient at nuclei \u03b7=0.28\u00b10.02.

The comparison of the values of \u03bd Q and \u03b7 of the aligned sample with those of the randomly oriented one justifies the present assignment of the z direction along the c axis. shows the T dependence of the 59 Co-NMR spectra around the peak of central line for the randomly oriented powder sample. The H value of the peak position is nearly T-independent above T c (~4.5 K) and then increases with decreasing T below T c .  This change of the peak position is due to the T dependence of the Knight shift K y and not due to the second order effect of the electrical quadrupole interaction, because \u03bd Q and \u03b7 are T-independent, as was confirmed by analyzing the spectra in the H region between 0.8-2.4 T at 2.9 K, 4.7 K and 6.2 K.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Na x CoO 2 \\u22c5yH 2 O\"], \"tcs\": [\"~4.5 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O, tc: ~4.5 K\n"}]}

The arrow in indicates the structural phase transition tem- perature T LT of La 1.84 Y 0.04 Sr 0.12 CuO 4 . As decreasing temperature in 4T, R H of LYSCO shows the drastic decrease below the vicinity of T LT and the sign reversal occurs in the low temperature region from 25 K to 15 K.In the orthorhombic LSCO, only the gradual decrease in R H is observed below 50 K which is far above T c =27 K, but no sign reversal is detected. These experimental results seem to be commonplace, since the anomalous change of R H is observed in the TLT phase but not in the OMT phase and R H in the TLT phase goes to zero in low temperatures as expected in the simplified stripe model .  In 9 T, however, the sign reversal of R H in low temperatures is enhanced.In LYSCO, the temperature range where the sign is negative spreads and the absolute value at minimum point becomes larger, though the temperature where R H begins to fall is not changed in 9 T.Surprisingly in the orthorhombic LSCO, the sign reversal does appear below 20 K though no change of the sign is observed in 4 T.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"orthorhombic LSCO\"], \"tcs\": [\"27 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: orthorhombic LSCO, tc: 27 K\n"}]}

We have shown that our crystal field parameters agree very well with those obtained by previous authors using the completely differ- ent method of high field ESR on powdered samples. Our results also support the conclusions of the same work which found that isolated oxygens in vacant chains do not influence the CF configuration around the magnetic ion and therefore cannot be distinguished from a vacant chain via ESR spectroscopy. This is in accord with the fact that isolated oxygens do not promote holes from the copper-oxygen planes. The principal result of this work is a set of new values for the penetration depth in all three crystal- lographic directions for three oxygen-ordered phases of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+y which are summarized in Table .

The lattice parameters a and c are 2.8245 and 19.7101 \u00c5, respectively. The uniform magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 was measured using a SQUID magnetometer with magnetic fields H= 5 Oe and 1 T.  The data for H= 5 Oe are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of T, where the onset of the superconductivity is found at T ~4.5 K.  The magnitudes of diamagnetic signals taken at T =2.0 K under the conditions of zero-field cooling and field cooling correspond to the volume fractions of ~24% and ~6%, respectively.These values are rather large for the powder sample with two-dimensional nature and therefore exclude the possibility that the superconductivity is filamentary. The T 1 of Co nuclei was measured by detecting nuclear magnetization after applying an inversion pulse in the frequency region around 3\u03bd Q (the 5/2\u21927/2 transition), \u03bd Q being the electrical quadrupolar frequency (~4.2 MHz at 4.23 K). This value of \u03bd Q is consistent with the one estimated from the 59 Co NMR spectra of this sample. The nuclear magnetization m measured as a function of time t elapsed after the inversion pulse, was analyzed under the assumption that there exist two components with shorter and longer relaxation times, T 1short and T 1long , respectively. The following theoretical equation with the number fraction c of nuclear spins which have a shorter relaxation time T 1short , was used. A typical example of the fittings to the observed m-t curves is shown in the inset of Fig. . The c values are found to be ~(0.96-0.98). T 1long is of the order of 1 s and the origin of this longer relaxation time may be due to the existence of a small amount of impurity phase(s). Because T 1short is smaller than T 1long /10 even in the lowest temperature region, both kinds of T 1 can be reliably estimated. Hereafter, T 1 denotes the relaxation time T 1short corresponding to the main phase.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Na x CoO 2 \\u22c5yH 2 O\"], \"tcs\": [\"~4.5 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"magnetic susceptibility\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Na x CoO 2 \u22c5yH 2 O, tc: ~4.5 K, me_methods: magnetic susceptibility\n"}]}

The pyrochlore has a general formula of A 2 B 2 O 7 , consisting of BO 6 octahedra and eightfold coordinated A cations, where A and B are transition metals and/or rare-earth elements.  In particular, the B sublattice can be viewed as a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra, providing a testing ground for studying the role of geometrical frustration in sys- tems which have local spins at B sites with antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation.Such systems are known to remain frustrated even when the exchange interaction is ferromagnetic (FM), provided that the spin correlation has local Ising anisotropy. Recent studies have revealed a rich variety of phenomena seemingly related to the geometrical frustration, such as the occurrence of a spin-glass (SG) phase in R 2 Mo 2 O 7 with R=Y, Tb and Dy , the unusual behavior of ordinary and anomalous Hall coefficients in the same compound with R=Nd, Sm and Gd , and the \"spin-ice\" phase in R 2 Ti 2 O 7 with R=Dy and Ho. Although metallic pyrochlores comprise a minority subgroup of the pyrochlore family, they consist of distinct members such as Tl 2 Mn 2 O 7 , which exhibits colossal magnetoresis- tance.   Moreover, the recently revealed superconductivity in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 , a 5d transition metal pyrochlore , demonstrates that the pyrochlores provide a fertile field for elec- tronic correlation adjacent to the perovskite compounds.   In this context, it is noteworthy that LiV 2 O 4 , a cubic spinel compound in which the V sublattice is isostructural to the B sublattice in pyrochlore, behaves similarly to a heavy fermion metal. It is reported that Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 falls into the bulk superconducting state below T c \u2243 1 \u223c 2 K, as confirmed by a large jump of specific heat \u2206C c as well as large diamagnetism due to the Meissner effect associated with the occurrence of zero resistivity.   The dc magnetization curve indicates that the superconductivity is of type II with the upper critical field close to 0.29 T at 0 K.The ratio \u2206C c /\u03b3T c (with \u03b3 being the Sommerfeld constant) is reported to be 1.15, which is smaller than the predicted value of 1.43 for isotropic BCS superconductors.Unfortunately, these measurements were performed only above 0.4 K and are thus inconclusive in determining the detailed characteristics of superconductivity in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 .In this Letter, we report on the quasiparticle excitations in the mixed state of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 studied by muon spin rotation/relaxation (\u00b5SR).The magnetic penetration depth \u03bb, which reflects the population of normal electrons (\"quasiparticles\") in the superconductive state, is determined microscopically by measuring the muon spin relaxation due to the spatial inhomogeneity of magnetic induction in the flux line lattice (FLL).We show that the temperature dependence of \u03bb is more or less consistent with the prediction based on the BCS superconductors with an isotropic gap, although a slight discrepancy is suggested by the detailed analysis.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Cd 2 Re 2 O 7\"], \"tcs\": [\"1 \\u223c 2 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"specific heat\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Cd 2 Re 2 O 7, tc: 1 \u223c 2 K, me_methods: specific heat\n"}]}

Highly pure Li 2 CO 3 and TiO 2 were mixed in an appropriate ratio, calcined in a quartz tube under pure oxygen atmosphere for 20 h at 750 0 C leading to the formation of Li 2 Ti 2 O 5 . Then it was mixed with a proper amount of Ti 2 O 3 , grounded thoroughly, pressed into pellets, and sintered at 880 0 C for 24 h under a dynamic vacuum with pressure less than 10 -4 torr. Basically, to obtain a pure LiTi 2 O 4 phase, one needs to add ~15% more of Li than nominal composition due to its volatility. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) data obtained by SIEMENS D5000 diffractometer using CuK\u03b1 radiation showed that Li 1+x Ti 2 O 4 exhibited Ti 2 O 3 impurity phase for x=0 and pure LiTi 2 O 4 phase was obtained for 0.1 \u2264 x \u2264 0.15 (Ref. ) which was used for this specific heat measurement.

Magnetiza- tion measurements showed a single sharp superconduct- ing transition at T c \u2243 43 K and the saturation of the sus- ceptibility at low temperatures indicating the good sam- ple quality.   The \u00b5SR measurements were performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Switzerland) using low- momentum muons (29 MeV/c). A detailed discussion of the TF-\u00b5SR technique is given in where details of the application of the technique to the determination of \u03bb can be found. shows TF-\u00b5SR muon-spin precession signals in an applied field of 600 mT above and below T c .For vi- sualization purposes the apparent precession frequencies are modified from the actual precession frequencies by the use of a rotating reference frame.  In the normal state above T c , the oscillation shows a small relaxation due to random local fields from nuclear magnetic moments. Below T c , the relaxation rate strongly increases due to the inhomogeneous field distribution of the flux line lat- tice. It is well known that in n-type cuprates there is a competition between the antiferromagnetically ordered state and superconductivity . The static magnetism, if present, could enhance the muon depolarization rate and falsify the interpretation of the TF-\u00b5SR results.   We have therefore carried out zero-field (ZF) \u00b5SR experi- ments to determine whether such static magnetism exists in SLCO.Typical ZF-\u00b5SR spectra are shown in for temperatures above and below T c . The ZF relaxation is exponential with a small relaxation rate 0.149(4) \u00b5s \u22121 and 0.184(5) \u00b5s \u22121 at 50 and 2.5 K, respectively. Thus, there is no evidence for the static magnetism in SLCO down to 2.5 K.Moreover, the ZF relaxation rate is small and changes very little between 50 and 2.5 K.Therefore, the increase in TF relaxation rate below T c is attributed entirely to the vortex lattice.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 (SLCO)\"], \"tcs\": [\"43 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"Magnetiza- tion\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 (SLCO), tc: 43 K, me_methods: Magnetiza- tion\n"}]}

The HPO annealing was carried out in a cubic-anvil-type ultra-high-pressure apparatus at 5 GPa and 500 o C for 30 min. As an oxygen source, Ag 2 O 2 (that readily releases O 2 upon heating while decomposing via Ag 2 O to Ag) was utilized: Ag 2 O 2 was mixed with Co-1212 powder to a molar ratio of 1 : 2. XRD patterns for the HPO samples are shown in . Comparison with those for the AS samples (reveals that the HPO annealing had no effect on the phase purity of the samples. On the other hand, in where the lattice parameters are plotted for both the AS and the HPO samples, it is observed that upon HPO annealing the lattice drastically shrank along the b and c axes, whereas the a-axis parameter remained unchanged. As a consequence of the b-axis shrinkage, the degree of orthorhombic distortion decreases. We recognize the same from the fact that every pair of double peaks seen in the XRD pattern for the AS samples, e.g. 026 and 206, 136 and 316, 138 and 318, merges into a single peak after HPO annealings. This suggests that the CoO 4 tetrahedra have got broken as a consequence of the change in the oxygen amount/arrangement about the Co atom. For the HPO-annealed samples superconductivity appears with the transition temperature (T c ) up to 40 K (as determined at the onset of the diamagnetic signal) for the x = 0.3 sample.   The largest volume fraction of superconductivity (16 % from the ZFC data and 11 % from the FC data) is due to the x = 0.35 sample. In , we show the T c values for all the HPO samples as plotted against x.A bell-shape relation is seen.   In we have shown the \u03c7 vs. T curve for the x = 0.4 sample as an example.Now a question arises on the primary reason for the appearance of superconductivity in the HPO samples. To be able to reach the correct answer, we first investigated whether the pure high-pressure (HP) effect alone would induce superconductivity in the Ca-substituted CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 samples.As-synthesized powder with x = 0.4 was annealed without Ag 2 O 2 at 5 GPa and 500 o C for 30 min, i.e. under the condition otherwise the same as that employed for the HPO samples except that no excess oxygen source was added.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"x = 0.3\"], \"tcs\": [\"up to 40 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"diamagnetic signal\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: x = 0.3, tc: up to 40 K, me_methods: diamagnetic signal\n"}]}

On the other hand, the amount of Ag seen in the XRD pattern did not visibly increase as compared to that seen for the HPO sample. Therefore, it is likely that the weight/oxygen loss detected by TG upon N 2 annealing is primarily due to the Co-1212 phase itself.  This conclusion is supported by the magnetization data: upon annealing the HPO sample in N 2 not only superconductivity but also the magnetic transition characteristically seen for all the HPO samples around 150 K disappeared ). Note that the origin of the magnetic transition (manifested by the branching of the ZFC and FC magnetization curves) was left unaddressed yet, as the structure of the CoO 1+\u03b4 charge reservoir is not determined for the HPO samples. The second, smaller weight step in the TG curve about 300 o C well coincides with that seen for the decomposition of pure Ag 2 O .

More importantly, the sample did not show superconductivity.  On the other hand, with 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2 peaks due to Ag 2 O appeared in the XRD pattern for the HPO annealed sample. The annealed sample exhibited superconductivity with a lower T c value of 20 K than that of the HPO annealed product with 50 mol-% of Ag 2 O 2 (T c \u2248 35 K). It was thus revealed that the optimum amount of Ag 2 O 2 as an oxygen source for the HPO annealing is in the vicinity of 50 mol-%. Here it should also be noted that we annealed the two new HPO samples in a thermobalance in N 2 .   From the TG curves shown in Fig. together with that for the sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 we could see the following features: the second weight-loss step about 300 o C that we had previously assigned to the decomposition of leftover Ag 2 O was not seen at all for the HPO sample with 25 % Ag 2 O 2 (y \u2248 0), whereas it was more pronounced for that with 100 % Ag 2 O 2 (y \u2248 1.0) in comparison with the original HPO sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 (y \u2248 0.4). The amount of oxygen depleted from the Co-1212 phase in the first weight-loss step increased with increasing amount of Ag 2 O 2 used for the HPO annealing, i.e.  In conclusion, we have systematically clarified the influence of aliovalent Ca II -for-Y III substitution and high-pressure-oxygen annealing on the superconductivity of CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 (Co-1212) samples.

The annealed sample exhibited superconductivity with a lower T c value of 20 K than that of the HPO annealed product with 50 mol-% of Ag 2 O 2 (T c \u2248 35 K). It was thus revealed that the optimum amount of Ag 2 O 2 as an oxygen source for the HPO annealing is in the vicinity of 50 mol-%. Here it should also be noted that we annealed the two new HPO samples in a thermobalance in N 2 .   From the TG curves shown in Fig. together with that for the sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 we could see the following features: the second weight-loss step about 300 o C that we had previously assigned to the decomposition of leftover Ag 2 O was not seen at all for the HPO sample with 25 % Ag 2 O 2 (y \u2248 0), whereas it was more pronounced for that with 100 % Ag 2 O 2 (y \u2248 1.0) in comparison with the original HPO sample with 50 % Ag 2 O 2 (y \u2248 0.4). The amount of oxygen depleted from the Co-1212 phase in the first weight-loss step increased with increasing amount of Ag 2 O 2 used for the HPO annealing, i.e.  In conclusion, we have systematically clarified the influence of aliovalent Ca II -for-Y III substitution and high-pressure-oxygen annealing on the superconductivity of CoSr 2 (Y 1-x Ca x )Cu 2 O 7+\u03b4 (Co-1212) samples. It was found that at least up to x \u2248 0.4 Ca dissolves in the Co-1212 phase at the Y site.Within this range of Ca substitution the oxygen content of as-synthesized samples remained stoichiometric. Therefore we could assure that holes were gradually doped in the Co-1212 structure upon Ca substitution.The as-synthesized samples, however, were not superconductive, suggesting that the holes created by the divalent-for-trivalent substitution are trapped about the Co atom in the charge reservoir.The combination of Ca substitution and high-pressure-oxygen annealing was necessary to induce superconductivity in the Co-1212 phase.The highest T c obtained in the present study for the HPO-annealed x = 0.3 sample was \u223c40 K.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"x = 0.4 sample using 25 and 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2\", \"x = 0.4 sample using 25 and 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2\", \"x = 0.3\"], \"tcs\": [\"35 K\", \"20 K\", \"\\u223c40 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: x = 0.4 sample using 25 and 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2, tc: 20 K\n  - material: x = 0.4 sample using 25 and 100 mol-% Ag 2 O 2, tc: 35 K\n  - material: x = 0.3, tc: \u223c40 K\n"}]}

In this way, the magnetic field and the current effects on the electrical resistivity and the diamagnetic signal strongly suggest that the anomalous behavior in the electrical resistivity below 20 K is attributed to a pressure-induced superconductivity.The broadening of the superconducting transition below ~20 K is probably due to a sample inhomogeneity rather than a distribution of pressure, because a hydrostatic condition was kept unchanged during the measurements.     The pressure-induced superconductivity have also been reported in Fe-As compounds having a ThCr 2 Si 2 -type tetragonal structure. The anomaly due to the pressure-induced superconductivity is also detected by the electrical resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 29 GPa using the DAC, as shown in . In this measurement, the zero resistivity was not observed even in the highest pressure.The failure to observe the zero resistivity is probably caused by a nonhydrostatic compressive stress resulting from the use of a solid pressure-transmitting medium. We confirmed current dependence of the electrical resistivity below the transition temperature.  The transition temperature increases by applying pressure to a maximum of 21 K, and decreases monotonically above 16 GPa.(a) shows the pressure dependence of the characteristic temperature T 0 and the superconducting transition temperature T c . The T 0 monotonically decreases with increasing pressure.On the other hand, the T c increases to the maximum of 21 K at ~12 GPa, then deceases with further applying pressure.This P-T phase diagram shown in is similar to x-T phase diagram for the F -substituted system, LaFeAsO 1-x F x . 1) In addition, the pressure dependence of T c in LaFeAsO is similar to those observed in the F-doped compounds, as shown in .The substitution effect of O 2-by F -in LaFeAsO is expected to lead shrinkage of lattice constants and change of carrier density, resulting in suppression of structural and magnetic phase transitions and enhancement of T c.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"], \"tcs\": [\"below 20 K\", \"below ~20 K\", \"below ~20 K\", \"21 K\"], \"pressures\": [\"9 and 12 GPa\", \"12 GPa\"], \"me_methods\": [\"AC magnetic susceptibility\", \"electrical resistivity\", \"electrical resistivity\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - tc: below ~20 K, pressure: 9 and 12 GPa, me_methods: AC magnetic susceptibility\n  - tc: below 20 K, me_methods: electrical resistivity\n  - tc: below ~20 K, me_methods: electrical resistivity\n  - tc: 21 K, pressure: 12 GPa\n"}]}

Two main re- markable changes are clearly seen; one is a rela- tively abrupt increase in the oscillator strength at \u223c 200 K, common to all the peaks and the other is a sharp jump in the strength of the Goldstone modes, \u03c9 GL and \u03c9 GH , at their respective super- conducting T c , one at 16 K and the other at 30 K.  The increase in the oscillator strength of the collective modes at 200 K, indicates that the long- range order of the Wigner lattice starts to develop as evidenced by the reduction in their dynamic mass. At the same time, the strength increase in the Coulomb band suggests that more carri- ers occupy the Coulomb band following the de- velopment of the long-range order of the Wigner lattice.The corresponding free-carrier oscillator strength changes from \u223c 0.42 % at 300 K to \u223c 0.97 % at 150 K and to \u223c 1.18 % at 30 K in \u03b4 = 0.024 sample indicates that all the available free carriers are now occupying the Coulomb band and participating in the charge transport at T below 200 K.  However, we do not observe the change in the free carrier plasma frequency because of the increasing static dielectric constant with de- creasing T. In \u03b4 = 0.032 sample, the free carrier strength is \u223c 0.44 % of the total carrier at 300 K and \u223c 0.71 % at 30 K. At the same time, as demonstrated above, at the crossover tempera- ture (T 0 \u223c 200 K) of the long-range order of the Wigner lattice, the free carriers in the Coulomb band start to form pairs. Subtle changes in the d\u03c1/dT vs. T curves of both \u03b4 = 0.024 and \u03b4 = 0.032 samples at \u223c 200K has already been pointed out (see ).

It is surprising therefore to find superconductivity (SC) with T c = 43 K in the optimal electron-doped infinite-layer cuprates Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 (M = La, Gd), which exhibit only a 16% difference between the a and c tetragonal lattice parameters.   The structure of Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 is the most basic among all high-T c cuprates, consisting entirely of CuO 2 sheets separated by rare-earth (RE) ions with tetragonal lattice parameters c = 3.41\u00c5 and a = 3.95\u00c5. The recent success in producing high-quality polycrystalline samples of the infinite-layer cuprates with no observable impurity phases has en- gendered a renewed interest in these compounds.X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy indicate electron dop- ing, and bulk SC has been verified by powdered mag- netization (M ) measurements and specific heat (C) measurements (data presented later in this work). Sev- eral recent studies of these high purity polycrystalline samples suggest three-dimensional (3D) superconductiv- ity in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 .   Scanning tunnel spectroscopy (STS) measurements indicate an unconventional but isotropic s-wave superconducting gap with no pseudogap at zero field.   The s-wave symmetry of the gap is also sup- ported by specific heat measurements and Cu-site substi- tution studies,although it may be contradicted by NMR measurements. Kim et al estimated the c-axis coherence length (\u03be c ) from a Hao-Clem analysis of the reversible magnetization of grain-aligned poly- crystal, and found that \u03be c exceeds the spacing between the CuO 2 planes, indicating 3D superconductivity.On the other hand, they also find significant anisotropy be-tween magnetic fields H \u2264 5 T oriented parallel and per- pendicular to the CuO 2 planes, with an anisotropy ratio \u03b3 = \u03be c /\u03be ab = H ab c2 /H c c2 = 9.3, which is larger than \u03b3 = 5 observed in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7\u2212\u03b4 although much smaller than \u03b3 = 55 observed in optimally doped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8\u2212\u03b4 . It is interesting to note that the only ma- jor crystallographic difference between the a-b and the c directions in Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 is the presence of oxygen in the a-b plane, which allows coupling of adjacent Cu spins and has been implicated as the cause of antiferro- magntic ordering or spin fluctuations in other members of the high-T c cuprate family, as well as a possible mech- anism for superconducting pairing.The importance of the CuO 2 planes to the SC in Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 is further supported by the fact that Ni substitution on the Cu site rapidly suppresses T c whereas out-of-plane Gd substitu- tion on the Sr site leaves T c unchanged.In this work we determine the upper critical field H c2 and the irreversibility field H irr of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 by means of magnetization and penetration depth measure- ments in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T in order to directly investigate the degree of upper critical field anisotropy and the role of vortex fluctuations.We also present specific heat (C) and magnetization (M ) mea- surements in low DC fields to 6 T as a function of tem- perature (T ) of Sr 0.9 Gd 0.1 CuO 2, confirming the bulk co- existence of Gd paramagnetism (PM) and SC.Our re- sults suggest strong confinement of the spin pairing wave function to the CuO 2 planes and significant field-induced superconducting fluctuations.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 (M = La, Gd)\"], \"tcs\": [\"43 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Sr 0.9 M 0.1 CuO 2 (M = La, Gd), tc: 43 K\n"}]}

There is a large separation between H ab c2 and the irre- versibility field H ab irr , which extends down to T \u2192 0, and is abnormal for electron doped high-T c cuprates.

Note the negative \u03b8 obtained which is consistent with an AFM order. For R=Tb and Dy, the \u03c7(T) curves have a PM-like behavior down to 5 K.  For R= Dy, the small contribution of the Mo AFM signal, (0.2 emu/mol Oe for R=Y see Fig. 5 inset), is probably masked by the high PM susceptibility of Dy 3+ . The P eff value obtained fits well the expected value of Dy 3 .  For R=Tb, P eff = 8.7 \u00b5 B deduced, is smaller than the 9.72 \u00b5 B expected for free ion Tb 3+ , suggesting that Tb has an intermediate valence-state, which also affects its magnetic behavior.This is reminiscent of the exception of the non-SC Tb123, among all other R123 materials.  (D) The MoSr 2 Gd 1.5 Ce 0.5 Cu 2 O 10 sample.  This sample shows two magnetic transitions at 11 K and at 184 K and positive \u03b8 (Fig. 4). The M(H) curves are linear and no hystersis is observed. At 5 K, for H> 3 T a tendency toward PM saturation (of Gd ions) is obtained. No magnetic transition is observed down to 1.8 K (Fig 4 inset).This is in contrast to Gd123, M-1212 (M=Ru and Mo) and Ru-1222 in which Gd is AFM ordered at 2.2-2.6 K.  (I) We may suggest that the peak at 11 K is related to the Gd sublattice and the highest transition i s due to the Mo layers. (II) A more preferable interpretation is that both transitions are related to the Mo sublattice, whereas the origin of the second one is not known yet.  Our supporting evidence is the fact, that in MoSr 2 GdCeCu 2 O 10 (Gd/Ce=1) both anomalies are absent (Fig. 4), suggesting that the two magnetic transitions are connected to each other. The PM values extracted for MoSr 2 GdCeCu 2 O 10 are:\u03b8= -4.4 K and P eff = 7.85 \u00b5 B /Gd which fits well the theoretical value of 7.94 \u00b5 B /Gd. At the present moment we cannot explain as to why the R=Gd sample behaves so differently from all the rest of the heavy Mo-1222R compounds. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the behavior of Mo-1222 system is entirely different from Ru 5+ -1222 one.In Mo-1222 (Mo 5+ ), the physical state depends strongly on the ionic radii of the R ionst.  For large R ions, the samples are PM ). Once the a lattice parameter is contracted, SC in the CuO 2 planes is induced at T C ~ 20 K. Further contraction of a leads to an AFM order (at T N 13-26 K) in the Mo-O layers and to suppression of SC.The SC and AFM (which compete each other) states depend on the R/Ce ratio and both disappear for R/Ce=1.The magnetic behavior of the Gd sample is different.Neutron diffraction as well as MS on 155 Gd studies, are now being carried out to determine the magnetic structure of this system.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Mo-1222 (Mo 5+ )\"], \"tcs\": [\"20 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Mo-1222 (Mo 5+ ), tc: 20 K\n"}]}

To our knowledge this was so far the first case that a p-type cuprate superconductor shows the Cu-O-Cu distance in the [CuO2] plane larger than 3.90 \u00c5. It is once more an indication of the uniqueness of oxyhalide superconductors in comparing with the pure copper oxide HTS. Some compounds with the same 0201-type or similar structure (1201-type) exhibited insulating properties , which have larger a-axis than 3.90\u00c5 and contained large oxygen vacancy (20-75%) in the [CuO2] plane, resulting in the imperfect [CuO2] layers.  In contrast, the Rietveld refinements shown in suggests that the 0201-type Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y contained few oxygen vacancies, indicating that the [CuO2] sheet is rather perfect. So in order to induce superconductivity in the Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y samples, the key point is how to dope appropriate amount of mobile carriers into the [CuO2] sheets which should be perfect and keep the chemical stoichiometry.In addition, the energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis revealed that the average atomic ratio of Sr:Cu:Cl over tens of well grown grains was basically in agreement with the suggested Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl y formula.  At the same time, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction investigation on a large amount of crystals of the samples did not show the trace of other phases with the similar K 2 NiF 4 structure .So it is inferred that the observed 30 K bulk superconductiv- ity is caused by the apical oxygen doped Cl-0201 phase Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"oxygen doped Cl-0201 phase Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y\"], \"tcs\": [\"30 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: oxygen doped Cl-0201 phase Sr 2 CuO 2+ Cl 2-y, tc: 30 K\n"}]}

This led him in 1911 to his famous experiment to see how low one can go concerning electrical resistance. The observed sudden jump to apparently zero resistivity below 4 K came nevertheless as a big surprise. Kamerlingh Onnes immediately recognized it as indication of a new state of matter. In 1933, the discovery of Walter Mei\u00dfner and Robert Ochsenfeld that magnetic fields are expelled from a superconductor, demonstrated that superconductivity is actually a true thermodynamical state since in contrast to the situation for a merely perfect conductor this expulsion is independent of the experimental history .\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"Mercury\"], \"tcs\": [\"below 4 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": [\"electrical resistance\"]}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: Mercury, tc: below 4 K, me_methods: electrical resistance\n"}]}

Matthias and John K. Hulm started in the early 1950s a extensive systematic search that delivered a number of new compounds with high T c well above 10 K as well as technically attractive B c2 well above 10 T. The most prominent examples of this crop were NbTi (T c = 9.2 K) and the A15 materials, A 3 B type intermetallic compounds, the materials basis for todays SC wire industry.    Having generated some 3000 different alloys in the 1950s and 1960s Matthias became a recognized wizard of the SC materials science.He condensed his huge practical knowledge into \"rules\" of how to prepare \"good\" superconductors: High crystal symmetry, high density of electronic states at the Fermi level, no oxygen, no magnetism, no insulators! In spite of his inofficial sixth rule \"Stay away from theorists!\", in 1957 the BCS theory brought up a desperately awaited breakthrough of theoretical solid state physics, a microscopic explanation of superconductivity. Due to the atomic bomb development, single isotope SC samples, e.g., mercury, had become available where the dependence of T c on the isotope mass pointed to a phonon-driven mechanism. John Bardeen realized that phonons introduce an attractive interaction between electrons close to the Fermi surface (\"overscreening\").  The key idea of BCS theory is that even a tiny attractive interaction between these electrons leads to the formation of bound electron pair states (\"Cooper pairs\"). The electrons in these paired states are no longer obliged to obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, which enforces the electrons to occupy high kinetic energy single particle states due to the Pauli principle. The energy gain of the SC state with respect to the normal state does not result from the small binding energy of the pairs but it is the condensation energy of the pairs merging into a macroscopic quantum state.This results in an energy gap for electron excitations into single particle states. Although the BCS theory was derived from the physical idea of attractive electron-phonon coupling, the model-based weak pair coupling theory as its mathematical essence is well applicable to other pairing mechanisms.BCS theory had an impact not only on solid state physics but also on elementary particle physics where it was further developed to the idea of the Higgs mechanism of elementary particle mass generation (origins, impact and current state of the BCS theory are reviewed in ).\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"NbTi\"], \"tcs\": [\"9.2 K\"], \"pressures\": [], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - material: NbTi, tc: 9.2 K\n"}]}

The cuprate \"high- temperature superconductors\" (\"HTS\") discovered in 1986 proved that the limiting case d = 2+\u03b5 (\u03b5\u21920), i.e., a scenario of basically two-dimensional CuO layer-oriented superconductivity with slight SC coupling to neighbouring CuO layers, can even be enormously beneficial for SC long-range order (the evolution of HTS is reviewed in ). The problem with the theoretical description of cuprate HTS within BCS theory and its extensions is not the high T c of up to 138 K under normal pressure , far above the pre-HTS record of 23 K :    According to the McMillan-Rowell formula , a commonly used T c approximation for the BCS superconductors, this HTS T c range is readily accessible with reasonable materials parameters .The real problem is that, in contrast to the \"deep\" Fermi sea of quasi-free electrons in classical metals where the Cooper-pair condensed electrons amount only to a small part of the valence electron system (k B T c << E Fermi ), in these layered cuprate compounds there is only a \"shallow\" reservoir of charge carriers (k B T c ~ E Fermi ) which first have to be introduced in the insulating antiferromagnetic (\"AF\") stoichiometric parent compound by appropriate doping. Moreover, these charge carriers turn out to be complex physical objects in which strong Coulomb correlations connect their internal charge and spin degrees of freedom and for which Landau's quasiparticle concept of a description in terms of quasi-free electrons \"dressed\" by screening charge clouds no longer applies .  The normal charge transport based on these carriers corresponds to a \"bad/strange metal\" behaviour with a quite high electrical resistance which increases with temperature in a linear way without saturation up to the melting temperature, in stark contrast to the well-known saturating scattering behaviour of quasi-particles in a normal metal. Accordingly, the BCS recipe to express the SC wavefunction in terms of simple normal-metal single particle states does not work for cuprate HTS since the macroscopic many-particle wavefunction is thoroughly changing in the superconductive transition.Moreover, the strong connection of charge and spin degrees of freedom in the normal-conducting state paves the way for a plethora of other forms of broken symmetry, e.g. charge and spin density waves, which may compete or cooperate with superconductivity .A satisfactory theoretical description has not yet been achieved but the SC instability in cuprate HTS, as well as in the structurally and chemically related layered ruthenate and cobaltate compounds, is believed to stem predominantly from a magnetic and not from a phononic interaction as in the case of the classical metallic superconductors where magnetism plays only the role of an alternative, intrinsically antagonistic long range order instability.\n```\n\nFind the relations between lists of entities of different classes. \nApply strictly the following rules:  \n    - if material is not specified, ignore the relation block,\n    - if tc is not specified in absolute values, ignore the relation block \n    \nFollowing the lists of entities: \n{\"materials\": [\"\"], \"tcs\": [\"up to 138 K\"], \"pressures\": [\"normal pressure\"], \"me_methods\": []}\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "relations:\n  - tc: up to 138 K, pressure: normal pressure\n"}]}
