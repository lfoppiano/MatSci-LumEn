{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the users question. \nIf you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\n----------------\nThe effects of various constituents are now considered in relation to the specific examples and comparison examples. Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the influence on the tensile strength of Cr content. The tensile strength increases as the Cr quantity increases, when the Ni quantity is2.60 to 4.15%. Particularly, when Cr quantity exceeds 1.4%, the tensile strength increases rapidly so that the effect of Cr is large. If the quantity exceeds 2.0%, a high tensile strength over 100kg/mm2 can be obtained. Fig. 2 is a diagram showing the relationship with Ni/Cr ratio. The tensile strength decreases as Ni/Cr ratio increases. Particularly, a higher strength is obtained by setting the Ni/Cr ratio lower than 2.1. While related to Ni quantity, a far higher strength over 100kg/mm2 is obtained by securing a high Ni quantity over 3.50%. This is obtained by setting Ni/Cr ratio below 2.3 and Ni below 3.5% against the objective tensile strength of 93kg/mm2. In this case, if Ni is less than 3%, that tensile strength is difficult to obtain. Fig. 3 shows the relationship with Si quantity, indicating that the strength increases as the Si quantity increases. When Si quantity is more than 0.17%, 93kg/mm2 is obtained by adjusting Cr and Ni to 1.3 to 1.8% and 2.6 to 3.5% respectively, while if Cr exceeds 2%, when Si is as low as or less than 0.1%, more than 93kg/mm2 or particularly more than 100kg/mm2 is obtained. Fig. 4 is a diagram showing the influence on 50% fracture appearance transition temperature of Ni or Cr contents. As the content of Ni or Cr increases, FATT lowers, and particularly, when Si is less than 0.1%, FATT below 0\u00b0C is obtained by making more than 0.5% Cr contained. Fig. 5 is a diagram showing the influence on FATT of Si quantity. As Si quantity decreases, FATT decreases so as to secure a high toughness. Particularly, when Ni is 2.5 to 3.0% and Cr is 1.3 to 1.8%, FATT can be lowered below 0\u00b0C by adjusting Si quantity to below 0.08%, and when Ni is 3.5 to 4.0% and Cr is 1.5 to 2.2%, the value can be lowered below 0\u00b0C by adjusting Si quantity to below 0.13%. When Cr is over 2.2% and Ni is over 3.5%, FATT can be lowered below 0\u00b0C by adjusting Si quantity less than 0.20%. Fig. 6 is a diagram showing the relationship between FATT and Al content. The Al content increases FATT. When Cr is 2.05 to 2.2% and Ni is 3 to 4%, FATT can be lowered below 0\u00b0C by adjusting Al quantity to below 0.014%. When Cr is 2.2 to 2.5% and Ni is 3.5 to 4.5%, the value can be lowered below 0\u00b0C by adjusting Al quantity to below 0.018%. When Cr is near 1.65%, even if Ni quantity is as high as 3.5%, FATT is difficult to lower below 0\u00b0C if Al quantity is reduced. Fig. 7 shows the relationship between magnetic field strength and Si quantity. Because the increase of Si quantity intensifies magnetic field strength as shown in the figure, the Si quantity should be as small as possible for present purposes. Particularly, when Cr is 1.5 to 2.5 % and Ni is 2.5 to 4.5%, magnetic field strength at 21kG can be suppressed below 990AT/cm by adjusting Si quantity to less than 0.18%. Particularly, when Si quantity is less than 0.1%, a magnetic strength of less than 700AT/cm is obtained. Fig. 8 is a diagram showing the relationship between magnetizing force and the total amount of P, S, Sn, Sb and As. These impurities are undesirable because they increase magnetic field strength and their concentration should be less than 0.040% to adjust magnetic field strength below 990AT/cm. Particularly, it should be less than 0.03% to lower it below 700AT/cm. Fig. 9 shows the relationship between magnetic field strength and Al content. As shown in the figure, Al is undesirable because it intensifies magnetic field strength. When Cr is 1.5 to 2.5% and Ni is 2.5 to 4.5% and even when Si quantities are less than 0.1%, Al quantity should be below 0.025% to obtain a magnetic field strength of less than 990AT/cm. Particularly, to obtain a magnetic field strength of less than 700AT/cm, Al quantity should be lowered below 0.015%. If Si quantity exceeds 0.1%, Al quantity should be less than 0.01%. Fig. 10 shows the influence on magnetic field strength of the quantity of Si multiplied by the total amount of P, S, Sn, Sb and Ab and the higher this quantity is, the more inappropriate it is because magnetic field strength is increased. Magnetic field strength can be lowered below 990AT/cm by adjusting the quantity to less than 70 x 10-4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Previous studies suggested that the age-related decline in triathlon performance was specific to the discipline, with cycling showing fewer declines in performance with age than running in both short distance and Ironman triathletes. The present results showed that the swimming and cycling performances were maintained until the age of 54 for the Deca Iron ultra-triathletes but only until the age of 44 for the Triple Iron ultra-triathletes. A potential explanation for this finding could be pre-race experience. It has been shown that previous experience was a strong predictor for a successful finish in an ultra-triathlon . Recently, Lepers et al.  analysed the performance of 73 triathletes (68 men and 5 women) who finished a Double Iron ultratriathlon, a Triple Iron ultra-triathlon and a Deca Iron ultra-triathlon. The contribution of swimming to overall ultra-triathlon performance was lower than for cycling and running. Running performance was more important to overall performance for Double Iron ultra-triathlon and Triple Iron ultra-triathlon compared to Deca Iron ultra-triathlon.

In contrast to our hypothesis, the age of the best overall performance did not differ between Triple Iron ultra-triathlon and Deca Iron ultratriathlon and was comprised between25 and 44 years for both ultra-triathlon distances. However, the group with the largest participation at the Triple Iron ultra-triathlon (35 to 39 years) was younger compared to the Deca Iron ultra-triathletes (40 to 44 years). We analysed in the present study the age-related decline in Triple Iron ultra-triathletes competing for approximately 2,000 min compared to Deca Iron ultra-triathletes racing for approximately 12,000 min. A significant age effect was found for total race time with no difference between the distances. A previous study evidenced that the age-related decline in total performance was less pronounced for the Olympic distance triathlon (approximately 2 to 3 h) than for the Ironman distance triathlon (approximately9to15h) . The present data showed that, in ultra-triathlons, the athletes were able to maintain their best performances for ages comprised between 25 and 44 years, independent of the distance. In half-marathoners , marathoners  and short distance triathletes , generally athletes in the age group 20 to 30 years showed the fastest race times compared to athletes in the other age groups. For longer distances such as the Ironman triathlon, athletes in the age group 30 to 39 years were faster compared to athletes in the age group 20 to 29 years . Apart from training, also the aspect of pre-race experience seems to be important for a successful finish in an ultra-triathlon. It has been demonstrated that the personal best time in a Triple Iron triathlon, not anthropometry or training volume, was associated with total race time in a Triple Iron triathlon . Furthermore, the number of finished Triple Iron triathlons and the personal best time in a Triple Iron triathlon, but not anthropometry, were also related to Deca Iron ultratriathlon race time ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

A large component of lost independence with increasing age is weakness due to a loss of lean muscle mass. Muscle power is lost at a greater rate than is endurance capacity with 3.5% versus 1.8% per year, respectively . The agerelated loss of muscle mass is primarily due to a decrease in the size of type II (fast-twitch) muscle fibres and a change in the proportions of fibre types .

The swimming was held in a 50-m heated outdoor pool at a temperature of approximately 25\u00b0C, and wetsuits were allowed. After passing through the transition area, the participants cycled 67 laps of 8 km each on a hilly course in the surroundings of the town. At the next transition, the athletes changed and ran 96 laps of a 1.31-km per lap flat run course in the town of Lensahn. The cycling course was nearly free of road traffic, and the run course was completely free of traffic and illuminated during the night. All the athletes had their own support crew to provide nutrition and changes of clothes or equipment. The athletes had to arrive at the finish line within 58 h of the race start. The Deca Iron ultra-triathlon took place in Monterrey, Mexico. The athletes completed a total distance of 38-km swimming, 1,800-km cycling and 422-km running. Swimming commenced in the 50-m outdoor pool in Monterrey in the 'Sociedad Cuauhtemoc & Famosa Park' , 3 km away from the cycle and run track in 'Parque Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes'.T h e pool was not heated and the water temperature was approximately 27\u00b0C. The laps of 100 m were counted by personal lap counters for each athlete. After completing the swimming, the athletes changed in the transition area, and due to the high traffic volume, were transferred by car to 'Parque Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes'. A period of 30 min was allowed for the transfer from pool to park, which was deducted from the final race time. The park was closed to traffic, completely illuminated and with a 1.915-km cycle/run track that is approximately 95% flat but included an inclination of approximately 5%. After the cycling, the athletes changed and went directly to the run course which was on the same track but in the opposite direction. Drafting in the cycle section was strictly prohibited and controlled by the race director. The laps on both the cycle and run courses were counted electronically using a microchip system. The athletes can be helped by their own support crew for nutrition and changes of equipment and clothes. During the whole race, accommodation is offered in the Sports Village inside the park, about 250 m away from the race site.

Chromatin is divided intotwo forms, euchromatin and heterochromatin. Euchromatin is a loosely packaged form of chromatin that has a high concentration of genes and is often involved in active transcription or is at least potentiated for transcription. In contrast, heterochromatin is a denser packaging of DNA and proteins, which has many varieties. Heterochromatin is considered to be transcriptionally inactive since the genes are less accessible to transcription factors (Figure 1). Changes in chromatin's structure are affected by chemical modifications of histones such as methylation and acetylation, and by the binding of other proteins and ions to the DNA. Most of the modifications are reversible, providing dynamics to the chromatin structure and activity that allows for opening of previously sequestered genes or suppression of previously active genes in response to stimuli and cell cycle progression. Charges on the histones are shown as blue (positive), red (negative), and white (neutral). The positive charges of histones facilitate binding to negatively charged DNA and thereby packaging the DNA to reduce the overall volume needed for the chromatin. Euchromatin is an extended form of chromatin that allows access to the underlying genes. Heterochromatin is a condensed form with histone H1 (orange) bound to the linker DNA between nucleosomes. This can compact the chromatin further and sequesters the underlying genes. The chromatin is further organized into loops that are usually tightly coiled and stacked into chromosomes but the loops can rapidly uncoil into extended states as depicted to allow access to sequestered genes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Nucleosomes occur on average every 200 base pairs (bp) in chromatin with 145 bp (core DNA) in close contact with the histone core and another approximately 55 bp in the linker section (linker DNA) between nucleosome cores. The abundance of positively charged arginine and lysine residues in histones are sufficient to counter roughly half of the negative charges in the core DNA, thereby reducing the self-repulsion of the DNA and allowing a sevenfold compaction of the length held in DNA coils around the histone core. Histones are small globular proteins (11-15 kD) with flexible N-terminal tails that project from the nucleosome core. Epigenetic modification sites in the chromatin structure consist primarily of lysine, arginine and serine residues in the N-terminal tails of core histones that are post-translationally modified by acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination/sumoylation, ADP ribosylation, deimination/citrullination, protein conjugation, or \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamination. As a consequence, the N-terminal tails can undergo modifications that add to or reduce the interactions of the histones on neighboring histones, DNA and nuclear proteins therefore affecting gene transcription ( Huber et al., 2007;Dieker and Muller, 2010). For example, positively charged lysine residues can non-covalently bind to the negatively charged phosphate groups in the DNA but acetylation of a lysine residue removes the positive charge and reduces the histone-DNA interaction. An additional histone, histone H1, can bind to the linker DNA between nucleosomes allowing stacking of nucleosomes to provide further compaction of the chromatin. Histone H1 is more abundant in heterochromatin.

The majority of X-linked genes are not sex-specific. Therefore, the majority of X-linked genes should have equivalent expression in males and females. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is an epigenetic event initiated in each cell early in development that leads to the transcriptional silencing of one of thetwo X chromosomes in females. Consequently, the mechanism results in equal dosage of genes in males and females such that only one X chromosome is transcriptionally active in both sexes with equal amounts of the products of X-linked genes synthesized in cells (Brooks, 2010). The inactive chromosome is referred to as Xi and the active as Xa.

In the case of the inactive X chromosome, roughly 85% of the genes are kept silent in order to attain dosage compensation of X-linked genes. Besides the histone modifications described above, silencing of the inactive X chromosome exemplifies the use of two other major epigenetic mechanisms to suppress genes: DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. DNA methylation in which a methyl group is added to cytosine bases in a DNA strand alters the topology in the major groove of DNA, which can mask binding sites from transcription factors, thereby suppressing expression of the underlying gene. RNA can also play a role in epigenetics in four different ways: (1) as a structural RNA, such as the X inactivation specific transcript (XIST RNA) which coats the inactive X chromosome; (2) as an agent recruiting histone modifying enzymes, such as deacetylases, to a site; (3) as a direct block to prevent transcription factors from initiating gene transcription; and (4) as an agent to hybridize with nascent RNA transcripts leading to degradation by ribonucleases that target double-stranded RNA (Bernstein and Allis, 2005)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

The pro-apoptotic death associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase) gene is regulated by DNA methylation and Toso et al. (2009) demonstrated that DNA demethylation of this gene was restricted to the SS subgroup, compared to the non-SS subgroup, in which the gene was aberrantly hypermethylated. Another argument linking DNA methylation and lymphoma predisposition in SS is related to the hypermethylation of the runt-related transcription factor (RUNX1) gene in CD4 + T cells from SS patients (Altorok et al., 2014). Tobon et al. (2013) showed increased levels of Flt-3L in the sera of18 patients with pSS and previous lymphoma in contrast with patients with pSS without lymphoma. Additionally, the analysis of biological parameters showed that lymphocytopenia, low levels of C4 and high levels of Flt-3L were associated with previous occurrence of lymphoma ( Tobon et al., 2013). An epigenetic control of FLt3-L in SGECs is suspected and experiments should be conducted in SS patients to test this hypothesis."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

At the molecular level, SGEC global DNA demethylation was associated with a decrease in the methylating enzyme DNMT1 and an increase in the demethylating partner Gadd45alpha. These observations support an active DNA demethylation process in SGEC from SS patients. Furthermore, SGEC DNA methylation levels were inversely correlated with SS severity and B cell infiltration. The contribution of B cells in the demethylation process was further explored in SS patients treated with rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody from the TEARS study (Devauchelle-Pensec et al., 2007;Thabet et al., 2013). Indeed, global DNA methylation levels were higher4 months after B cell depletion in comparison with the minor salivary gland biopsy obtained at the initiation of rituximab therapy, thus suggesting that DNA demethylation in SGEC may be attributed in part to the presence of infiltrating B cells. This hypothesis was confirmed in vitro, revealing in co-culture that B cell mediated DNA demethylation in SGEC works through an alteration of the Erk/DNMT1 pathway."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

No changes in the usual racing procedure were required for the purposes of the experiment. As not all studied subjects participated in all the races, the analysis was of data from 61 individual races in LW and 82 in MW.

Each subject wore their HR monitor on land before their warm-up period. For each individual, the exact time of the start of the HR recording was noted.

Prior to the test subjects lay quietly on a bed for15 min for the measurement of their resting HR (HR rest ). Then the test was performed on a 0 graded treadmill (Woodway, Ergo XELG 90, Weil, Germany). It began with a 3-min warm-up period at 9 kmAEh-1 , immediately followed by 1 kmAEh-1 increment every minute till exhaustion. Oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) was considered maximal (VO 2max ) if the following criteria were achieved: (1) a levelling off of VO 2 despite a treadmill speed increase; (2) a respiratory gas exchange ratio higher than 1.1, and (3) attainment of age theoretical HR max \u00b15 bpm. All the subjects achieved physiological criteria for VO 2max. The peak HR attained at exhaustion during maximal graded exercise was considered to be HR max ( Chamari et al. 1995). Exhaustion occurred within 10-15 min of exercise for all subjects. The measurement of the cardiorespiratory variables was performed with a breath-by-breath cardiorespiratory device (ZAN 680, Oberthulba, Germany). This system allowed the continuous measurement of HR, pulmonary gas exchange, and ventilation during the test. Prior to each test the gas analysers were calibrated with gases of known concentrations. The ventilatory membrane was calibrated with a 1-l syringe. HR was determined from a six-lead ECG with 12 derivations. On the test reports, HR and the respiratory data were provided once every 30 s with the values averaged on the ten last respiratory cycles on a sliding technique basis ( Whipp et al. 1982)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

It has been shown that the HR expressed as a percentage of HR max is more representative of exercise intensity than the absolute HR value ( Gilman and Wells 1993;Londeree et al. 1995). Furthermore, when expressed as a percentage of HR reserve , i.e. HR max-HR rest , the HR was closely related to VO 2 in continuous exercise (Gilman 1996). It has recently been shown that even if the exercise pattern is intermittent, in long aerobic exercise such as tennis, HR time course is similar to that of VO 2 ( Dansou et al. 2001). The present results show that the subjects sailed with HRs representing80.5 and 76.2%HR max in LW and MW, respectively. This is slightly lower than values reported by Gue\u00b4vel Gue\u00b4vel et al. (1999), namely 87.4 and 82.9%HRmax, respectively. This may not be due to race duration, as HR was not correlated to race duration in either study. De Vito et al. (1997) have reported even higher values representing about 92% HR max , but these values were measured over short periods of time in a race simulation. The slightly lower %HR max values observed in the present study may not be explained by the presence of a female windsurfer in the group, as De Vito et al. (1997) and Vogiatzis et al. (2002) have shown similar %HR max in male and female athletes when pumping. A possible cause of the lower relative HRs could be due to the pumping pattern of the studied subjects. Gue\u00b4vel Gue\u00b4vel et al. (2000) have shown that two periods of 6-minutes simulated pumping with two frequencies (1.5 vs. 1 Hz) with the same energy expenditure, resulted in a cardiac response representing 77.1 and 80.2%HRmax respectively. The time to exhaustion (in a separate test) was threefold longer for the short and frequent pumping with respect to the high amplitude one. It is then possible that the present study subjects used more the short pumping than the subjects of Gue\u00b4vel Gue\u00b4vel et al. (1999). It has been reported that if high magnitude pumping is more strenuous, it is more effective at increasing board speed (Gue\u00b4velGue\u00b4vel et al. 2000). Lastly, an experimental difference could have caused the observed discrepancies in racing intensity, as Gue\u00b4vel Gue\u00b4vel et al. (1999) only analysed the first race of each competition day. The present study analysed all the races sailed for a given day, which corresponded to two to three races a day with 15-20 min of recovery in between.

Billat and Koralsztein (1996) have reported that the second ventilatory threshold is a good indicator of aerobic power. One explanation for the observed negative correlation could be that subjects with lower thresholds have to make a greater relative effort than the fitter ones to generate similar work, resulting in a higher HR. In that case, it is possible that the fittest athletes were often sailing under or just at the level of their respective anaerobic threshold leading to a relatively moderate HR (De Vito et al. 1997). It is possible that the athletes with good aerobic power need only to make a relatively low effort during races against athletes with poorer fitness levels. The present results confirm that Olympic windsurfing is an endurance activity in which physiological variables have an important bearing on performance (De Vito et al. 1997). Indeed it has been reported that, depending on the part of the race, Olympic windsurfing can be compared to a2000-m rowing event (i.e. 90-95% HR max for about 6.5 min) for the downwind leg and to what has been defined as the ''efficient active recovery stage'' of cycling and swimming (75-80% HR max ) for the upwind leg (Gue\u00b4velGue\u00b4vel et al. 2000)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

The discovery of a short-period giant planet (a hot Jupiter) around the primary component of the triple star system HD 188753 has often been considered as an important observational evidence and as a serious challenge to planet-formation theories. Aims. Following this discovery, we monitored HD 188753 duringone year to better characterize the planetary orbit and the feasibility of planet searches in close binaries and multiple star systems. Methods. We obtained Doppler measurements of HD 188753 with the ELODIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. We then extracted radial velocities for the two brightest components of the system using our multi-order, two-dimensional correlation algorithm, TODCOR. Results. Our observations and analysis do not confirm the existence of the short-period giant planet previously reported around HD 188753 A. Monte Carlo simulations show that we had both the precision and the temporal sampling required to detect a planetary signal like the one quoted. Conclusions. From our failure to detect the presumed planet around HD 188753 A and from the available data on HD 188753, we conclude that there is currently no convincing evidence of a close-in giant planet around HD 188753 A."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

The occurrence of planets in binaries with semimajor axes below 100 AU is therefore still largely unprobed.

This algorithm uses two templates with a given flux ratio and unknown Doppler shifts to compute the two-dimensional correlation function, whose maximum simultaneously gives the radial velocity of both components. Our version of TODCOR uses as templates high signal-to-noise stellar spectra built up using spectra from our planet search programs with CORALIE and ELODIE (Queloz et al. 2000;Perrier et al. 2003), along with spectra from the surveys for low-mass companions to M dwarfs by Delfosse and coworkers ( Delfosse et al. 1998Delfosse et al. , 1999).

This method is based on the measurement of the eigenfrequency of a Ushaped glass tube filled with the sample. In the standard setup (DMA 58, A. PAAR K.G., Graz, Aus-tria) the external force is of the same amplitude as the damping force but phase shifted by 180degrees to maintain steady oscillation. Such a mechanically driven oscillation can be represented by the external force F , and the following three internal forces: the elastic spring force which is proportional to the dislocation x of the mass cx (c is the spring constant), the damping force (energy absorbing) which is proportional to the velocity x' of the mass bx' (b is the damping constant) and the mass force which is proportio-nal to the acceleration mx\" of the mass m of the system . The external force F , must compensate the damping force, i.e., it must be equal to-bx'. Such a system with synchronized external force will perform a steady harmonic oscillation with a dislocation This situation is visualized in Fig. 5. We call this operation mode, where the external force is balancing the damping force, in phase mode. Here we are not further interested in the well known details of densitometry, but we have to discuss the modifications that allow the qualitative determination of the damping force (viscosity) with such a densitometer. Actually it can be shown that it is possible to measure the ratio between the damping force and the spring force utilizing a second experiment with a phase shifted mode. In this mode the external force Fen is shifted by 45 degrees. The amplitude is increased so that-.\"C;1 the component in direction of the damping force remains constant (see In this mode we observe a different frequency a , or period T,.

These transition times between thethree disciplines are part of the overall race time. As such, a triathlete's ability to negotiate each transition quickly and effectively has been highlighted as an important factor for overall success in the event . However, to our knowledge, no study has previously focused on the changes in the transition times over the years in Ironman triathletes. Overall race time could also be substantially improved by a reduction in transition times. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the change in transition time in 'Ironman Hawaii' across years. Since both female and male triathletes have improved overall race times and split times during the last three decades, we hypothesized that both women and men also improved transition times across years. To investigate a potential difference in transition times between different race distances, we also compared transition times in 'Ironman Hawaii' to transition times in the World Championships 'Ironman 70.3' covering the half distance (1.9 km swimming, 90 km cycling and 21.1 km running) of the Ironman distance triathlon."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

All competitors who finished within the top ten in the 'Ironman World Championship' Hawaii between 1998 and 2013 were analyzed regarding their change in performance, the sex difference in performance and the transition times. Before 1998, transition times were not separately recorded in the race results. Therefore, data before 1998 could not be included into data analysis. To determine the sex difference in performance, overall race times and split times of the annual top and of the annual top ten women and men were taken from the race results of the organizer. Unfortunately, data from [6] do not allow to differentiate the two transition times (i.e. swimming to cycling and cycling to running) during the whole period 19982013. Therefore, absolute transition times were determined in absolute values by calculating the difference between overall race time and split times using the equation overall race times-(swimming times + cycling Table 1 Multi-level regression analyses for change in transition times (i.e. in absolute times and relative in % of overall race times) for the annual fastest and annual ten fastest across years after correction for multiple finishes in 'Ironman Hawaii' times + running times). Relative transition time was expressed as a percentage of overall race times using the equation 100/overall race times \u00d7 transition times. The sex difference was calculated using the equation (times in women-times in men)/times in men \u00d7 100, where the sex difference was calculated for every pair of equally placed athletes (e.g. between female and male winner, between men and women 2 nd place, etc.) before calculating mean value and standard deviation of all pairs.

A further limitation is that transition times between swimming and cycling and between cycling and running were not separated but unfortunately transition times between the disciplines were provided only in recent years. The age of the athletes was not included. It has recently been shown that sex differences in overall race times differed between age groups in sprint, Olympic distance, and half Ironman triathlon . Since the sex difference in long-distance triathlon increased with increasing race distance , future studies should investigate the sex difference in transition times for different triathlon distances. In addition, the present study focused on elite triathletes only, it would interesting to analyse (i) the sex difference in transition times for age groups triathletes and (ii) the agerelated change in transition times.

Abstract In most Western European countries, including Belgium, judicial alternative sanctions are increasingly being used for drug users. Because no study into the effectiveness of Belgian judicial alternatives for drug users has yet been carried out, this became the objective of the current research. The design of this study comprises a pre and post measurement of the criminal activity, drug use and situation in different spheres of life of565 drug-dependent offenders. Two conclusions can be drawn. First, after an alternative sanction or measure is imposed, there is a reduction in the criminal activity of the offender. Second, this crime reduction goes hand in hand with a progress in several relevant life spheres."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Regarding recidivism, the pre measurement concerns the calculation of rates of criminal charges and convictions (number per year) before the judicial alternative was granted. For the post measurement the same rates are calculated, but in this case for the period after the judicial alternative was granted. The calculation of these rates is based on criminal record data, gathered from criminal courts. Our results are thus only based on registered crime, while not necessarily all offences committed by the research subjects are known to the police. This so-called dark number is a much described limitation of officially registered crime, which has to be considered in the interpretation of the results. The measurement of progress in relevant life spheres comprises a pre and post measurement as well. The situation in these life spheres was studied in judicial files (of the prosecutor's office and of judicial assistants). Based on these files the researcher assessed the situation in the life spheres before and after the judicial alternative was granted, on the basis of the grid shown in Table 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

The reference years of the judicial files were 1999 and 2001. The reference years are thus quite recent while still allowing for a considerable follow-up period. From the lists that were provided by the justice authorities, probability samples were drawn for each modality. In order to determine whether a causal relationship exists between two variables (e.g. an alternative sanction and recidivism), the criteria for methodological quality are high . Mostly, the Maryland Scientific Methods (MSM) Scale, a five level scale of research designs, is used as reference point for the identification of effect studies of good methodological quality. Only based on a (quasi-)experimental design, level three to five of the MSM Scale, can the conclusion be drawn that a reduction in recidivism is caused by the alternative sanction. In a quasi-experimental design recidivism would be measured before and after the intervention (i.e. the judicial alternative) in experimental and comparable control conditions. Our study does however not reach this methodological standard. In fact, our study corresponds to the second level of the MSM Scale, which implies the measurement of recidivism before and after the alternative measure/sanction, but without a comparable control condition. The Belgian sentencing practice does not allow for the use of the classical experimental design: magistrates generally opt for alternative sanctions when adjudicating a drug offender. Only if the offences are too serious, or if the offender persists in crime, is a traditional sanction imposed . Given this sentencing practice, any control group would substantially differ from the experimental groupthose who are granted a judicial alternative are not comparable to those who are adjudicated the traditional way."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

We compare the rate (number per year) of criminal charges and convictions prior to the judicial alternative with the rate afterwards. Table 5 shows that the average rate of criminal charges decreases to about half of its original value. Whereas the research subjects on average were subjected to more than two criminal charges per year before the alternative was granted, this was reduced to only one afterwards. The research subjects thus have less criminal charges after the alternative was granted. This is true for the alternatives at every level of the criminal justice system: the average rate of criminal charges is lower after the alternative was granted than prior to it. This reduction is significant (p<0,001).

However, studies examining prevalence of recidivism often find high percentages. For example, Zanis studied persons who were referred to treatment services via \"early parole\". He found that22% of the research subjects were reconvicted within 24 months, compared to 34% of the control group (parolees who had not been referred to treatment). In a study examining treatment in prison a relatively high prevalence of recidivism was found as well. After treatment in prison, it appears that 58% of the graduated was rearrested and 79% relapsed into drug use in a follow-up period of 5 years. In a Swedish study, Bishop examined the effects of treatment after imprisonment: the results showed that 64% of those who completed treatment committed a new offence within 3 years following completion of the treatment. A UK Home Office research found that 86% of the persons who were granted a Drug Treatment and Testing Order, were reconvicted within a follow-up period of 2 years. The high prevalence of recidivism thus is not out of line with results of other studies. The fact that the percentages are so high, makes people question the effectiveness of alternative measures for drug users.

Studying rates of criminal charges and convictions may put the high prevalence of recidivism into perspective. In the current study, rates of criminal charges and conviction rates were lower after the alternative was imposed than prior to it. This means that-even if the research subjects reoffend-the number of charges per year decreases, as does the number of convictions per year. Considerable progress could also be observed in the current study as regards the nature of the offences. Only 45% of the sample (or 61% of the recidivists) had a new charge for infringements of drug legislation-although all research subjects are drug users. Even if account is only taken of the recidivists, it appears that a lower percentage of the research subjects commit infringements of drug legislation, property offences and violent crime after sanctioning than prior to it.

(iii) There is a reduction of infringements of the drug legislation, property offences and violent crime. Even if there is no certainty that these successes can be ascribed to alternative sanctions (because of the absence of a control group), it is still a fact that the alternative sanctions allowed for these developments in a way that is far less interventionist and harmful than a prison sentence. The recidivism reducing effects of alternative measures were also shown in other studies. In a research conducted by MacKenzie, for example, a self report was held among probationers. They were asked to compare their activities prior to the probation order with those after their arrest and the start of the probation period. The interviews were held shortly after the start of the probation period, and again after a period of 6 months. In the interviews it became clear that the average level of criminal activity and drug use was lower after arrest and during the probation period than previous to the arrest. We could even argue that the reduction in criminal activity is shown more convincingly in our study, because of the fact that we made use of registered crime data and not of self report measurement, which possibly is influenced by a social desirability bias. Moreover, it is shown that alternative measures have better results than traditional ones. In American studies regarding effectiveness of drug courts the results are generally similar: clients of the drug court programs have lower recidivism rates than those whose case was adjudicated the traditional way. Spohn observed that 42,1% of the drug court participants reoffended, compared to 60,8% of the research subjects with a traditional sanction. Comparable results (drug court participants have lower levels of recidivism) are found in eight out of nine studies regarding effectiveness of drug courts.

Not every charge was followed by a conviction, because less-serious charges are dismissed by the public prosecutor. Just overone third of the research subjects were reconvicted. The prevalence of recidivism differed according to the level of alternative sanction: the prevalence of criminal charges and reconviction increased in line with the level of settlement of the judicial alternative. Even though the prevalence of recidivism is high, literature shows that this is not out of line with other studies. Besides, it is beyond doubt that there is a reduction in recidivism after a judicial alternative is granted. On average, the research subjects incur less criminal charges and convictions after the judicial alternative is granted than prior to it. Also there is a decrease in the consensual drug related crime, property crime and violent crime committed by research subjects (expressive and acquisitive crime). This goes together with a remarkable progress in life spheres: research subjects use less drugs-and use it in a less problematic way-have more supportive family and social relationships and their leisure time is occupied. Regarding their work situation there is a progress as well, but less pronounced. The association found between recidivism reduction and life spheres is important. Progress in the abovementioned life spheres supports the positive evolution regarding recidivism reduction. The perspectives are thus promising, as chances are higher that changes will last longer.

Intuitively, s is required to identify the position of the contact. The force/torque measurements F could be avoided if we were interested in learning contacts that do not change between training and test time, which would restrict us to static objects, such as a rigid floor, walls or stationary obstacles. However, as this assumption is limiting in our context, we include the force/torque measurements F in our model. The resulting regression of Equation (5) is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the input x \u2208 X (the skin measurements s alone account forhundreds of dimensions) and nonlinearity. Observing that the contact forces term \u03c4 CM is a sum over multiple contacts, we can tackle this challenging regression by decomposing the \u03c4 CM into a sum of multiple regression problems, where each regression problem is a single contact. Since each contact is uniquely defined by its position, we can make contact torque contribution of each single contact model independent of the skin, and use the skin only to decide which contact model is currently active.

The iCub has 53 degrees of freedom and is 104 cm tall for 24 kg of weight. The robot is not equipped with joint torque sensors, but it has four 6-axis force/torque sensors placed proximally in the middle of legs and arms, and an artificial skin consisting of more than 3000 tactile sensors, mounted on the robot covers . Each of these sensors provide a signal in the interval \u2208 [0,255] correlated to the force applied orthogonally to the sensor. In our experiments, we control 4 DoF of the iCub arm: shoulder pitch, roll and jaw, and elbow. The skin input s from the forearm consists of 384 sensors. In the iCub the joint torques are not estimated by the motors currents, but via an analytic model with identified dynamics parameters , which updates the estimation thanks to the inertial, tactile and force/torque measurements . We compute, on a PC outside the robot, the desired joint torques at the frequency of 50 Hz and then send the commands to the robot interface Yarp. A low-level controller implemented on the motor boards takes care of tracking the desired joint torques, sent through the robot interface. Both the estimation of the joint torques and the low-lever controller are transparent to our learned model as we use the desired torques (instead of the measured torques) as targets y during the training of the models."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

In our case, we decided to learn such ID model from scratch using Gaussian Processes. The reason for this choice are the unmodeled dynamics (q, \u02d9 q, \u00a8 q), which introduce substantial errors even in absence of contacts. In this subsection we present an experimental validation of the learned (contact-free) inverse dynamics. To validate the learned ID model we firstly compared the tracking error, in absence of obstacles. The task used for the experimental validation of the proposed approach consists of a tracking task with the left arm of the iCub where each of thefour joints of the arm should follow a pre-designed trajectory. In Table I we collected the tracking errors obtained averaging over 20 repetitions. The results shows that the learned ID model reduces the tracking error, compared to the simple PD controller. The visualization of Figure 4 shows the average error tracking for the shoulder jaw. As second comparison we analyzed the contribution to the desired torque from the PD controller \u03c4 PD. In Figure 5 it is visible that when using the learned ID model, \u03c4 PD is drastically reduced. Both experimental results suggests that the learned ID model is accurate and useful for the desired tracking task."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

However, in this experiments we include the presence of a dynamic obstacle, specifically a filled1-liter bottle of water. For classical controllers, when an obstruction occur, the rigid body inverse dynamics does not account for this variation. As a result, the tracking error increases and with it also the contribution of the PD feedback controller increases to compensate for this tracking error. In this scenario, we demonstrate that using a learned contact model improves the tracking accuracy when unforeseen and dynamic obstacles are encountered along the path."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Using these data collected, we trained the contact model using as target the difference between the desired torque and the inverse dynamics model contribution \u03c4 ID (we here assume a single contact model). Following, we repeated the experiment comparing the full controller PD + ID + CM, the simple PD, and PD + ID. In Table II are collected the tracking errors for thethree control schema and for all the four joint, averaged over 20 repetitions. The presence of the contact model proved beneficial in terms of tracking error for three out of four joints. For the elbow, the PD +ID performed slightly better. However, it is important to notice that the joints that are most involved in the trajectory are the shoulder pitch and shoulder jaw. In Figure 6 is shows the average tracking error (for the shoulder jaw) for the considered control modes. It is clearly visible that after about 1 second from the contact with the obstacle, the contact model reduce the tracking error. From these results we can conclude that using the additional learned contact model is beneficial.

This is due to hardware limitations of the iCub skin. In fact, the current skin presentstwo main issues: 1) high levels of noise. Even without contacts, some sensors will occasionally fire as if in presence of strong forces applied. 2) Mechanical compliance of the skin. When applying a force, The sum of these two issues resulted in the introduction of delays for the identification of contacts and therefore the use of the additional contact model. This delay, which we estimate around 500ms is visible in both Figure 6 and Figure 7. Often even for a human expert it is hard to distinguish between measurement noise and a real contact when observing short (i.e., less than 100 ms) windows of data. A second issue we encountered during the training of both inverse dynamics model and contact models, is that the torques applied from the basic PD controller implemented on the iCub suffer from a high noise. As a result of this high degree of noise, we had to filter the desired torques. However, filtering the desired torques inevitably introduce small errors in the models learned. We expect that a smoother desired torques would result in a more accurate learned model and even lower tracking error."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

The estimation from the learned model does not rely on dynamic parameters, but it is completely data-driven: uncalibrated tactile sensors provide raw information about the contact, while force/torque sensors provide information about the wrenches perceived by the robotic structure. As a result, our approach does not require a spatially calibrated model of the skin. We believe that this feature is particularly relevant with the increasing availability of miniaturized skin sensors.
