Triathlon represents an intriguing alternative model for analyzing the effects of age and sex upon endurance and ultra-endurance (> 6 hours) performance because sex differences and age-related declines in performance can be analyzed in the same persons across the three separate disciplines. The relative participation of both females and masters athletes (age > 40 years old) in triathlon has increased consistently over the past 25 years. Sex differences in triathlon performance are also known to differ between the modes of locomotion adopted (swimming, cycling or running) for both elite and non-elite triathletes. Generally, time differences between sexes in swimming have been shown to be smaller on average than during cycling and running. Both physiological and morphological factors contribute to explaining these findings. Performance density (i.e. the time difference between the winner and 10 th placed competitor) has progressively improved (time differences have decreased) for international races over the past two decades for both males and females, with performance density now very similar for both sexes. For age-group triathletes, sex differences in total triathlon performance time increases with age. The possible difference in age-related changes in the physiological determinants of endurance and ultra-endurance performances between males and females needs further investigation however.

Currently, more than 1700 triathletes , most of whom have to qualify at one of 25 Ironman triathlons worldwide, participate in this event which has become the Ironman World Championship.  Short or Olympic distance triathlons (1.5km swim, 40km cycle and 10km run) have also rapidly grown in popularity during approximately the same period with the first World Championship being held in Avignon (France) in 1989. Triathlon was officially accepted into the Olympic games as a full sport in Sydney in 2000.  Ultra-triathlons, consisting of distances greater than Ironman distance include double Ironman triathlons (7.6km swim, 360km cycle and 84 km run) and decaIronman triathlon (38km swim, 1800km cycle and 420 km run) also appeared during the 1980\"s with the first double Ironman triathlon held in 1985 in Huntsville (USA).  More recently, in addition to conventional road based triathlon, off-road triathlon combining swimming, mountain biking and trail running has also established itself in the field of endurance sports, and has grown very rapidly in popularity.  Triathlon performance has been studied from numerous perspectives by a number of research groups over approximately the same period that the sport has grown. Research has investigated physiological  , biomechanical  , training  , nutritional  or medical  aspects of triathlon performance. Although Ironman triathlon is a relatively new ultra-endurance event, recently elite Ironman triathletes appear to have reached their performance limits  as has been observed in more traditional sports such as marathon running where performance times have plateaued.  With the increase in popularity of endurance sports worldwide, endurance sports have attract a greater participation of female and masters athletes (age >40 years) during recent times.  This review addresses the specific aspects of: i) sex differences and ii) age-related declines in triathlon performance. Sex differences in performance will be presented and discussed for each of the three disciplines and total event times for different distances and for both elite and age group triathletes. Age-related declines will be outlined by focusing on the performances of the best master triathletes because these athletes represent a unique model for studying the effects of high levels of physical training in persons of older age."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

For example, in2010 females accounted for 26%, 19% and 13% of athletes competing at short, half-Ironman and full-Ironman distance triathlons held in the region of Zurich (Switzerland)  . However, for ultra-triathlons, female participation remains relatively low, representing generally less than 10% of overall participant numbers.  The number of females finishing the Hawaii Ironman World Championship increased from 20 in 1981 (6% of participants) to more than 470 in 2010 (27 % of participants).  In Europe, there was also a progressive rise in the number of female Ironman finishers but overall rates were lower. In 2011, females accounted for 13% of the field at Ironman Switzerland.  Lower rates of female participation in Europe may because European Ironman triathlon is relatively younger compared to the Hawaii Ironman triathlon. Indeed, the first Hawaii Ironman was held in 1978, while one the first European Ironman, Ironman Switzerland, was held in 1995. Female participation in Ironman triathlon remains slightly lower compared to traditional endurance events such as marathon running, but greater than ultra-endurance events such as a 161-km ultramarathon. For example, Lepers & Cattagni  showed that the relative participation of females at the New-York City Marathon increased over the last 30 years from 17% to 33% of the total field. In contrast, females accounted for 20 % of the finishers in the same time period at 161-km ultramarathons in North America.

Current explanations for sex differences in V \uf026 O 2max among elite athletes, when expressed relative to body mass, provide two major findings.  First, elite females have more  body fat than males.  Indeed, much of the difference in V \uf026 O 2max between males and females disappears when it is expressed relative to lean body mass.  Second, the hemoglobin concentration of elite athletes is 5-10% lower in females than in males.  Concerning lactate threshold, there is no reason to believe that values should be lower in females than in males because mitochondrial adaptations in the skeletal muscles of highly-trained male and female athletes appear to be similar.  Finally, the average oxygen cost to run a given speed, (i.e. running economy) by groups of elite male and female athletes is similar and appears to play the same role in determining success in endurance performance. Therefore, the major physiological reason that explains the slower record performances by females compared to males is probably the lower V \uf026 O 2max values observed in females."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Males possess on average 7-9% less percent body fat than females, which is likely an advantage for males.

Surprisingly, very little data is available for short distance triathlons especially for high-level international races. One reason may be that the top international short distance triathlons, (i.e. World Championship Series events or Olympics) have all been draft legal for several years and therefore it is difficult to find a reference of high level Olympic distance triathlon without drafting for comparison. The increase in nondrafting international distance triathlons such the Hy-Vee triathlon that offers significant prize money for both male and female winners and represents a highly competitive platform for professional triathletes should help to better determine sex differences in short distance triathlon performance when athletes compete on a level (non-drafting) playing field in the future. Table 2 presents the most recent data for sex differences in triathlon performance for international elite triathletes participating in the most competitive races at each triathlon distance. By 2012, values narrowed so much that, for the top 10 triathletes overall in three top level international road-based triathlon races, the difference between males and females was 11.3% for the Hawaii Ironman triathlon, 14.1% for the Olympics and 9.3% for the Hy-Vee short distance triathlon (see Table 2).

However, the sex difference in performance between the best male and female ultra-swimmers is more generally close to 11-12%, which corresponds to values observed for swimming in triathlon.  It has been shown that the elite male and female triathletes completed the 3.8-km swim stage of the Hawaii Ironman triathlon ~ 10% slower than the elite swimmer specialists for the same distance at the Waikiki Roughwater Swim race.  This difference could be explained by better propelling efficiency in elite swimmers compared with elite triathletes.  Analysis from 2005 showed that the sex difference in triathlon swimming appears lower than in cycling and running at the Hawaii Ironman triathlon and at the off-road triathlon Xterra World Championship.  The difference between swimming and the two other disciplines could be explained in part by the biological difference in relative body fat (7-9 % higher in females).  Performance in activities that involve supporting ones weight, for example running, may be more susceptible to a greater body fat percentage compared to water-based events such as swimming, during which body fat can increase buoyancy and therefore improve performance.  Buoyancy is also improved in females through a lower \"underwater torque\", which can be defined loosely as the tendency for the feet to sink.  In addition, in contrast to running where the energy cost appears to be similar between females and males, the energy cost of freestyle swimming has been shown to be significantly higher (i.e. lower economy) in males compared to females.  At a velocity of 1 m/s, there are differences in drag force and coefficient of drag between males and females.  The energy cost of swimming depends essentially on the propelling efficiency of the arm stroke and hydrodynamic resistance, but it has been suggested that differences in energy costs of swimming between sexes are mainly to be attributed to differences in hydrodynamic resistance.  In contrast, differences in energy cost of swimming across ages may be attributed also to changes in the propelling efficiency of the arm stroke.  Females have smaller body size (resulting in smaller body drag), smaller body density (greater fat percent) and shorter lower limbs, resulting in a more horizontal and streamlined position and therefore a smaller underwater torque.

Moreover, there is a paucity of data concerning sex differences in road or track cycling performance.  In track cycling, where females are generally weaker than males in terms of power/weight ratios, the performance gap between males and females appears to be constant and independent of the race distance from 200 to 1000 m.  In ultra-cycling events, such as the \"Race Across America\", sex difference in performance was around 15% among top competitors.  Greater muscle mass and aerobic capacity in males, even expressed relative to the lean body mass  , may represent an advantage during long distance cycling, especially on a relative flat course such as Ironman cycling where cycling approximates to a non-weight-bearing sport. Indeed, it has been shown that absolute power output (which is greater for males than for females) is associated with successful cycling endurance performance because the primary force inhibiting forward motion on a flat course is air resistance.  Interestingly, for elite triathletes the sex difference in mountain bike cycling during off-road triathlon  is greater compared to cycling sex differences in conventional roadbased events.  Mountain biking differs in many ways from road cycling. Factors other than aerobic power and capacity such as off-road cycling economy, anaerobic power and capacity, and technical ability might influence off-road cycling performance.  Bouts of high intensity exercise frequently encountered during the mountain biking leg of off-road triathlon  can result from: 1) having to overcome the constraints of gravity associated with steep climbs, 2) variable terrain necessitating wider tires and thus greater rolling resistance, and 3) isometric muscle contractions associated with the needs of more skilled bike handling skills, not so often encountered in road cycling. In particular however, lower power-to-weight ratios for females compared to male triathletes inevitably leave them at a disadvantage during steep climbs.  Moreover, the increased bike handling skills, required especially during downhill mountain biking may be impaired by relatively lower female arm or leg isometric muscle strength, meaning that greater sex differences in off-road triathlon could be attributed to decreased ability to control the bicycle in females. However, this assumption needs to be confirmed with specific investigations of the effect of sex on technical ability in mountain biking.  As percentage differences in time do not equate to percent differences in power output, due to non-linear relationships between speed and power output from air or water resistance  , the magnitude of the sex difference has also been examined by calculating the percentage difference between males and females in estimated power outputs for each discipline.  In this case, differences in estimated power output between the sexes are greater for triathlon cycling than for the swimming and running disciplines. For example, sex differences in power output in swimming, cycling and running were estimated to be 28%, 39% and 33%, respectively for Ironman triathlon, and 30%, 45% and 33% for off-road triathlon.  Because power output is proportional to oxygen uptake, the magnitude of sex differences in power output provides a more realistic representation of underlying sex differences in physiological capacity. 2.6 Sex differences in triathlon running performance"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

For example, at the Hawaii Ironman triathlon between 1981 and 2008, the average time difference between 1st and 10 th place was smaller for male (5.8%) than for female athletes (7.5%).  During the past five years, the performance density has decreased , a trend which would suggest that in the future, high performing female athletes may be as performance dense as the males. In fact, Table 2 indicates that in 2012 performance density was similar across the two sexes for top international road-based triathlon events, regardless of format (Hawaii, Olympics and Hy-Vee). A notable exception to this was the Xterra World Championships (off-road triathlon) in which female performance density (12.2%) was considerably lower than the male performance density (4.6%). As explained earlier (section 2.5), this can likely be explained by the specific physiological and technical abilities needed for the mountain bike leg of Xterra, in particular explosive strength which favours males over females.  The small performance density observed for the London Olympics compared to other events, for both males and females, may be explained by the drafting component of the cycling leg that led to a grouped start of a number of athletes (approximately half of the field) at the beginning of the run leg. It must also be considered that a number of nations fielded >1 athlete, and identified a designated leader who was \"protected\" during the swim/cycle legs.

A number of explanations can be given to explain the smaller decline in cycling performance during triathlon compared to the declines in the other two disciplines. These include a lesser reduction in lactate threshold or economy during cycling, or a greater muscular fatigue during running with age, although these propositions remain to be validated. Some authors have though, attempted to explain this age-related phenomenon in cycling by proposing that the \"training stimulus\", the ability or will to train, is reduced in running compared to cycling.  In particular, this may be because running is associated with a greater amount of orthopedic injuries, which limits the ability to train in running.

These include an improvement of training facilities, coaching, training techniques, nutritional strategies and equipment, as well as the possibility that they have had better and prolonged access to the facilities required to train effectively. It is also obvious that the higher participation rates of master athletes increases the possibility of them obtaining better results due to the competitive nature of the sport. Additionally, athletes that have attained a number of good results and positive outcomes, have increased levels of motivation to train and compete in endurance events.  Accordingly, the better physical condition of older athletes is likely to increase competitive spirit, participation and performance.  The advancement of training quality is also a possible reason for these improved performance trends. Earlier studies suggested the performance decline with advancing age was due to decreased training volumes and intensity.  Other, more sociological, factors may also play a role in reducing the ability and motivation to train. These include greater work demands, demands of the family, a diminished inherent drive to push oneself or even train.  An important factor is also the greater amount of time needed by the body to recover from hard, physical effort resulting from training as humans age. Indeed, training for an Ironman triathlon is very demanding and in order to place in the top ten of an age group category, extremely high training volumes and intensities are required.  However, it has been suggested that masters athletes could optimize their quality of training, so they could reduce their training volume to save time for adequate recovery and remain injury free.  These studies suggest that masters triathletes have probably not reached their limits in ultra-endurance performance. Unfortunately, no information is available concerning the sporting background of these successful masters triathletes. Nevertheless, even if recreational masters athletes had relatively short training histories and little experience in triathlon, these successful athletes probably have lifelong histories of physical activity.

For DBPCFC and first accidental exposure, 4 classes were built by considering the score groups {1}, {2}, {3} and {4, 5} because of the low frequency of score 5. For the two-class discrimination, groups were formed by scores of either {1, 2, 3} or {4, 5}, as recommended by clinicians. Since eliciting dose values are fixed by levels by the clinician , its measure is not a continuous variable and cannot be predicted by a regression analysis. Moreover although eliciting dose could be considered as a class variable, a discriminant analysis cannot be directly performed because of numerous categories with low frequencie (Table 2). A first solution consisted in converting eliciting dose into a four or two-class variable by searching the best discriminated classification computed with all available variables. A second solution will be proposed in Section 3.3. Careful variable selection appeared especially as a major point of the analysis.

Thus a variable selection scheme independent from classification was also developed. Variables were retained in the model if either the corresponding p-value of the Kruskal-Wallis test was smaller than 0.10, or if the variable was selected by the stepwise Wilks' lambda (\u039b) criterion . The \u039b statistic was computed at each step with all variables already present in the model, whereas the F \u2212 to \u2212 enter statistic and corresponding p-value measure the discriminant power of a variable added to the preceding ones. For the latter, the maximal F \u2212 to \u2212 enter p-values used as entry and removal criteria were set by default to 0.15, as recommended by [7]. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was preferred to ANOVA, because variables were not always normally distributed in the classes induced by the scores. Note that the Wilks' lambda selection is based on the hypotheses of multi-normality of the variables vector distribution and equality of the within-class covariance matrices. In 1975, Lachenbruch  asserted that the F \u2212test is robust to small deviations of these hypotheses. We therefore decided to use the Wilks' lambda selection even though variables were not always normally distributed in the classes induced by the measures of severity. This variable selection scheme is a compromise between the assessment of variable marginal importance and the detection of a discriminant subset of predictors. This will allow first to provide biologists and allergists a list of informative variables in regards to the mechanisms involved in allergic reactions, and second to avoid keeping noisy variables that could degrade the performance of the learning algorithms. Biologists and allergists are particularly interested in using immunoassays as markers of the severity of peanut allergy because Specific IgE to rAra-h1, rAra-h2, rAra-h3 are yet known to be very useful in practice to detect peanut allergic patients . Moreover immunoassays are precise and reliable measures contrary to SPTs. But the number of discriminant SPTs can far exceed the number of selected immunoassays, which could possibly smear out the signal brought by immunoassays. As we wanted nevertheless to keep the information provided by SPTs, a Multiple Factorial Analysis (MFA)  was performed to equalize the influence of both groups of selected variables, which enabled the use of factors as new predictors of severity.

For the DBPCFC and first accident scores, we thought it made more sense to compute the factors using only the discriminant variables rather than using all available variables. Indeed, the predictive model needed to be built with a reasonable number of characters. Even if a limited number of factors were chosen afterwards, all variables would still have to be measured to compute the factors. Moreover, a non-discriminant variable could have a large coefficient for some retained factors even though it would not improve the overall discriminative power of the model. Nonetheless, we did compute factors using all variables as well, but the results did not improve the discrimination of the first accident score. For the eliciting dose, factors were computed using all 34 available variables, not only the discriminant ones.

Thus the four classes considered here are for scores of {1}, {2}, {3}, and {4, 5}. Well-classification rates obtained by fourth-fold cross-validation with each statistical approach are shown in Table 3. The percentage of patients of score 4 who were correctly classified in class 4 is also given. Note that direct application of the classifiers could not have been performed since the number of variables was greater than the size of the learning sets. 5\u2212NN combined with our specific variable selection scheme was the most performant classifier with 41% of well-classified patients, since stepwise logistic regression and penalized SVM did not give better results. Nevertheless all these results remained poor. Replacing variables by factors did not give better results than direct use of the variables. On the whole dataset 7 variables had a Kruskal-Wallis p-value lower than 0.10 (peanut, walnut, chick pea, pecan nut, broad bean, green pea, cashew nut, ordered by increasing p-value, Table 6) and 8 were retained in the Wilks' lambda selection (chick pea, specific IgE to rAra-h8, green pea, rape seed, peanut, ribwort, total IgE, specific IgE to rAra-h1, Table 7). Thus 12 different variables were selected in total (3 immunoassays and 9 SPTs). Two-class study The methodology used was the same as for the four-class study. The method which gave the best results for two-class discrimination was 1\u2212NN with factors computed from discriminant variables as predictors (81% of well-classified sample points) (Table 3). Of the score 4 patients, 74% were correctly classified. Contrary to the four-class study, the use of factors improved the classification rates compared to the direct use of variables since using selected variables with 1\u2212NN gave 79% of well-classification rate. The other models yielded poor results. Processing the variable selection on the whole dataset gave interesting results. Eleven different variables were selected to build discriminant factors: peanut, walnut, specific IgE to rAra-h1, specific IgE to rAra-h3, pecan nut for Kruskal-Wallis and peanut, specific IgE to rAra-h1, lupine flour, specific IgE to rAra-h2, ribwort, Dpte, birch, dog epithelia for Wilks' lambda. These immunoassays, as well as SPTs to nuts and legumes, are variables expected by clinicians. This indicates that our selection process seems to detect \"useful\" variables.

Previous studies were aimed at finding links between immunoassays or SPTs and allergy severity, but their statistical analyses were limited to either comparing distributions between groups of patients (using, for instance, the Mann-Whitney test) or to computing linear correlation coefficients. In our approach, we used several classification rules to aid in comparing and choosing the optimal and most efficient method. It appeared that in general selecting discriminant variables by a process independent from classification gave better results. In addition, we found that using MFA to compute new predictors was an attractive solution when equalizing the weights of group variables, and we proposed a novel algorithm for simultaneously clustering the levels of ordinal qualitative variables and for selecting discriminant variables. Our work differs from earlier studies in several respects. Previous studies were performed on small sample sizes of 30 to 40 patients  using a small number of measured variables, which only permitted a limited choice of discriminating predictors. Also, specific IgE to Ara-h1,2,3 were measured by SPTs instead of immunoassays  and although a positive response to an SPT does indeed indicate allergen sensitivity, it is still less accurate than immunoassays. There are several scoring methods in the literature to evaluate peanut allergy severity. For example, Hourihane et al. devised a complex 25-class scoring system combining observed reactions and eliciting doses . A graduation of symptoms was also proposed by M\u00fcller , but this score is based on allergic reactions in response to bee or wasp venom (and not peanut allergens). Thus, developing a standardized scoring method is still necessary and would facilitate comparison studies from different centers. One possible solution would be comparing the results of Hourihane et al.'s score with the one used in this study using the same cohort of patients. Moreover, the large number of scoring levels in Hourihane et al.'s approach could be reduced by our algorithm. Nevertheless, several potential biases in our study must be noted. First, SPT diameters are relatively imprecise. There is no standard method of measuring SPT reaction since both wheal diameters and areas are popular metrics . Additionally, the score of the first accident can be inaccurate or imprecise since it depends on the medical history of the patient, and hence subject to inaccuracies in the patient's memory which may underestimate symptom severity. Other factors such as medication can affect the first reaction symptoms as well  yielding a severity score higher than it should be. Finally, the first exposure score is a past event predicted using variables measured during a subsequent DBPCFC. As mentioned in Section 4.2.2, Hourihane et al. also used such a reverse prediction with a community score that was evaluated a posteriori using the record file of the patient . The predictive models used in our study yielded correct classifications for the first accidental exposure and DBPCFC of up to 81% and 66% for the two-class study. Our algorithm also allowed us to group eliciting dose values and to select discriminant predictors, leading to an 77% classification rate for the two-class study. This indicates that it is indeed possible to correctly predict peanut allergy severity by measuring well-chosen variables. Considering that all immunoassays of specific IgE were selected once, we also hypothesize that measuring new antibodies to peanut allergens, such as those directed against rArah-6, rArah-7 and rArah-9, will further improve the discriminative power of our models. This also argues for these antibodies playing key roles in the diagnosis of peanut allergy severity. Our variable selection process also offers a new perspective on conducting allergy checkups. Indeed, some unexpected variables appeared several times in our models, such as SPTs to dog epithelia as shown in Figure 4. If future experiments could distinguish the medical relevance of this observation from cross-reactivity, then the importance of these SPTs in discriminating severity would be confirmed. Besides, some SPTs never appeared in our models, such as SPTs to Alternaria or Brazil nut, and thus should no longer be performed in practice when diagnosing peanut allergy severity. Furthermore, some SPTs with proven cross-reactivity to peanuts were retained in our models, such as lupine flour , indicating that our results were in line with other medical discoveries. The discriminating models described in this paper are a first step towards a simple, safe and efficient diagnosis of peanut allergy severity by quantifying antibodies. Before being applied in clinical practices, they must first be validated on an independent set of patients. New variables must also be added as additional predictors toward improving successful classification rates. These models could then become practical tools for clinicians. When scoring severity, the clinical test results could be reported online at the allergy vigilance network (R\u00e9seau d'allergovigilance, http://www.cicbaa.com/ ), or a simple statistical software could be programmed.

Each night the radial velocity was measured from the average of about 15 consecutive independent radial velocity estimates (computed from different spectra) taken during a period of \u223c20 minutes. This methodology makes it possible to average the radial-velocity variations due to stellar oscillations ( Mayor et al. 2003)-see also Bouchy et al. (in prep.). As seen in Fig. 1, the measurements done during the first 8 nights (when the star was followed during the whole night) have a considerable lower rms around the best keplerian fit than the following measurements. This scatter results from the photon noise error (\u223c20 cm s \u22121 ), the calibration uncertainty (\u223c40 cm s \u22121 ), and from the stellar noise (\u223c80 cm s \u22121 ) that is not completely averaged on the nights with only 15 radial velocity measurements (Bouchy et al., in prep.)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Once this core reaches a critical mass (m crit ), accretion of gas in a runaway fashion becomes possible and the mass of the planet increases rapidly (e.g. Ida & Lin 2004b). This therefore implies that the current object has never reached the critical mass, for otherwise the planet would have become much more massive. Furthermore, recent giant planet formation models including disk evolution and migration ( Alibert et al. 2004) have shown that these effects greatly shorten the formation time. Hence, it is unlikely that the planet has migrated over large distances before reaching its present location. It was thus probably formed inside the ice radius (\u223c3.2 AU-Ida & Lin 2004a), and its composition should be dominated by rocky (telluric) material. We note that the high [Fe/H] of \u00b5 Ara makes this case possible (Ida & Lin 2004a).

It shows that the model is also able to predict tumor time-course, especially for these patients. For the 10% of patients for whom predictions of minimal tumor size were incorrect, we observed that, for four of them, tumor size reduction was unexpectedly characterized by two phases: an initial moderate decrease in tumor size within the first 5 months of treatment, followed by a more pronounced decrease after 5 months. For these four patients, the model underevaluated the response. Inclusion of a second MTD observation (obtained after 5 months of treatment) yielded correct minimal tumor size predictions for these patients. Tumor response for one additional patient could not be predicted owing to his/her prolonged response to treatment (more than 40 months). The model may not be able to capture such extreme behavior. We then performed predictive analysis on the 43 \"external\" patients. The model successfully predicted the minimal tumor size for 75% of these patients (bias 24.41 mm (-7.14, 21.67)).

When we incorporated genetic statuses, predictive capacity rose to 87% (bias 0.31 mm (-0.86, 1.49)).

Mechanisms of acquired resistance can be pharmacological resulting from decreased drug uptake into the cell, intracellular drug inactivation, or repair of drug-induced damages. This is the case of the LGG response to TMZ, for which it has been shown that more than90% of recurrent gliomas show no response to a second treatment with TMZ. One of the key elements in TMZ resistance is MGMT, an enzymatic protein with the faculty to repair the principal O 6meG-alkylation site to TMZ, thus resulting in decreased efficacy of drugs during treatment. MGMT could not be tested as a covariate in our model since for most patients only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was available for DNA tests, whereas MGMT methylation testing ideally needs frozen tissue. Of note, resistance to TMZ is also responsible for significant therapeutic failures in melanoma. Following this biological knowledge, we modeled acquisition of resistance by decreasing drug efficacy on LGG proliferative tissue with time following therapy onset. Since all patients received the same TMZ doses with the same scheduling, we believe that modeling resistance as a function of actual drug exposure would not have led to significantly different results. For identifiability reasons, we could not model all transitions between the three compartments, especially the possibility for quiescent cells to directly return into proliferation, as it could occur without treatment. However, during treatment quiescent cells do have the capacity to repair their DNA and become proliferative. Therefore, this model is a relevant tool to characterize tumor response to TMZ but does not aim to faithfully mimic natural tumor growth. Our model is flexible enough to reproduce the variability of patients' response to standard TMZ protocol and has the capacity to mimic both tumor regrowth during treatment as a result of acquired resistance to TMZ and prolonged response to treatment. Finally, our model could constitute a rational tool to optimize the duration of temozolomide therapy in low-grade glioma patients. Up to now, there are no clear rules or guidelines regarding the optimal number of cycles or treatment duration in patients treated with TMZ.  Many neurooncologists prolong the duration of the treatment beyond 12 cycles if an ongoing decrease in tumor size is observed at this time. However, there are downsides to prolonging TMZ treatment, including side effects and costs. An even greater concern is that TMZ therapy might drive the evolutionary path to high-grade glioma.

Counts were converted to fluxes using instrumental zero points using the same method as used for WISE catalog source data (Wright et al. 2010). The background was estimated and subtracted using the modal value in an aperture of at least 1.4square arcminutes located \u2265 1\u2032 from the nucleus, and far from the coma. The dominant source of error is the uncertainty on the absolute calibration. We fit a reflected light model to the observed data at 3.4\u00b5m, making the assumption that the flux observed is due to reflected light from dust grains, the grains have a neutral reflectance. The reflected light is thus effectively the solar flux scaled to the 3.4\u00b5m signal. We neglected light reflected or emitted by the nucleus, the size of which is unknown at this time because it has been obscured by dust since discovery. If the nucleus is on the order of 1km in radius, it would contribute a few tenths of a \u00b5Jy to the fluxes observed during the 2014 Jan. visit when the comet was least active and the nucleus likely contributed the largest fraction of the light. This is significantly less than the uncertainty in the flux measurements and we conclude that the nucleus contributes a negligible amount of light. We also computed a theoretical thermal contribution to the flux by calculating the blackbody radiation that would be emitted by the quantity of dust estimated from the 3.4\u00b5m flux. We used a Planck function and assumed an emissivity\u223c0.9, so that the temperature of the grains scaled as 286K \u00d7 r \u22121/2 H . It is entirely possible that the grain spectral energy distribution is more complicated, but the singular data point at 3.4\u00b5m only allows for a simplified dust model constraint.

We estimate the uncertainties on our measurements by examining the spread of results obtained when using apertures of radii 9, 11, and 22\u2032\u2032 since, ideally, the quantity calculated should be independent of chosen aperture size. However, it is quite possible that the spread in these values may in part be due to non-ideallized behavior, i.e. that the coma flux does not drop off as \u03c1 \u22121.

Results: CTC and CEC levels were not correlated in the 67 patients included. At baseline, CTC positivity was a significant prognostic marker for TtP at a threshold of 3 CTC/7.5 ml (P < 0.05) but not at 5 CTC/7.5 ml (P = 0.09). Baseline CEC levels (median 17 CEC/4 ml, range 1-769) were associated with age \u202145 years (P = 0.01), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (P < 0.01) and not with TtP at any threshold. Changes of CTC count during treatment were not a surrogate of TtP, with any of the model tested (threshold based or relative decrease in percent). However, increase in CEC count was associated with improved TtP, at the threshold of 20 CEC/4 ml (P < 0.01).

Beyond biological characterization of the metastatic process, disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection can be used in a few clinical settings as a prognostic factor and/or as an early surrogate marker of treatment response. In patients with metastatic breast cancer, it has been reported that DTC detection was not clinically relevant, whereas CTC detection was of prognostic significance . Currently, the most commonly used detection system in this setting is the automated and standardized CellSearch\u00d2 assay , which has a validated reproducibility . In a pivotal study reported by Cristofanilli et al. in 2004 , CTCs were screened by this system in patients who received hormonal treatments or chemotherapy as first-or second-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In patients under standard chemotherapy, CTC positivity at baseline was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS; 2.7 versus 7.0 months; P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS; 10.1 versus >18 months; P < 0.001). CTC positivity was defined in a training set (n = 102 patients) and validated in another set of patients (n = 75 patients). Three weeks after the start of the treatment, CTC status was also independently associated with PFS (2.1 versus 7.0 months; P < 0.001) and OS (8.2 versus >18 months; P < 0.001). In the same series, other studies reported that CTC detection was poorly correlated to the CA 27-29 serum marker nor to the tumor burden . The threshold of 5 CTC/7.5 ml for CTC positivity and its association with clinical outcome have been confirmed in 80 patients treated with standard chemotherapy at the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy) , and in another 74 American patients . However, the clinical benefit of using CTC count as an early surrogate marker of response and/or time to progression (TtP) under treatment has not yet been demonstrated prospectively, explaining why American Society of Clinical Oncology has not recommended its use ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

According to MO19391 study end points, TtP was measured from the time treatment began to the time documented progression occurred (i.e. not taking into account deaths occurring before tumor progression). Tumor response to treatment was evaluated as per standard of care and included complete and partial responses. Initially, the \u20215-CTC/7.5 ml threshold was used to define CTC positivity (for Table 1). The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was applied for dichotomous and categorical data, and the Student's t-test or analysis of variance was used to compare continuous variables between groups. For comparison of quantitative parameters, if the normality hypothesis was not fulfilled, nonparametric tests were used as Wilcoxon test or Kruskall-Wallis test. Signed rank test was used to compare quantitative parameter between baseline and before C3. Correlation between CTCs and CECs was studied using linear regression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyze TtP for each group of interest defined by CEC or CTC thresholds, and Cox regression model was used to provide the hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval (CI). To correlate CTC and CEC changes under treatment with tumor response, two models were used: threshold-based and relative change-based models, the latter considering CTCs and CECs as continuous variables. Threshold-based models divided patients into four classes . For TtP analysis, in the threshold-based models, Wald test (provided by Cox model regression) compared TtP of patients classified according to their positivity status before C3, this analysis being stratified on patient's baseline status. Relative change-based model divided patients into two classes: patients with relative change (between baseline and before C3) above a threshold and patients with relative change below this threshold. For TtP prediction by CTC/CEC counts, this article reports every test made. Two-tailed P values <0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS\u00d2 9.1.3 software. results patients Sixty-seven patients have been included, of whom 63 patients (94%) had a metastatic disease and 4 patients (6%) a nonoperable locoregional relapse. Fifty-five patients (82%) received prior chemotherapy for localized breast cancer. The patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Only two patients had a HER2-positive breast cancer, as targeted anti-HER2 treatment was not authorized in this study. Main metastatic sites were bone (n = 37, 55%), liver (n = 24, 36%) and lungs (n = 21, 31%). Chemotherapy regimens associated with bevacizumab, were mostly docetaxel and paclitaxel as single agents (n = 27 and 16 patients, respectively). The median number of bevacizumab cycles received was 10 (range 1-27); however, 11 patients (19%) discontinued bevacizumab before the fourth cycle. After a median duration of follow-up of 8.8 months (range 0.4-14.7), the median TtP was 11.9 months (95% CI 8.3 to not reached).

At baseline, CTC prognostic value was assessed using different thresholds to define CTC positivity (Table 2). In this serial, using the \u20215 CTC/7.5 ml threshold to define CTC positivity, CTC status was not predictive of tumor response (P = 0.11) nor of TtP (P = 0.09). However, among the different thresholds tested (Table 2), a threshold of \u20213 CTC/7.5 ml was a significant predictor of both tumor response and TtP (Figure 1; P < 0.05). At baseline, CEC count was not associated with tumor response or TtP, at any threshold (Table 2). We further studied whether CTC and CEC count changes under treatment may be correlated with tumor response and used as an early surrogate of TtP. Results are shown in Table 3. Strikingly, focusing on CTC count, all threshold-based and relative change-based models failed to accurately predict tumor response or TtP. On the contrary, TtP was significantly associated with CEC changes, using the threshold-based model, at the threshold of \u202120 CEC/4 ml (P < 0.01; Table 3; see also Figure 2A).

Moreover, the fact that we do describe in our series the significant correlations of CTC positivity ( \u20215 CTC/ 7.5 ml) with high CA 15-3 serum marker and with bone metastatic site, which have been also reported by Nole et al.  and De Giorgi et al. , does not support a lack of power of our study. The lack of clinical relevance of CTC changes during treatment might also be due to the difference in the CTC count schedule, as it was before C2 (i.e. theoretically at day 21) in the study by Cristofanilli et al. , at day 30 in the study of Nole et al.  and before C3 (i.e. theoretically at day 42) in our study. However, a recent retrospective study of the series by Cristofanilli's group showed that later CTC count (i.e. between day 56 and day 91) retained a strong  prognostic relevance in patients treated by standard chemotherapy alone . We therefore favor the hypothesis that the lack of CTC significance during treatment is directly related to the systematic use of bevacizumab in our homogeneously treated series of patients. In our study, CTC counts were in line with previous studies at baseline but unusually low after two cycles of treatment compared with previous studies (without bevacizumab): 12% of patients had \u20215 CTC/7.5 ml here (day 42) versus 30% (day 30)  or 22% (day 42-56) . Besides a hypothetical direct anti-CTC effect of bevacizumab, two possible explanations should be discussed. First, bevacizumab gained its worldwide regulatory approval after the demonstration of a significant prolongation in PFS, leading to its use as a standard for first-line treatment . Importantly, it is highly probable that the intrinsic properties of CTC positivity, defined by a precise threshold (here, \u20215 CTC/7.5 ml was initially tested) and used as an early surrogate test of PFS, will strongly depend on the length of the PFS obtained by treatments, which are continuously improved. In other words, the \u20215 CTC/7.5 ml threshold which successfully separated early (median: 2.1 months) from late (7.0 months) progressive disease under standard chemotherapy will necessarily be challenged by the improvement of PFS due to new treatments such as bevacizumab (or trastuzumab, not used here and not reported in the series by Cristofanilli et al.). Accordingly, our results indicate that the CTC positivity threshold should be \u20213 CTC/7.5 ml rather than \u20215 CTC/7.5 ml, when used for prognostic purpose at baseline in our setting. Secondly, we also suggest that the use of bevacizumab may change the intravasation abilities of cancer cells, due to its effect on the vessels endothelium. For comparison purposes, in colorectal cancer studies, 56% and 100% of patients were treated with bevacizumab in the studies by Cohen et al. (n = 430 patients)  and Tol et al. (n = 467 patients)  studies, respectively. These two studies exhibited a similar baseline CTC positivity rate. However, CTC positivity rates reported under treatment were rather different (12% versus 5% at 5-6 weeks), inversely correlated with bevacizumab use. Intravasation impairment is a hypothesis to explain why CTC counts dropped off under treatment. This hypothesis may explain how CTC count (i) retains a significant prognostic value at baseline, as already described in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy ; but (ii) has less individual significance as an early surrogate marker of TtP when assessed under treatment. The impact of bevacizumab on tumoral vessels has been reported in many ways since the original report of bevacizumab use in rectal cancers but our analysis is the first, to our knowledge, to indicate that it may impair tumor cell intravasation in patients."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

To further complicate the survey on CECs, these cells can be divided into mature CECs and progenitor CECs, whereas some chemotherapy regimens (metronomic chemotherapy) are believed to exert antiangiogenic effects beyond their cytotoxic effects. More recently, it has also been shown that some standard chemotherapies (especially taxanes) have a stimulating effect on an endothelial progenitor which supports their combined use with an antiangiogenic agent . CEC sorting by the CellSearch\u00d2 system is based on a CD146(+), CD105(+), DAPI (+) and CD45 (2) phenotypes of CECs . It has been also validated through gene expression profiling which verified that expression of endothelial genes such as vascular endothelial cadherin was present in the population of sorted cells . Our analysis is the first to report that CEC count, by the CellSearch\u00d2 automated system, could be a significant early surrogate marker of TtP for breast cancer patients treated by bevacizumab combined with standard chemotherapy. Among many models tested, three could be compared in a validation study: (i) a threshold-based model ( \u202120 CEC/4 ml); (ii) a relative variation model (+50%), both using the two CEC counts (baseline and day 42); and (iii) a threshold-based model at day 42 ( \u202120 CEC/4 ml). Interestingly, the barely lower statistical significance of the nearby thresholds of \u202125 CEC/4 ml and \u202115 CEC/4 ml (P < 0.05 and P = 0.07, respectively) strongly indicated that the statistical significance of the \u202120 CEC/4 ml threshold was not due to a random multiple testing artifact.

As some of these planets are of terrestrial nature, the hope of identifying Earth analogs has lead to considerable advances toward the detection of possibly habitable worlds (Borucki 2011;Fordetal.2012). Even though quite frequent in the solar neighborhood (Kiseleva-Eggleton & Eggleton 2001), not many attempts have yet been made to specifically target binary stars in this endeavor.

While still well within measurement uncertainties, the deviation of the maximum RV amplitude (V max r ) from the observed value is larger than that of V circ r. On the one hand, this might indicate that the planet is currently in an orbital evolution phase where its eccentricity is almost zero. On the other hand, the planet may be too close to its host star for our model to predict V max r correctly.

(2012). We refer the reader to that article for more details. Figures 3 and 4 show the application of the proposed habitability classification scheme to the \u03b1 Centauri system. In these figures, blue denotes PHZs, green shows EHZs, and yellow corresponds to AHZs. The red areas in Figures 3 and 4 are uninhabitable, and purple stands for dynamically unstable regions. Table 1 shows the physical properties of the system. We used the formulae by Underwood et al. (2003) to calculate S I and S O for the given effective temperatures of \u03b1 Cen A and B. In general, these formulae allow for extending the analytic estimates for HZs, as given by Eggl et al. (2012), to main-sequence stars with different spectral types. Runaway greenhouse and maximum greenhouse insolation limits were used to determine the inner and outer boundaries of HZs, respectively. In the bottom panels, the vertical lines represent areas of equal rms amplitudes, \ud97b\udf59\ud97b\udf59\u03c1\ud97b\udf59\ud97b\udf59 M,\u03c9. One can see that planetary orbits with dynamically enhanced eccentricities can have smaller semimajor axes and still produce similarly high astrometric amplitudes as circular orbits which are more distant from the host star. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the locations of the HZs and the detectability of habitable planets in those regions depend strongly on the eccentricity of the binary (e b ). The actual eccentricity of the \u03b1 Centauri system is denoted by a horizontal line at e b =0.5179. The values for the borders of the different HZs using \u03b1 Centauri's actual eccentricity are listed in Table 3. As shown here, both stars permit dynamical stability for habitable, Earth-like planets. Due to the difference in stellar luminosities, the HZs around \u03b1 Cen A are larger and farther away from the host star compared to \u03b1 Cen B. Since the binary's mass ratio is close to 0.45, the gravitational influence of \u03b1 Cen B is more pronounced on the PHZ of \u03b1 Cen A. This is a consequence of the larger injected planetary eccentricities (e p ) as can be seen from the top row of Figure 5. The relatively larger gravitational influence of \u03b1 Cen B onto the HZ of \u03b1 Cen A is also mirrored in the fact that the region of dynamical instability (meshed, purple online) reaches toward lower binary eccentricities. The change in the range and configuration of HZs with the change in planetary semimajor axis and eccentricity of the binary is pronounced. A clear shrinking trend for PHZ and EHZ can be observed for high values of the binary's eccentricity. While as shown by Eggl et al. (2012), the AHZ in general expands slightly when the eccentricity is enhanced, Figures 3 and 4 show that in the \u03b1 Centauri system, this HZ depends only weakly on e b , making it the closest approximation to the classical HZ as defined by Kasting et al. (1993). Comparing these results with the existing studies on the HZs for \u03b1 Cen B such as Guedes et al. (2008) and Forgan (2012), one can see that the values of the inner boundaries of the HZs around \u03b1 Cen B as given in Figures 3 and 4 coincide well with the previous studies. Forgan (2012) even found a similar shrinking trend with higher planetary eccentricity. Yet, Forgan (2012) did not take the actual coupling between the planet's eccentricity and the binary's orbit into account. The limits for the outer boundaries of HZ in our model are different from the ones in Forgan (2012) since different climatic assumptions were made. In this work, we used insolation limits for atmospheric collapse assuming a maximum greenhouse atmosphere ( Kasting et al. 1993) whereas Forgan (2012) focused on emergence from snowball states."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

In addition to the habitability maps discussed in Section 5.2, Figures 3 and 4 show the results regarding the peak and rms strength of the RV and astrometric signals. Here, the aim is to illustrate how the different types of HZs presented in Section 5.2, as well as the maximum and rms signal strengths defined in Section 2 vary with the binary's eccentricity (e b ) and planetary semimajor axis (a p ). The left column of almost coincide. The same holds true for \u03c1 max and \u03c1 circ in this case. Yet, V max r and \u03c1 max grow with the binary's eccentricity. The corresponding contour lines indicate that for high binary eccentricities even small planetary semimajor axes can produce similar AM peak signal strengths. Similarly, planets with larger distances to their host stars can still cause similar RV amplitudes if the binary's eccentricity is sufficiently large. If a fixed detection limit is set, e.g., V r =9.5m/s, planets with semimajor axes up to 1.5A U could still be found around stars similar to \u03b1 Cen A, assuming a binary eccentricity of e b = 0.7. To produce a similarly high RV amplitude, a circular planet has to orbit its host star at roughly 0.8 AU (Figure 3). In other words, high binary eccentricities lead to excited planetary eccentricities which in turn increase the peak signal strengths suggesting that binary-planet interactions can actually improve the chances for detecting terrestrial planets. Naturally, if the planet's eccentricity happens to be close to zero at the time of observation, this advantage is nullified."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

If such a system hosted a transiting terrestrial planet, TD values would range around55 ppm for \u03b1 Cen A, and 115 ppm for \u03b1 Cen B. Such transit depths are detectable by NASA's Kepler telescope for instance-stellar and instrumental sources included-as the spacecraft's median noise level amounts to \u224829 ppm ( Gilliland et al. 2011). Therefore, Earth-like planets could in theory be found around \u03b1 Centauri stars. However, Kepler was not designed to observe stars with apparent magnitudes between 0 and 3 such as those of \u03b1 Centauri. The Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite mission, for instance, will aim for TP of brighter stars ( Ricker et al. 2010). Nevertheless, the example of Kepler suggests that the detection of transiting habitable planets in S-type systems would be possible using current technology. In fact, very much similar to the cases discussed in the previous section, the orbit forcing that an Earth-like planet experiences in a binary star system may enhance its possibility of detection via TP (Kane & von Braun 2008;Kane et al. 2012;Borkovits et al. 2003;Schneider 1994; also see Figure 7).

However, obtaining sufficient data to reconstruct the planetary signal requires a great amount of dedicated observing time (approximately five years in their example).

One prominent example is the imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (ImGP-S), a bi-enzyme complex which belongs to the family of glutamine amidotransferases and constitutes a branch-point connecting amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis. ImGP-S consists of the cyclase subunit HisF and the glutaminase subunit HisH. HisF binds the substrate PRFAR and performs a cycloligase/lyase reaction that generates ImGP and AICAR, which are further used in histidine and de novo purine biosynthesis, respectively  ( Figure 1).

This channeling hampers diffusion of ammonia into bulk solvent and thus presumably prevents its protonation to the non-productive ammonium ion. Another special feature of the HisF/HisH complex is the tight coordination of the two enzymatic activities: Binding of PRFAR (or its analogue N\u2032[(5\u2032-phosphoribosyl) formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4carboxamide-ribonucleotide; ProFAR) to HisF results in an allosteric signal that leads to a several hundred-fold stimulation of the glutaminase activity of HisH  .

To this end, a set of 87 extant HisF and HisH proteins from the seven phylogenetic clades Crenarchaeota, Actinobacteria, Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Thermotogae has been used to determine a phylogenetic tree t HisF_HisH based on the CAT model  ( Figure 1).

The synthase subunit HisF catalyzes the reaction of N`-[(5`phosphoribulosyl)formimino]-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-ribonucleotide (PRFAR) with ammonia (NH 3 ) to imidazole glycerol phosphate (ImGP) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR). ImGP is further utilized in the synthesis of histidine, whereas AICAR is an intermediate in de novo purine biosynthesis, rendering HisF a branch-point enzyme of amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis. The ammonia molecule required for the HisF reaction is produced by the glutaminase subunit HisH (catalytic triad residues are depicted as spheres) and subsequently channeled to the active site of HisF (catalytic aspartate residues are depicted as spheres). In the absence of HisH, HisF can also use external ammonia that is added as ammonia salts. HisF adopts the (\uf062\uf061) 8-barrel fold, an ubiquitous and catalytically versatile protein architecture  , which is considered one of the three most ancient protein folds  . HisH adopts the \uf061\uf02f\uf062 hydrolase fold  . superkingdoms is still under debate  , LUCA-HisF is among the oldest so far reconstructed proteins, if not the oldest hitherto calculated predecessor  . Among the 87 descendants of LUCA-HisF used for reconstruction, 78 of the 250 residues are less than 50 % conserved, whereas 49 residues are strongly conserved.

The gene coding for LUCA-HisF was optimized for its expression in E. coli, synthesized (GeneArt), and cloned into the vector pET24a(+)(Stratagene) using the terminal restriction sites for NdeI and XhoI. Since the addition of a C-terminal hexahistidine tag to LUCA-HisF might influence its interaction with HisH proteins, a stop codon was integrated at the end of the gene. The gene was expressed in E. coli T7-Express cells (New England Biolabs) transformed with pET24a(+)LUCA-hisF. To this end,four liters of Luria Broth (LB) medium supplemented with 75 \u00b5g/ml kanamycin were inoculated with a pre-culture and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. After an OD 600 of 0.6 was reached, the temperature was lowered to 30 \u00b0C. Expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG, and growth was continued overnight.

The glutaminase activity of zmHisH (1 \u00b5M) in complex with liganded LUCA-HisF (2 \u00b5M; 40 \u00b5M ProFAR) was measured in a coupled enzymatic assay as previously described  . At 25 \u00b0C, produced glutamate was oxidized by a molar excess of glutamate dehydrogenase (Roche) in 50 mM Tricine hydroxide, pH 8.0. Thus, the reduction of the coenzyme NAD + to NADH could be monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Three glutamine saturation curves were recorded and fitted with the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain k cat and K M Gln. In an identical setup, no glutaminase activity (12 mM glutamine) could be detected for LUCA-HisH (20 \u00b5M) in complex with ligand-bound LUCA-HisF (20 \u00b5M; 200 \u00b5M ProFAR). The extent to which LUCA-HisF liganded with ProFAR activates zmHisH had to be determined in a discontinuous assay, since NAD + also exhibits a stimulating effect on glutaminase activity  . To this end, 10 mM glutamine were incubated at 25 \u00b0C with 0.5 \u00b5M zmHisH and 5 \u00b5M LUCA-HisF either in the absence of ProFAR or in the presence of 40 \u00b5M ProFAR. 150 \u00b5l aliquots of the reaction mixture were collected after , , 153045 and 60 (only in the absence of ProFAR) minutes and spun through a 10 kDa filter (Roth) to remove the enzymes. The stimulation factor is the quotient k cat (ProFAR saturated)/ k cat (without ProFAR) v max was calculated from the linear increase of glutamate production with time, which was determined with the help of 1 mg/ml glutamate dehydrogenase and 0.7 mM APAD + (Sigma) (the reaction mixture was diluted 1:7.5, and absorption was measured at 363 nm). All measurements were performed in triplicates. ProFAR to PRFAR isomerisation activity (HisA reaction) was measured with the enzymatic assay described for the ammonia-dependent HisF reaction, however in presence of an excess of HisF 46 . PRA to CdRP isomerisation activity (TrpF reaction) was followed at 25 \u00b0C by a fluorimetric assay (excitation at 350 nm, emission at 400 nm)  . The substrate PRA was generated in situ by 1 \u00b5M yeast anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase from anthranilate and PRPP, which was provided in a 30-fold molar excess. Moreover, 2.5 \u00b5M indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase from T. maritima were added to prevent product inhibition. To test for enzymatic activity in vivo, the gene coding for LUCA-HisF was subcloned into the pTNA vector, which allows for constitutive expression in E. coli  . The resulting pTNA-LUCA-hisF plasmid was used to transform cells of auxotrophic \uf044hisF, \uf044hisA or \uf044trpF E. coli strains  . These strains lack the hisF, hisA, or trpF gene on their chromosome and are, therefore, unable to grow on medium without histidine or tryptophan, respectively.

The gene coding for LUCA-HisF was synthesized, cloned into a plasmid, and expressed in E. coli. The LUCA-HisF protein was predominantly found in the soluble fraction of the host cell extract, and purified in athree step process using ion exchange chromatography, ammonia sulfate precipitation, and size exclusion chromatography. Purified LUCA-HisF was crystallized and its three-dimensional structure was determined at 1.48 \u00c5 resolution by molecular replacement based on the structure of tmHisF  ( Figure 2, Table S1). LUCA-HisF (PDB ID 4EVZ) adopts the conserved (\uf062\uf061) 8-barrel structure observed in the three extant HisF proteins from Pyrobaculum aerophilum (PDB ID 1H5Y), Thermus thermophilus (PDB ID 1KA9), and T. maritima (PDB ID 1THF), for which crystal structures have been previously determined. The superposition of LUCA-HisF with each of these structures by means of STAMP  resulted in an overall root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) ranging from 1.14 \u00c5 to 1.43 \u00c5. In agreement with the postulated evolution of the (\uf062\uf061) 8-barrel fold from a (\uf062\uf061) 4half-barrel  , LUCA-HisF displays a clear two-fold symmetry: The superposition of its N-terminal and Cterminal halves yielded an RMSD of 1.68 \u00c5, which is similar to the corresponding values for the three extant HisF proteins (1.27 \u00c5 for 1H5Y, 1.52 \u00c5 for 1KA9, and 1.69 \u00c5 for 1THF). Consistent with the internal symmetry, the two catalytically important aspartate residues  are found on opposite sides of the active site at the C-terminal ends of \u03b2-strand 1 and \u03b2-strand 5. Likewise, the two co-crystallized phosphate groups, which represent the two phosphate groups of the substrate PRFAR (Figure 1), are anchored by the C-terminal ends of \u03b2-strands 3 and 4, and \u03b2-strands 7 and 8, respectively (Figure 2A). Moreover, a stabilizing salt-bridge cluster at the N-terminal end of the \u03b2-barrel, which contains four charged and invariant residues, which form the gate to the cyclase ammonia channel , is also present in LUCA-HisF ( Figure 2B)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

The thermal stability of LUCA-HisF was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which monitors overall unfolding, and the heat-induced decrease of the far-UV CD signal, which indicates the loss of secondary structure. The combination of both methods showed that thermal unfolding of LUCA-HisF is atwo-step process with apparent transition Figure 3.

Interestingly, even higher denaturation temperatures were previously observed for enzymes from the common ancestors of Bacteria, Archaea and Archaea/Eukaryota .

LUCA-HisF has a lower \uf044G D but a comparably high mvalue as tmHisF and its artificially designed precursors Sym1 and Sym2  , indicating that it is comparably compact as these proteins but less stable ( Figure S4A, Table S2). Folding and unfolding kinetics followed by Tyr/Trp fluorescence, showed that the reduced stability of LUCA-HisF is due to strongly increased unfolding rates of LUCA-HisF in comparison to tmHisF ( Figure S5A). The comparison of the refolding kinetics of LUCA-HisF, tmHisF, Sym1, and Sym2 followed by fluorescence and far-UV CD (Supporting Information) showed that all four proteins share a common sequential folding mechanism including a non-productive burst-phase intermediate ( Figure S4B) and two productive intermediates ( Figure S5). The rate-limiting step that synchronizes folding is conserved ( Figure S6). (Table 1). As ancient enzymes have been proposed to be less specific (more promiscuous) than their modern descendants 57 , we tested LUCA-HisF for its ability to catalyze related metabolic reactions. The homologous enzyme HisA, which precedes HisF in the histidine biosynthesis pathway, catalyzes the Amadori rearrangement of ProFAR to PRFAR. HisA shares with HisF the overall (\uf062\uf061) 8-barrel fold as well as the location of the two symmetry-related catalytic aspartate residues and phosphate binding sites  . Phosphoribosyl anthranilate (PRA) isomerase (TrpF) catalyzes an Amadori rearrangement in tryptophan biosynthesis analogous to HisA in histidine biosynthesis . Remarkably, a single amino acid exchange in the HisA and HisF proteins from T. maritima leads to TrpF activity, suggesting that these three phosphate-binding (\uf062\uf061) 8-barrel proteins have evolved from a common precursor  . We examined LUCA-HisF for the isomerisation activity towards ProFAR and PRA. However, no substrate turnover could be detected, even in the presence of 50 \u00b5M protein. These findings were complemented by assessing catalytic activity in vivo using metabolic selection. For this purpose, a plasmid harboring the LUCA-HisF gene was used to transform auxotrophic E. coli strains lacking either the intrinsic hisF, hisA, or trpF gene. When plated on minimal medium without histidine or tryptophan, the \uf044hisF cells formed visible colonies within 24 hours, whereas the \uf044hisA and \uf044trpF cells did not grow within one week.

This outcome confirms the functionality of the LUCA-HisF/zmHisH complex, as ammonia produced at the active site of HisH by means of glutamine hydrolysis is used as efficiently by LUCA-HisF as externally added ammonia. Moreover, this finding suggests that ammonia is transported from HisH to the active site of the synthase through a molecular channel formed by the central \uf062-barrel of HisF Figure 4.

A comparison between our results and the most current modeling of the ejection velocities suggests that impacts are possible only for millimeter to centimeter size particles released more than 13 au from the Sun. However, this level of cometary activity that far from the Sun is considered extremely unlikely. The arrival time of these particles spans a 20-minute time interval centered at October 19, 2014 at 20:09 TDB, i.e., around the time that Mars crosses the orbital plane of C/2013 A1. Ejection velocities larger than currently estimated by a factor > 2 would allow impacts for smaller particles ejected as close as 3 au from the Sun.

C/2013 A1 passes through the orbital plane of Mars69minutes before the close approach epoch, while Mars passes through the orbital plane of C/2013 A1 99minutes after the close approach. The Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) is the minimum distance between the orbit of the comet and the orbit of Mars (MOID, Gronchi et al. 2007). The MOID points on the two orbits are not on the line of nodes. Mars arrives at the minimum distance point 101min after the close approach epoch, while C/2013 A1 arrives at the minimum distance point 70min before the close approach, which means that the comet is 171min early for the minimum distance encounter. [Table 2 about here.] A standard tool to analyze planetary encounters is the b-plane (Kizner 1961; Valsecchi et al. 2003 ), defined as the plane passing through the center of mass of the planet and normal to the inbound hyperbolic approach asymptote. The coordinates on the b-plane described in Valsecchi et al. (2003) are oriented such that the projected heliocentric velocity of the planet is along \u2212\u03b6. Therefore , \u03b6 varies with the time of arrival, i.e., a positive \u03b6 means that the comet arrives late at the encounter while a negative \u03b6 means that the comet arrives early. On the other hand \u03be is related to the MOID. The b-plane is used on a daily basis for asteroid close approaches to the Earth and computing the corresponding impact probabilities (Milani et al. 2005).  The projection of the velocity of Mars on this plane is oriented as \u2212\u03b6, while the Mars-to-Sun vector projection is on the left side, at a counterclockwise angle of 186 \u00b0 with respect to the \u03be axis. The negative \u03b6 coordinate of the center of the ellipse corresponds to the 171min time shift between Mars and C/2013 A1.

A 3 values have an order of magnitude similar to that of A 2 . Figure 4 contains scatter plots of nongravitational parameters showing the correlation between these parameters.

Outside of this distance range we have no observations and therefore the uncertainty increases. Because of the fast decay of the g(r) function in Eq. (1) the contribution of nongravitational accelerations for large heliocentric distances is well within the uncertainty and so the trajectory of C/2013 A1 in the past is not significantly affected.

On the right side of the plot the required velocities are almost the same. This behavior makes sense as the closer we get to Mars the less time is available for solar radiation pressure to affect the trajectory. Therefore, the required ejection velocity is almost independent of the particle size and density. For \u03b2 =1.43 \u00d7 10 \u22124 we can see that the required velocity goes to zero for heliocentric distances around 22.5 au. The reason for this is that the curve on the b-plane defined by this particular value of \u03b2 passes through the center of Mars. Thus, if ejected at the right distance, i.e., 22.5 au, the particle reaches Mars under the action of solar radiation pressure, with no ejection velocity at all. It is also worth noticing that the \u03b2 = 0.1 curve does not go all the way back to 30 au because, for such a high \u03b2, solar radiation pressure is extremely strong and the particle does not even experience the close encounter with Mars if ejected too far in advance. [Figure 11 about here.] The results obtained so far can be used to assess the possibility that particles of a given size could reach Mars for a given ejection velocity model. For instance, the best fit for the ejection velocity according to Farnham As shown in Fig. 12, we can scale the required velocity to \u03b2 = 1 and make a comparison to the velocity given by (5). We can see that, according to this ejection velocity model, impacts are possible only for particles with \u03b2 \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 or smaller ejected at more than \u223c 16 au from the Sun. We conclude that impacts are possible only in one of these two unlikely cases: \u2022 millimeter to centimeter dust grains are ejected from the nucleus more than 13 au from the Sun; \u2022 the ejection velocities are larger than current estimates by a factor > 2. To analyze the risk posed by dust grains in the tail, we computed the required ejection velocities as a function of the heliocentric distance at which the particle is ejected and the particle's \u03b2 parameter, i.e., the ratio between solar radiation pressure and solar gravity. By comparing our results to the most updated modeling of dust grain ejection velocities, impacts are possible only for \u03b2 of the order of 10 \u22124 , which, for a density of 1g/cc, corresponds to millimeter to centimeter particles. However, the particles have to be ejected at more than 13 au, which is generally considered unlikely. See Kelley et al. (2014) As the comet gets closer to the inner solar system, new observations will be available and will allow better constraints on the dust grain ejection velocity profile. Our analysis can be used as a reference to quickly figure out what particles can reach Mars and the heliocentric distance at which they would have to have been ejected. In the unlikely case that future astrometry reveals unexpectedly large nongravitational perturbations, the required velocity to reach Mars for particles ejected within 2  au from the Sun can change and the presented analysis will need to be refined.

To allow for extended in-situ measurements, the spacecraft needs to be decelerated. One of the currently most promising technologies for deceleration is the magnetic sail which uses the deflection of interstellar matter via a magnetic field to decelerate the spacecraft. However, while the magnetic sail is very efficient at high velocities, its performance decreases with lower speeds. This leads to deceleration durations ofseveral decades depending on the spacecraft mass. Within the context of Project Dragonfly, initiated by the Initiative of Interstellar Studies (i4is), this paper proposes a novel concept for decelerating a spacecraft on an interstellar mission by combining a magnetic sail with an electric sail. Combining the sails compensates for each technologys shortcomings: A magnetic sail is more effective at higher velocities than the electric sail and vice versa. It is demonstrated that using both sails sequentially outperforms using only the magnetic or electric sail for various mission scenarios and velocity ranges, at a constant total spacecraft mass. For example, for decelerating from 5% c, to interplanetary velocities, a spacecraft with both sails needs about 29 years, whereas the electric sail alone would take 35 years and the magnetic sail about 40 years with a total spacecraft mass of 8250 kg. Furthermore, it is assessed how the combined deceleration system affects the optimal overall mission architecture for different spacecraft masses and cruising speeds. Future work would investigate how operating both systems in parallel instead of sequentially would affect its performance. Moreover, uncertainties in the density of interstellar matter and sail properties need to be explored."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

A higher spacecraft mass also increases the inertia of the system during deceleration and hence the time and distance required. An important indirect result stemming from Figure 6 is that high cruising speeds are not always optimal for a minimal mission duration. In the case of the4000 kg spacecraft, a 0.1 c cruising speed leads to a deceleration distance close to 2.5 light years. When taking into account that the distance to Alpha Centauri is 4.35 light years, one deduces that there are only 1.85 light years available for the acceleration and cruising phases.

In the previous sections, the requirement of the deceleration system mass being smaller thanten times the spacecraft mass was utilized. This boundary condition was introduced so that an easier comparison between different configurations could take place. In the present analysis however, the ratio between deceleration system mass and spacecraft mass was varied. The two spacecraft masses described in Section 6.1 as well as two different cases for the cruising speed were compared to each other. Figure 9 shows the results. An increased mass of the deceleration system leads, as expected, to a shorter deceleration duration. It is however notable, that the curves tend to saturate for larger masses. This implies that a larger deceleration mass, although having a great impact on the design of the acceleration phase because of additional inertia, only provides a small benefit to the overall deceleration performance. Quantitatively, taking the example of the 4000 kg spacecraft with 0.08 c cruising speed in Figure 9, one observes that a mass ratio of 10 leads to a minimal duration equal to 53.83 years whereas a mass ratio equal to 4 results in 55.90 years. Hence an increase of 150 % in the mass of the deceleration system, produces only a 3.7 % increase in the performance of the system.

The state vectors of the Sun and the planets are obtained from the DE405 planetary ephemeris (Standish 1998). The initial conditions of the comet nucleus are chosen at the time of the c/a, as retrieved from the Horizons JPL system (Giorgini et al. 1996), and are then integrated backward in time to the epoch when the comet was at10 AU, i.e., the heliocentric distance that we assume as the beginning of the activity of the comet. The maximum heliocentric distance of 10 AU is chosen based on pre-discovery images of the active comet at approximately 8 AU, and considering that the region of the sky where the comet was between 8 and 10 AU was not covered by surveys (T. Spahr, MPC, priv. comm.). The comet nucleus is considered massless, and grains are assigned a radius and density in order to compute the effects of radiation pressure, and are integrated individually. As a trade-off between simulation performance and accuracy, gravitational interactions are computed only with the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars, and limit the nominal accuracy of the numerical integrator. This causes a significant speed-up of simulations compared to including all planets, and causes a difference in c/a distance of dust grains of the order of a few hundred kilometers. This is relatively small compared to the few thousand kilometers uncertainty on the comet c/a distance, especially considering the statistical nature of this study. Dust grains are ejected isotropically from the nucleus, at a velocity that is determined using an empirical scaling law, based on the results in Whipple (1951). This choice is due to the difficulty of developing a detailed self-consistent physical model of grain ejection driven by hyper-volatiles at large heliocentric distances and then water within approximately 3 AU from the Sun, as such a model would require some mechanisms for the depletion of hyper-volatiles at shorter heliocentric distance, or would otherwise produce unrealistically large ejection velocities.

The figure provides the fluence values for all ejected grains at the given v ref value. However, as we have discussed above, HST observations indicate lower velocities at which no grains intercept Mars. The way to interpret these plots is then to assume that while the v ref parameter from HST indicates the velocity of the bulk of the grains, it is possible that the velocity distribution of grains contains an high-velocity tail, so that only afew-percent of the grains will have these higher velocities. Processes responsible for this could be the presence of jets, or the shape of the nucleus causing non-uniformities in the gas flow and in the acceleration of grains from the surface. In view of this interpretation, the fluence values in Figure 4 should be decreased by several orders of magnitude as we move to higher values of v ref , to reflect the smaller and smaller fraction of grains which could be in the high-velocity tail. As a result, the fluence decreases by approximately two orders of magnitude at v ref \u2243 1.5 m/s and by several orders of magnitude at higher v ref values, to obtain a maximum fluence of the order of 10 \u22127 grains/m 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

The model uses very high ejection velocities, assumes that water-driven production will be principally responsible for grains delivery to Mars, and uses very large volumes to compute the fluence, averaging low flux region and high density regions near the comet nucleus, strongly biasing the results towards high fluence values. In Ye & Hui (2014) a dynamical model very similar to ours is employed, including a similar velocity scaling and similar constraints from observations, and an orbit solution just a few weeks older than ours. They obtain no collisions with Mars at the nominal grain velocities, and fluence similar to ours if the grain velocity is increased, after accounting for different parameters (density and SFD index). Although the peak timing tends to shorter delays after c/a at high v ref values (see Figure 3), the strong attenuation from the velocity distribution causes the v ref \u2243 1.5 m/s timing to dominate, with a peak between 90 and 100 minutes after c/a. The timings provided in this paper refer to the current estimate of the c/a time as indicated in the Introduction, and will not change even if the nucleus c/a will change due to possible strong non-gravitational forces which may become important in the last few months before c/a (Farnocchia et al. 2014).

It exerts its action on cells by creating irreversible oxaliplatin-DNA adducts that subsequently yield doublestranded breaks in the DNA. Although it has been shown to induce apoptosis  in a manner that does not show major dependency on cell cycle phases (with the restriction that of course the DNA is always more exposed, and thus more sensitive to oxaliplatin insults, in S-phase), other studies have shown that its main effect on cancer cells was likely to be mostly active by arresting the cell division cycle at the G 2 /M, and to a lesser extent, at the G 1 /S transitions , effects on apoptosis occurring only after a prolonged exposure time. In the sequel, we shall assess these two main actions, both induced by DNA damage. The effect on death rates will be assumed to be directly proportional to the damage induced to the DNA, whereas the effect on phase transitions, physiologically due mainly to p53 (not represented as such in this study), will be represented by a variable delay due to cells under repair, that will be represented by a specific subpopulation appended to each one of the main phases G 1 and S \u2212 G 2 ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Ten objects are studied in five frequency bands (23-94GHz): the outer planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) and five fixed celestial sources (Cas A, Tau A, Cyg A, 3C274 and 3C58). The seven-year analysis of Jupiter provides temperatures which are within 1\u03c3 of the previously published WMAP five-year values, with slightly tighter constraints on variability with orbital phase (0.2% \u00b1 0.4%), and limits (but no detections) on linear polarization. Observed temperatures for both Mars and Saturn vary significantly with viewing geometry. Scaling factors are provided which, when multiplied by the Wright Mars thermal model predictions at 350\u00b5m, reproduce WMAP seasonally averaged observations of Mars within \u223c 2%. An empirical model is described which fits brightness variations of Saturn due to geometrical effects and can be used to predict the WMAP observations to within 3%. Seven-year mean temperatures for Uranus and Neptune are also tabulated. Uncertainties in Uranus temperatures are 3%-4% in the 41, 61 and 94 GHz bands; the smallest uncertainty for Neptune is 8% for the 94 GHz band. Intriguingly, the spectrum of Uranus appears to show a dip at \u223c 30 GHz of unidentified origin, although the feature is not of high statistical significance. Flux densities for the five selected fixed celestial sources are derived from the seven-year WMAP sky maps, and are tabulated for Stokes I, Q and U, along with polarization fraction and position angle. Fractional uncertainties for the Stokes I fluxes are typically 1 % to 3%. Source variability over the seven-year baseline is also estimated. Significant secular decrease is seen for Cas A and Tau A: our results are consistent with a frequency independent decrease of about 0.53% per year for Cas A and 0.22% per year for Tau A.

These attributes make WMAP data of natural interest for ancillary studies of sky-based calibration objects. This paper focuses on WMAP observations of selected planets and fixed celestial objects which have been commonly used as calibrators in the microwave, either by ground-or space-based instruments. We provide fundamental measurements for these objects which will be of use not only for calibration purposes, but also other studies, such as planetary radiative transfer. A brief discussion of WMAP planetary radiometric data was made by Hill et al. (2009), with an earlier discussion of Jupiter temperatures by Page et al. (2003b). We extend these presentations to include WMAP observations of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune over aseven-year interval (2001 - 2008), in five microwave passbands ranging from \u223c23 to 94 GHz. We also select five bright celestial sources for more detailed study: Cas A, Cyg A, Tau A, 3C58 and 3C274. The WMAP project routinely compiles and distributes a point source catalog, which tabulates mean flux values in those same five passbands for bright sources off the Galactic plane (Wright et al. 2009; Hinshaw et al. 2007; Bennett et al. 2003a). However, four of the five objects discussed here (Cas A, Tau A, Cyg A, 3C 58) have low Galactic latitudes and are not included in the catalog.

Detailed descriptions of the mission profile and hardware can be found in Bennett et al. (2003b), Jarosik et al. (2003a) and Page et al. (2003b . To assist with clarifying the terminology and analysis methods presented in this paper, we describe the key features of the mission. WMAP observes the sky differentially: signal from the sky is simultaneously sampled in two different directions \u223c 140 \u00b0 apart and guided by 10 feed horn pairs into 10 receivers, referred to as differencing assemblies (DAs). The receivers cover five frequency bands (K, Ka, Q, V and W) with approximate center frequencies of \u223c23, 33, 41, 61 and 94 GHz, respectively. There is  one DA each for K and Ka bands (K1, Ka1),  two DAs each for Q and V bands (Q1, Q2, V1, V2) and  four DAs (W1, W2, W3, W4) for W band. The frequency passbands are broad (\u223c 20% fractional bandwidth), so that the exact frequency associated with an observation depends on the source spectrum. An orthomode transducer at the throat of each feed separates the sky signal into  two orthogonal polarizations, allowing for reconstruction of both intensity and linear polarization signals. Angular resolution is moderate, ranging from roughly 0.2 \u00b0 FWHM in W band to \u223c 0.9 \u00b0 FWHM in K band."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

To facilitate high redundancy in sky coverage, the spacecraft rotates about a spin axis, which also precesses. These combined motions produce a \u223c 45 \u00b0 wide scan swath which looks like a \" belt \" projected onto the sky, passing through the ecliptic poles. The scan swath returns to its original starting position on the ecliptic every year, after completing a full-sky survey with multiple observations per sky pixel. A primary strength of WMAP data is the calibration accuracy, with an absolute calibration error of 0.2% (Jarosik et al. 2010). The absolute calibration is tied to knowledge of the CMB monopole and the spacecraft orbital velocity, and thus is independent of any reliance on previously established measurements of the sources under study.

Observations of the planets must be extracted from the calibrated time-ordered data (TOD), and then undergo quality assessment and background removal before they can be analyzed. The extraction process gathers all observations from the TOD taken withinseveral degrees of each planet and associates ancillary information such as position in the focal plane, attitude, planet viewing aspect and data quality flags with each observation. Observations whose sky positions lie within a 7 \u00b0 radius of other planets or which are of suspect quality are immediately rejected. In addition, observations are excluded from use if either beam of a DA feed-horn pair samples sky coordinates that fall within the boundaries of a spatial processing mask (Jarosik et al. 2007). The purpose of this \" Galactic masking \" is to mitigate background removal error by excluding observations located near strong-signal, high-gradient regions of the Galaxy. For those observations which survive these quality control steps, Galactic and CMB background signals are subtracted. The background signal subtracted from each observation is computed from the DA-appropriate seven-year mean map (from which planetary data were excluded), using the value from the \u223c 6 \u2032 wide pixel which is closest in spatial coordinates to those of the time-ordered observation.Table 1 lists the beginning and ending dates of the observing seasons for the five planets, i.e., when they are directly in the WMAP viewing swath.

The fiducial disk area A ref is simply A proj disk evaluated at D W of0 \u00b0 . Planetary radii and north pole directions used to compute D W are adopted from Seidelmann et al. (2007); the polar and equatorial radii are listed inTable 2. Because WMAP is at L2, D W is not very dissimilar to that of the sub-Earth latitude, D e . As the brightest \" point source \" visible to WMAP, Jupiter is used to characterize the main beam response of the instrument. This process and analysis are described in detail in Hill et al. (2009), Jarosik et al. (2010), and Page et al. (2003b. The end result is a set of seven-year, azimuthally-symmetrized, one-dimensional radial beam profiles per DA. These radial beam profiles are then used to derive window functions used for CMB power spectrum deconvolution. Unlike the rest of the planetary temperatures in this section, the seven-year mean Jupiter temperatures are derived from the l = 0 value of the unnormalized window functions (which measures T m \u2126 B ), coupled with the fiducial solid angle for Jupiter (Hill et al. 2009). For all other planetary analysis, brightness temperatures are derived using a template-fitting technique, which takes advantage of the high-quality beam information obtained from sevenyears of Jupiter observations. After the processing steps described above, radial response profiles are produced for each planet, per DA, per season, by assigning observations to 0.25 arcmin bins increasing in angular distance from the planet's center. Each bin is assigned a mean value and an error based on instrument noise appropriate to the number of observations within the bin. The known radial beam response, based on seven-year Jupiter data, is used as a fitting template to the seasonal radial profile for each DA. The fit returns T m for the planet. The brightness temperature is then derived from T m , the main-beam solid angle (Jarosik et al. 2010) and the reference solid angle for the planet as per the above equations. Errors include the formal error in the template coefficient and the propagated error in the beam solid angle.Figure 1 illustrates sample W1 radial profiles for a single observing season for each of the planets. The beam template is overplotted in red. As well as illustrating the technique, the figure is also a useful comparator of signal quality for each planet at W-band. Beam dilution increases with decreasing WMAP frequency: \u2126 B is roughly 24.6, 14.4, 8.98, 4.20 and 2.10\u00d710 \u22125 sr for the K -W bands respectively (Jarosik et al. 2010). Tabulated brightness temperatures are appropriate for the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) approximation . Brightness temperatures provided in the Tables do not include the CMB contribution blocked by the planet but included in the background. As noted in the Tables, absolute brightness temperature is obtained by adding 2.2, 2.0, 1.9, 1.5 and 1.1 K in bands K, Ka, Q, V and W respectively (Page et al. 2003a ), since in the RJ approximation the CMB temperatures are frequency dependent.

As such, the observations are helpful for providing constraints on atmospheric models for Jupiter, which in turn could be used for calibration purposes. However, as noted by e.g., Gibson et al. (2005) , there is a fine point to consider: small contributions to the total observed intensity from a synchrotron component up to about40 GHz are expected. This non-thermal \" decimetric emission \" arises from charged particles trapped close to Jupiter by its strong magnetic field, and dominates the spectrum at frequencies less than about 3 GHz. Estimates in the literature place the synchrotron contribution at 23 GHz near 1% of the total intensity (de Pater & Dunn 2003; Gibson et al. 2005), with a roughly T \u223c \u03bd \u22122.4 frequency dependence (). However, the synchrotron emission is known to be variable on a wide range of time scales (Santos-Costa et al. 2009; de Pater & Dunn 2003; de Pater et al. 2003; Miyoshi et al. 2000), and accurate removal is difficult. The WMAP seven-year mean Jupiter brightness temperatures are graphically compared against those in the literature in Figure 2. Ground-based observational values are taken from compilations of Joiner & Steffes (1991) and , along with individual observations from de Pater et al. (1982 Pater et al. ( , 2001), Greve et al. (1994) and Goldin et al. (1997). Estimates of the synchrotron emission have been removed from the observations in the figure by many, but not all, of the authors, and not necessarily to the same level. The WMAP observations are plotted \" as observed \" . As an estimate of the stability of Jupiter's emission with orbital phase over the seven year interval, we extend the five-year analysis of Hill et al. (2009), in which temperatures for individual Jupiter observing seasons are computed and compared to the multi-year mean values. Individual seasonal temperatures are derived using the same beam-profile fitting technique which is used for the other planets (Section 3.1). We compute \u2206T /T as the mean deviation of all DAs from their seven-year mean values, and include a 1\u03c3 standard deviation as a measure of coherency. These results are listed inTable 4. Using the WMAP five-year data, Hill et al. (2009) quote an upper limit of 0.3% \u00b1 0.5% based on the largest deviation and scatter seen in the first 10 observing seasons, which occurred in season four. A careful examination of the entries in Table 4 with the largest deviations and/or scatter (observing seasons 4, 11, 12) shows that these particular instances have more to do with template fitting and background subtraction quality than with intrinsic source variability. The two seasons with high scatter (4, 12) are those in which the number of available observations for fitting has been significantly reduced because of foreground masking ( \" % masked \" in theTable), which increases the statistical error in the temperature determination. Season 11, with the highest \u2206T /T , is one in which Jupiter is nearly aligned with the Galactic center, but outside the processing mask. This is a region in which background subtraction is subject to greater error because of higher temperature gradients across the pixels in the map used for background removal. If one ignores these three entries, then an upper limit of 0.2% \u00b1 0.4% is more appropriate. We also searched for indications that K band might be more intrinsically variable than W band, because of the small synchrotron contribution. There is no indication of such a frequency dependence in the data, but the upper envelope here is about 0.5%. The WMAP Jupiter observations were analyzed to determine if any linear polarization signal could be detected. A special version of the beam mapping software was run for Jupiter, in which the angle between the polarization axis of each radiometer and the planet's magnetic dipole was computed for each observation. For each differencing assembly, all observations within a tight radius of beam center were accumulated, corrected to peak beam response, background subtracted, loss imbalance corrected, separated by radiometer, and then used to solve for Stokes parameters I, Q, U and their errors. For a more complete description of the relevant equations, see Hinshaw et al. (2003) and Jarosik et al. (2007). Normalized Stokes parameters Q/I and U/I are reported inTable 5, along with their propagated errors and estimated linear polarization fraction, p lin = (Q/I) 2 + (U/I) 2 . No attempt has been made to correct for noise bias in either p lin or its reported error, which is simply the propagated error. The estimated signal-to-noise is low, with no significant detections in any differencing assembly. Linear polarization of the synchrotron emission at 15 and 22 GHz has been detected by de Pater & Dunn (2003) using the Very Large Array (VLA). They were unable to obtain a synchrotron polarization fraction at 22 GHz, but estimated 20% polarization based on the 15 GHz observations, which implies roughly a 0.2% polarization fraction at K band using a combined thermal and non-thermal intensity. The WMAP results are consistent with this estimate, but do not provide any further constraint."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Much of the perceived variability from earth-orbit is attributable to geometrical factors: the apparent phase as seen by the observer and changes in solar irradiance as Mars' distance from the Sun varies in its elliptical orbit (Wright 1976). There are a number of additional complexities, however. The day/night cycle imparts a significant rotational modulation to the observed temperature as the surface heats and cools. In the infrared, variable atmospheric effects including molecular line absorption and dust storms can be of importance. Additionally, the Martian surface is itself far from homogenous, with polar ice-caps of changing extent and variations in albedo and thermal inertia on relatively small scales (Putzig & Mellon 2007; Christensen et al. 2001). Planetary science studies notwithstanding, the astronomical community has most consistently referencedtwo basic models when calibrating to Mars: the \" Wright model \" (Wright 1976, Wright & Odenwald 1980, Wright 2007) and the \" Rudy model \" (Rudy et al. 1987, Muhleman & Berge 1991), both developed before the current level of detail available from orbiters such as Mars Global Surveyor (MGS). In the thermal emission regime (\u03bb 10\u00b5m), the planet's brightness temperature can be computed to first order as re-emission of absorbed solar energy by a surface layer with a characteristic albedo, emissivity and thermal inertia (de Pater 1990). The Wright model uses this approach to predict thermal emission in the 10-350 \u00b5m range, with no positional variations of parameters such as albedo and thermal inertia. The Rudy model originates from VLA observations at 2 and 6cm, which sample further into the Martian subsurface. Concurrent measurements of the polarized flux are used to estimate radio reflectivities and absorption lengths as a function of planetary latitude , and brightness temperatures calculated via radiative transfer as a function of position on a longitude/latitude grid. Typical errors on T b quoted for the Wright model are \u00b15%, or about \u00b110K, and those for the Rudy model at 5%-10%. We have chosen in this paper to compare the WMAP observations against predictions from the Wright model, primarily because of its long history of use and readily available model code (Wright 2007), but also because the seasonal brightness temperatures quoted for WMAP are the resultant average over several weeks of data, which means we are only sampling mean properties at best. We have modified the 2007 Wright model code in three ways: (1) JPL ephemeris positions are substituted for the lower precision formulae originally used; (2) an option is added to use WMAP spacecraft positions rather than those of the Earth; and (3) computations are extended out to WMAP frequencies. The first two changes are not critical to the analysis, as the combined modifications introduce at most at 0.6 K difference from the original results. Typically the model predicts brightness temperatures at 3mm which are a few Kelvins lower than those at 350\u00b5m, and the temperature spread between the extrema of the 5 WMAP frequencies is quite low, of order 0.5 K. Hill et al. (2009) presented the first five years of WMAP Mars observations at 94 GHz. Here we extend the W-band observations to seven years, and include the observations at the other four WMAP frequencies. Mean brightness temperatures for Mars at five frequencies and seven WMAP observing seasons derived from the seven-year data are presented inTable 6 . After correcting to absolute brightness temperature and converting from Rayleigh- Jeans to Planck brightness temperature 1 , the seven seasonal W-band averages are shown in comparison to the Wright model predictions at 3.2mm inFigure 3. This plot is similar toFigure 15 of Hill et al. (2009), whose preliminary analysis found that the Wright model was a good predictor of the mean temporal variation, but the model T b seemed high by roughly 10%. Our results generally agree, but we find that multiplying the Wright model by a factor of 0.953 fits the seven-year data best. If one uses the Wright model tabulated at 350\u00b5m, the plot looks nearly identical, but the scaling factor is 0.941, or about a 6% reduction. A previous comparison by Griffin et al. (1986) indicated that the 3mm wholedisk observations of Ulich (1981) were within 7.5% of Wright model predictions at 350 \u00b5m. The first WMAP Mars observing season occurred during the time of the 2001 July-October massive global dust storm which elevated atmospheric temperatures in the mid-IR by nearly 40 K (Smith et al. 2002). The effect of dust storms on microwave data is expected to be less of a concern, but we did fit for the model scaling factor both with and without inclusion of the first observing season, with no significantly different results."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

A search was made for a dataset that would provide absolutely calibrated, whole-disk observations of Mars which spanned both sides of the thermal energy distribution peak and were taken over a reasonably contiguous interval of time. Mars data taken by the COBE/DIRBE instrument (Boggess et al. 1992; Hauser et al. 1998) for a146day interval (1990 April 28 -September 20) most closely matched these requirements, although no analysis of the publicly available data appears to have been previously published. There are six DIRBE wavebands which sample the thermal emission portion of the Mars spectrum, with effective wavelengths of 12, 25, , 60100, 140 and 240 \u00b5m. Of these, the 25 \u00b5m observations cannot be used as an independent check of the Wright model, since the model itself was the ultimate source of the DIRBE absolute calibration in this band (S. Moseley & W. Glaccum 2009, private commu- nication, Hauser et al. 1998). In addition, while the 12, 25, 140 and 240\u00b5m detectors are well-behaved linear devices, the 60 and 100\u00b5m detectors are known to suffer non-linear response , and Mars is on the bright end of that response. DIRBE is a broad-band photometer, and reports monochromatic flux values at the effective wavelength of each band assuming a constant source spectrum in \u03bdI \u03bd across the band. One must apply a \" color correction factor \" to the reported fluxes if the source spectrum is different from that assumed. The DIRBE Explanatory Supplement provides such factors for gray-body and power-law spectra. However , in the case of Mars, some of the DIRBE bands intercept known atmospheric absorption lines. A significant CO 2 absorption centered at 15\u00b5m lies well within the 12\u00b5m passband, and grazes the blue edge of the 25\u00b5m band. Numerous minor water vapor absorptions are known to occur at wavelengths sampled by the 60 and 100\u00b5m bands (Sidher et al. 2000). We have used spectral data available from the MGS Thermal Emission Spectrograph (TES) public archives and the ISO spectrum published by Sidher et al. (2000) to form approximate correction factors for the DIRBE data at these bands: only the 12\u00b5m band required significant correction. For the 140 and 240 \u00b5m bands, color corrections were calculated using the spectrum predicted by the Wright model."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

The Wright model was designed to predict infrared emission arising from the top layer of the Martian surface, whereas the microwave signal originates from subsurface layers of orderseveral centimeters deep (de Pater 1990; Orton & Burgdorf 2003 ), with potentially different composition and compaction. This was recognized by Griffin et al. (1986 slightly revised version of the model maintained at NRAO 4 . In general, Rudy model predictions using the \" standard dielectric constant \" were slightly high compared to the WMAP observations, by \u223c 1% at 3.2 and 4.9mm and roughly 3% at 7.3, 9.1 and 13.1mm. It should be noted that the WMAP observations provide model constraints only in the disk-averaged sense. The post-processing scaling of the Wright model suggested here simulates a frequency-dependent emissivity, which implies slow changes in mean subsurface properties with depth. In the Rudy model, which already incorporates subsurface sampling, use of model parameters derived from the radio data produces agreement with WMAP within a few percent. It is possible that this agreement could be improved either through the use of a revised dielectric function or updated thermal inertia and albedo maps. The thermophysical parameters used by the Rudy model are based on \u223c20 year old maps of thermal inertia and albedo from the Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) aboard Viking (Muhleman & Berge 1991). More recent MGS maps of these quantities obtained using the TES instrument are available with roughly 10 to 40 times better spatial resolution, full planet coverage and approximately twice the signal-to-noise (Christensen 1998; Christensen et al. 2001). The surface albedo has been observed to have some time dependence: a visual comparison between the Viking IRTM and TES albedo maps shows alterations in the spatial pattern have occurred since the Viking mapping (Christensen et al. 2001)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

The crossover point between thetwo emission mechanisms occurs near 1cm (Dunn et al. 2002; Schloerb et al. 1980; Epstein et al. 1980), with thermal emission dominating shortwards and scattering longwards. Optical depths have been measured at a variety of wavelengths: Dowling et al. (1987) found that the optical depth of the combined ABC rings is roughly gray over a wide frequency range. Voyager I radio occultation observations (Tyler et al. 1983) at 3.6 and 13cm produced radial profiles of optical depth for the A and C rings and Cassini division, but only approximate results for portions of the B ring with \u03c4 > 1. The most complex and recent modeling of microwave data is that of Dunn et al. (2002 Dunn et al. ( , 2005 Dunn et al. ( , 2007) who use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to simulate the scattered and thermal emission of the rings based on VLA and other high-resolution observations. WMAP does not spatially resolve the individual components of the Saturn system, nor is the spectral coverage sufficient to definitively isolate ring scattering and thermal spectral regimes. However, the changes in viewing geometry with orbital phase can be used to break degeneracy between ring and disk components, especially as the viewing aspect of the rings becomes more \" edge-on \" . Over the currently available seven-year observing baseline, Saturn's rings are seen at inclinations between  \u221228\u00b0 and  \u22126 \u00b0 : the sign convention indicates that the planet's south pole is tilting slowly away from the observer as the 0 \u00b0 edge-on equatorial configuration is approached.Figure 6 illustrates the  two extrema andTable 9 lists mean times and ring opening angles for each observing season. Hill et al. (2009) briefly discussed WMAP five-year W-band observations of Saturn, which sampled ring opening angles B \u2264 \u221217 \u00b0 . They found that the brightness temperature could be fit remarkably well with a simple sin B dependence. This convenient relationship does not effectively characterize the behavior at lower inclinations, however, and so a more complex formulation is needed for the seven-year data. We adopt a simple empirical model of Saturn's microwave emission, variants of which have appeared in the literature for over 30years (e.g., Epstein et al. 1980). The goal is to provide a predictive formula for the unresolved observed brightness of Saturn with as low an error as possible: however, given the WMAP data constraints, such a model will lack physical detail. At a given frequency \u03bd, we assume a single temperature for the planetary disk, T disk (\u03bd), and that all rings are characterized by the same temperature T ring (\u03bd). The model variant we adopt allows for seven radially concentric ring divisions as defined by Dunn et al. (2002), which are based on optical depth variations observed by Voyager (Tyler et al. 1983). Each of the seven ring sectors has its own ring-normal optical depth \u03c4 0,i , with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 7, but each \u03c4 0,i is assumed to be both constant within its ring and frequency independent."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Formal errors for the ring and disk temperatures at lower frequencies are higher because the ring contribution is smaller and there is a larger covariance between thetwo components. The model fit and residuals are shown inFigure 7. The model reproduces the observations to within \u223c 3%, but observations closer to B = 0 \u00b0 would better constrain the disk temperatures and so reduce the covariance between the disk and rings. The parameterization chosen for the ring optical depths, together with the incomplete sampling of the ring system orientation, allows for alternate models which would fit the data equally well but return somewhat different mean disk and ring temperatures. This systematic is not reflected in the formal fitting errors inTable 11. In order to assess the magnitude of this error, we explored a small number of model variants. The model which fit the data equally well but returned temperatures with the largest differences compared toTable 11 consisted of a combined ABC ring represented by a single \u03c4 0 , which was a free parameter in the fit. Disk temperatures derived for this model were \u223c 2.5K higher, and ring temperatures \u223c 1  K  lower.

The presence of band-like structures (which can persist foryears) and latitudinal brightness gradients at the \u223c 5% level have been noted by several observers at wavelengths of 2cm and longward (Grossman et al. 1989; de Pater & Dickel 1991; van der Tak et al. 1999 ). There is less discussion in the literature of disk temperature structure and/or variability at the frequencies observed by WMAP: there have been no reports of bands or localized structures, but some indication of north/south latitudinal brightness differences. Within the seven-year epoch under consideration, Dunn et al. (2005) observed a latitudinal disk brightness gradient at 3mm, such that the north pole was brighter than the south by \u223c 5%. They interpreted differences between their 1.3mm and 3mm data, taken roughly 4months apart, as possible evidence for atmospheric changes on week to month timescales. In order to estimate potential model bias caused by the assumption of a uniform disk temperature, Saturn seasonal brightness temperatures were simulated using geometrical models similar to those described in this section, with the addition of a disk latitudinal gradient as described by Dunn et al. (2005) . If one makes the assumption that such a temperature gradient is persistent over seven years and exists at all WMAP frequencies, then such structure would produce a temperature behavior with inclination which is asymmetric about B = 0 \u00b0 . This is because the rings would obscure hotter regions in the northern portion of the disk but colder regions in the south, producing a maximum deviation from symmetry of \u223c 1% at the largest ring opening angles. Since the WMAP seven-year observations sample slightly less than half of the full B range, this asymmetry would not be evident, and a model fit which assumes a constant disk temperature would use the ring model component to compensate for the disk temperature gradient. For a simulated dataset matching the WMAP seven-year observing seasons, the model fit returns a mean ring temperature biased by less than 1 K, with an unbiased recovery of the mean whole-disk temperature. This estimate is of uncertain quality, however, because it is based on a snapshot of Saturn at  one wavelength and a narrow time window. For this reason, the adopted errors inTable 11  An extended, low optical depth dust ring associated with Saturn's moon Phoebe was recently discovered using Spitzer imaging at 24 and 70\u00b5m (Verbiscer et al. 2009). With a quoted radial extent between at least 128 and 207 Saturn radii, or roughly 1 \u00b0 in apparent diameter, it would be possible for WMAP to resolve the Phoebe ring, with W band as the best chance for doing so. However, no signal from the ring was detected by WMAP. Properties of the grains are not well specified, but naive estimates assuming typical dust emission and optical depth frequency dependencies would predict temperatures at 94 GHz of less than 1 \u00b5K, well below achievable noise levels of about 300 \u00b5K (1\u03c3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Spectral coverage in the microwave is somewhat undersampled, however, leaving room for interpretation in atmospheric modeling efforts . The microwave spectra of Uranus and Neptune lack the broad NH 3 absorption centered near24 GHz which is characteristic of Jupiter and Saturn. At millimeter wavelengths, collision-induced absorption by H 2 is considered the dominant continuum opacity source. CO rotational absorptions have been observed for Neptune in the sub-millimeter (Marten et al. 2005 ). At centimeter wavelengths, ammonia (which is depleted relative to solar nitrogen levels ) and hydrogen sulfide are the main opacity contributors (Deboer & Steffes 1996; Spilker 1995;). Of special note is Uranus' unique 98 \u00b0 obliquity, which allows for a slowly changing pole-to-pole panorama of the planet as it moves in its 84year orbit, and may also play a role in determining atmospheric conditions. For selected frequencies, observational databases spanning decades have permitted characterization of the variability of these two planets. Uranus in particular has exhibited long-term whole-disk temperature changes since 1966 which correlate with the viewing aspect of the south pole. After accounting for geometrical solid angle changes, Kramer et al. (2008) reported a gradual temperature drop of order 10% over 20years (1985-2005) at 90 GHz. This is interpreted as a true integrated-disk temperature change, as the 1985 face-on contribution from the bright south pole progressively morphs into a 2007 view dominated by colder equatorial regions. Similar findings, with similar phasing albeit different amplitudes, have been reported in the radio (Klein & Hofstadter 2006) and visible (Hammel & Lockwood 2007). There is weaker evidence that some portion of variability in the light curves is attributable to changes deep in the atmosphere (Klein & Hofstadter 2006); Hofstadter & Butler (2003) used VLA 2 and 6cm \" snapshots \" of the disk over several  years to argue for opacity changes in zonal bands. Neptune's microwave variability is less well documented, although there is ample evidence for variability in the visible and near- IR, as summarized by Hammel & Lockwood (2007). Kramer et al. (2008 find the 90 GHz integrated disk temperature to be constant to within \u223c 8% over 20years. Peak WMAP antenna temperatures for these distant \" ice giants \" range from roughly 1 mK at W band to \u223c0.2mK at K band. The signal-to-noise for individual observations of these objects is low (\u223c0.3 at W band, \u223c0.14 at K band), resulting in large statistical errors in single-season disk temperature determinations. Tables 12 and 13 present the single-season brightness temperatures computed for Uranus and Neptune. Brightness temperatures are listed per frequency rather than per DA as a means of boosting signal-to-noise for those frequencies with multiple DAs. Temperatures for Uranus observing seasons four and five exhibit somewhat larger error bars than other seasons. For these two seasons, there was a reduction in the number of observations available for analysis because data quality checks excluded observations in close proximity to Mars sky coordinates. Sub-WMAP latitudes for Uranus range between \u221230 \u00b0 and 4 \u00b0 over our seven-year baseline . Linear correlations of T b against both sub-WMAP latitude and time produced no statistically significant trend other than a flat line. This is not surprising given that the tightest seasonal temperature errors are of order 10%, which encompasses the entire twentyyear range of variation seen in the 90 GHz light curves of Kramer et al. (2008). We performed similar correlations for Neptune, with again the same null variability result. Note, however, that the sub-WMAP latitude for this planet is relatively unchanged over the epochs of observation . With no discernable variability over the observing baseline, we computed seven-year means of the disk brightness for each planet; these are listed as the last line in Tables 12 and 13 . These seven-year means in turn may be compared to observations in the literature and placed in context with the microwave spectra in general.  only returned those few acquired in the late 1960s, listed inTable 1 of Gulkis et al. (1978). For a variety of reasons, more recent observations would be preferable, but the older epoch does have the advantage of sharing a similar viewing geometry to that of the WMAP data. These older observations are plotted in gray in the Figure, and agree well with the WMAP measurements, but also do not define a \" dip \" at high statistical significance. Although suggestive of an interesting atmospheric opacity constraint for future study, the possibility of such a feature has gone unremarked in the literature."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

For each frequency band, the azimuthally symmetrized beam profile (see Section 3.1) is convolved with a sky map pixel to produce a map-based beam template. The sum of the pixel-convolved beam template plus a sloping planar base level is fit to the Stokes I, Q, and U sky map data at each source position, using pixels within 3.5 times the beam width \u03c3 (1.5 times the FWHM) in each band. The peak source temperature from each fit is converted from thermodynamic temperature to Rayleigh-Jeans brightness temperature and then translated to a source flux density using a conversion factor \u0393 that is a weak function of the source spectral index (Jarosik et al. 2010). For point sources, this method of flux measurement is more accurate than the aperture photometry method as used for example by Page et al. (2003b) for Tau A. The WMAP beam profiles have extended wings (Hill et al. 2009), so an aperture radius 3 times the beam FWHM should be used and the results are more susceptible to error due to background confusion. The uncertainty in flux density is calculated as the quadrature sum of (1) map measurement uncertainty, (2) the uncertainty in \u0393 (0.5% to 0.7% depending on the band), and (3) the 0.2% absolute calibration uncertainty. For Stokes I, map measurement uncertainty is estimated from the rms fit residual in the fit region. The Stokes I residuals generally appear to be dominated by beam asymmetry effects, but also include background confusion and noise. (The source profiles in the maps are asymmetric due to asymmetry in the instantaneous beam profiles and the nonuniform distribution of scan angles over a year for sources away from the ecliptic poles.) For Stokes Q and U, map measurement uncertainty is calculated either from the 1\u03c3 source peak uncertainty and base level uncertainty from the beam fitting or as the Q or U flux times the fractional map measurement uncertainty for I, whichever is largest. The latter method is the estimated uncertainty in Q or U due to beam asymmetry effects, assuming the fractional uncertainty is the same in Q or U as it is in I. The flux determination was tested on simulated sky maps containing a population of point  sources with no other signals and no noise, generated using WMAP beam window functions as described in Wright et al. (2009). Recovered flux densities were accurate to about 0.1% or better, except in W band where the recovered fluxes tended to be larger than the input fluxes by up to 1%. This is allowed for by including an additional 1% uncertainty term in the quadrature sum for W band. Fractional year-to-year variability for the selected sources has been obtained using sky maps for individual years 1-7. To remove confusion noise from the CMB and Galactic foregrounds, we subtract the seven-year average map from each individual year map for each band. A pixel-convolved beam plus flat base level is fit to each difference map at each source position, giving a flux difference \u2206F i for the ith year for each source in each band. Uncertainty in \u2206F i is calculated from the quadrature sum of the source peak uncertainty and the base level uncertainty. The flux difference is divided by the mean flux from the seven-year map to get the fractional flux variation \u2206F i /F . For K, Ka, and Q bands, there is a small ( 0.2%) but significant year-to-year variation in the WMAP calibration, which we have measured by correlating each yearly map against the seven-year map (seeFigure 1 of Jarosik et al. 2010). The measured fractional flux variations in K-Q bands are corrected for these calibration variations c i using (\u2206F i /F ) corrected = (\u2206F i /F ) measured + (1 \u2212 c i )."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Fractional uncertainties for the Stokes I fluxes are typically 1 to 3%. For some of the sources, the maximum source extent given inTable 14 is not entirely negligible relative to the WMAP beam width in V or W band (FWHM 19.6 \u2032 in V, FWHM 12.2 \u2032 in W, Hinshaw et al. 2009). We have estimated the possible error due to source extent for Tau A. The 1.4GHz map of the Tau A region from the NVSS survey (beam size 45 \u2032\u2032 FWHM, Condon et al. 1998) was smoothed with the symmetrized WMAP V or W-band beam and converted to a resolution 9 (Nside = 512) HEALPix map. The flux determined by our method was found to underestimate the true flux by 1.5% in V band and 3.7% in W band. Spatial variations of the spectral index over Tau A are very small (Morsi & Reich 1987; Bietenholz et al. 1997; Green et al. 2004) so the source extent at W band is probably similar to that at 1.4 GHz. Our V and W-band fluxes for Cas A and 3C58 may also be underestimated by similar amounts. To allow for this, the uncertainty values listed for these  three sources inTable 15 nificant secular decrease is seen for Cas A and Tau A. The results are consistent with a frequency independent decrease of about 0.53% per year for Cas A and 0.22% per year for Tau A. Our results for Cas A fall between the \u223c 0.6% per year decrease found by O'Sullivan & Green (1999) Significant yearly flux variation is not seen for Cyg A and 3C58; the rms year-to-year variation is consistent with the uncertainties in each band. The lowest rms variation is in K band, and is 0.27% for Cyg A and 0.33% for 3C58. Carilli & Barthel (1996) give an upper limit of 10% on Cyg A core variability from observations at 5, 15, and 90 GHz over timescales from 10months to 15years. The core contributes \u2264 10% of the total flux at WMAP frequencies (e.g., Robson et al. 1998). For 3C274 there is evidence for year-to-year variability of about 2% in K, Ka, and Q bands. The rms variation is 1.8 to 2.6 times the mean uncertainty in these bands, and the variations are correlated from band to band. Previous observations of 3C274 have shown greater variability. At 90 GHz, Steppe et al. (1988)Wagner et al. 2009), which corresponds to 4% of the total flux. Smaller core flux variations, less than 1% of the total flux, have been observed at lower frequencies (Morabito et al. 1988; Junor & Biretta 1995; Harris et al. 2009). Spectra of the seven-year WMAP fluxes together with previous measurements from the literature are shown in Figures 14 -18. For Cas A, we have scaled the WMAP fluxes, the Archeops fluxes of Desert et al. (2008), the SCUBA fluxes of Dunne et al. (2003), and the BLAST fluxes of Sibthorpe et al. (2010) to epoch 2000 using a secular variation of \u22120.53% per year. These are plotted with previous measurements that were scaled to epoch  2000 by Hafez et al. (2008) using frequency-dependent scaling. For Tau A, we have scaled previous measurements from Perez et al. (2010) to the epoch of the WMAP data using a secular variation of \u22120.167% per year at all frequencies. Results are not significantly different if \u22120.22% per year is used.Table 17 presents parameters from fits to the spectra for WMAP data alone and for the combined data.

The flattening of the spectrum with increasing frequency was previously noted by Hafez et al. (2008). This may be consistent with observations of spatial variations of the spectrum in Cas A (e.g., Wright et al. 1999, Anderson & Rudnick 1996). Wright et al. (1999) presented spectra of 26 brightness peaks from maps with 7 \u2032\u2032 resolution at 1.5, 5, 28, and 83 GHz. The data were mostly consistent with power-law spectra, with spectral indices ranging from -0.75 to -0.95. (For comparison, the overall spectral index from a power-law fit to our integrated spectrum from 1.4 to 93 GHz is -0.73). Such a variation will lead to curvature in the integrated spectrum. Wright et al. (1999) also found curvature for some of the brightness peaks with the spectra progressively flattening at the higher frequencies, and noted that such curvature is expected from models of particle acceleration in cosmic ray modified shocks (Reynolds & Ellison 1992). Within the WMAP frequency range, all of the epoch 2000 scaled fluxes are consistent within the uncertainties with the fit to the combined data. This includes the WMAP fluxes, the absolutely calibrated fluxes from Janssen et al. (1974) at 22.29 GHz and Mason et al. (1999) at 32 GHz, the 33 GHz flux from Hafez et al. (2008), which is calibrated using the five-year WMAP Jupiter temperature, and the 86 GHz flux from Liszt & Lucas (1999), which is calibrated using the Ulich (1981) Jupiter temperature. Above 300 GHz, there is excess emission above that expected for synchrotron emission, which has most recently been interpreted as emission from cool dust by Sibthorpe et al. (2010). The 353 and 545 GHz fluxes from Archeops (Desert et al. 2008) are much higher than the 600 GHz flux from BLAST (Sibthorpe et al. 2010) and the 353 and 666 GHz fluxes from SCUBA (Dunne et al. 2003). The Archeops measurements were made with a larger beam (\u223c 12 \u2032 compared to \u223c 20 \u2032\u2032 or better for SCUBA and BLAST) and appear to be affected by dust emission that is not associated with Cas A.

These images are 4.15 \u00b0 on a side, have not been background subtracted, and are scaled such that brighter pixels are black. The polarization (P) image for Cas A shows an irregular \u223c 0.15mK ring at a radial distance roughly 40 \u2032 \u2212 50 \u2032 from the source position. The angular extent of Cas A is \u223c 5 \u2032 (Table 14), leaving the reality of the ring feature in question. We have attempted to simulate this feature under the hypothesis that it is an artifact introduced by a combination of beam and source spectrum characteristics. Cas A is a steep-spectrum source. As a result of effective frequency differences between the  two K-band radiometers (Jarosik et al. 2003b), the K11 radiometer (fed by the axial OMT port) has an FWHM roughly 3% wider than that of K12 (which is fed by the lateral OMT port), and the peak observed signal in K11 is a few percent higher than that of K12. Simulated beam maps for the  two K-band radiometers were generated separately using Jupiter data as a template, and then individually scaled to peak values representative of Cas A. The difference between the  two beams as a function of azimuthal angle and radial distance from beam center can be used to compute a rough estimate of induced Cas A polarization signal, under the assumption of complete scan-angle coverage.Figure 20 shows the results of such a simulation, which produces a feature with an approximately correct peak position (near 50 \u2032 ), but slightly wider and 30%-40% brighter than that shown in the data image. A more complete simulation would include scan-angle coverage effects, which in this scenario are presumed responsible for the gaps in the ring.

(1989a) and confirmed by the upper limits of Green & Scheuer (1992) in the infrared. Our adopted form for the spectrum transitions between a low-frequency power law and a high-frequency power law, and gives a good fit to the combined radio to infrared data. Our fit gives a change in spectral index of about 0.9. Additional steepening is needed to explain the observed X-ray spectrum, and Slane et al. (2008) suggested there is a second spectral break somewhere in the infrared. They presented model calculations in which the break at \u223c 100 GHz is due to a break in the electron spectrum injected into the nebula and the higher frequency break is due to synchrotron losses. 3C274 \u2013 The WMAP K-band flux agrees with that of Janssen et al.

Curvature in the overall spectrum might be expected since 3C274 has a steep spectrum  halo. Above 10 GHz, the contribution of the halo to the total flux is < 1% (Baars et al. 1977). Over the WMAP frequency range, the quadratic fit and the WMAP only power-law fit are not significantly different. The data of Ott et al.

The recommendation for using the Mars values needs to be tempered by the knowledge that these have been derived using mean seasonal properties only. The Saturn model is purely empirical, and can be improved with the addition of the 2009 and 2010 WMAP observations when the rings are nearly edge-on. Uncertainties in the seven-year mean Uranus temperatures range from 3% at W band to about 7% in K and Ka band; only the Q, V and W measurements are suitable for calibration at the 5% level. Some form of simple model including polar brightness effects would be required to extend the seven-year mean data here beyond the observing epoch, since longterm studies in the literature show clear seasonal temperature variations. There is also the surprising hint of a dip in the microwave spectrum near 30 GHz, where none is expected based on discussions in the literature. Seven-year mean temperature uncertainties for Neptune exceed 5% at all WMAP frequencies and so are not recommended for serious calibration usage. Flux densities in Stokes I for the five celestial calibrators have typical uncertainties of 1%-3%, and are in good agreement with previous measurements in the WMAP frequency range. For four of the sources, the WMAP data and other available data are consistent with a simple well-defined spectrum over  two decades in frequency or more. The WMAP observations improve the accuracy of the spectral fit parameters and in some cases they extend the frequency range where the object may be used for calibration. The uncertainties in the spectral fits are typically 1% or less in amplitude and 0.02 or less in spectral index.

The first one is the riders\" performance, the second one lies in the hardness of the race. Based on the number of racing days and the number of rest days per racing day, the Tour de France became much harder after the 1920s with the number of racing days stabilising up to about 20 . the number of stages was usually 15 at most and the riders enjoyed at least one day of rest after each stage. The overall riding distance was 2,428 kilometers in 1903 and rose to a maximum of 5,745 kilometers in 1926. Since then the distance shortened to about 3,500 kilometers on average. Thus, compared with the initial era of so-called \"road\"s convicts\" (les for\u00e7ats de la route in French), riders now spend more days on the roads and have less often time to rest. The race also became harder due to the introduction of mountain stages. The first mountain ever climbed in the Tour de France was the Ballon d\"Alsace in the Vosges region in 1905. A handful of years later, high-mountain stages in the Pyrenees (1910) and the Alps (1911) were introduced.

From 25.7 km/h in 1903 to 41.7 km/h in 2005 (the fastest Tour ever) is an improvement of 62%. Part of this acceleration is due to technical progress affecting riders\" bikes such as the introduction of derailleur gears, the increase in the number of gears, lighter bikes, profiled wheels, etc. (Calvet, 1981;Andreff, 1985). Improvement of the road surface, shorter stages, multiple stakes and high effort intensity in the crucial parts of the race have also triggered both higher rider performance and increased attractiveness to spectators. Improved physical and medical preparation, better nutrition, and sometimes doping may have played a role as well. Another index of riders\" performance is the withdrawal ratio, the percentage of riders who do not finish all stages of the Tour de France. This ratio decreased from over 70% in the 1920s . The highest withdrawal ratio was reached in 1926 (as explained above the longest Tour de France ever held) .

Over100 TV channels in 190 countries now broadcast the Tour de France, with live broadcast in 60 countries (www.aso.fr). Consequently, the Tour de France TV rights revenues have increased significantly over the years. In 1960, the French public TV channel started paying TV rights for broadcasting the Tour de France. The French broadcasting rights equalled or the French professional football league broadcasting rights over one season (\u20ac 668 million). No detailed information on the international TV deals is available, but in chapter 3 it was shown that the global broadcasting rights for the Tour de France probably amount to about \u20ac 50 million a year. As a result, the budget of the Tour de France has literally skyrocketed . the Tour operational budget grew from \u20ac 5 million to \u20ac 50 million (Mignot, 2013) primarily due to the growth of TV rights revenues that multiplied by 65 over the same period of time (from \u20ac 250,000 to \u20ac 16 million). In the past decade, the budget further increased from \u20ac 77 million in 2003 up to \u20ac 130 million in 2013. Table 1 illustrates the financing sources of the Tour de France. Basically, three types of income can be distinguished: TV broadcasting rights, merchandising and sponsorship revenue, and income from municipalities. The media success story is the basis for the solid economic foundations of the Tour de France because it provided 44% of its overall budget in 2010. Just like in other professional sports, TV rights are now an important source of revenue, resulting from an organiser\"s strategy of using its monopoly power over the Tour de France to increase these rights. This kind of revenues emerged in 1925-1929 when the Tour had transformed from a race opposing individual riders into a race between opponent teams sponsored by trademarks and commercial companies. Since 1930, additional sponsorship income was generated with the introduction of a publicity caravan, i.e. dozens of vehicles preceding the riders by a few minutes and distributing product samples to spectators (see chapter 1). The share of advertising and sponsorship revenue has declined in the past two decades to 51% of the budget in 2010. Finally, each year over 200 cities are a candidate for hosting a Tour de France stage arrival and/or departure . However, because of the rising overall budget the share of the contributions from these cities in the total budget of the Tour de France has decreased from 40% in 1952 to 5% in 2010. The Tour de France has thus also evolved towards a contemporary model of professional sports finance and developed from a so-called SSSL (= Spectators, Subsidies, Sponsors, Local) model to a MCMMG (= Media, Corporations, Merchandising, Markets, Global) model with regard to its major sources of finance (Andreff & Staudohar, 2000). In the MCMMG model, media, in particular through TV broadcasting rights, have become a significant source of income for many sports. Furthermore, alongside with sponsors and gate receipts (spectators) whose share in overall finance of sports events has shrunk, new sources of finance have emerged including corporations (investment funds, big companies, Russian oligarchs, Middle Eastern sheiks enriched by oil sales, \u2026), merchandising of non sporting goods (e.g. T-shirts) under a club\"s or a player\"s label, and markets. With respect to the latter, we see that money is channeled into contemporary professional sports from two markets: a labour market for talent in which a club makes money in selling home-educated and trained talented players and a capital market that enables to trade a club\"s shares at the stock exchange and collecting money from the fans as shareholders. Most of these new sources of finance are global."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

For example, its TV-dependence is slightly lower in percentage of overall revenues compared to football and merchandising and sponsorship (51%) is still a more important source of income to the Tour de France organisers than TV rights revenues. This may be interpreted as either the Tour de France being in a transition phase between the SSSL and MCMMG models, or as a consequence of the absence of gate revenue which must be compensated for by sponsorship money. In fact, the lack of gate revenue potentially deprives the Tour de France of up to a quarter (like in English football) of overall revenues. The share of public money received from municipalities is more important in the Tour de France than in European football though it is now reduced to 5% only. At the end of the day, the profitability of the Tour de France is likely to be guaranteed as long as it will attract media, advertisers and sponsors even without any spectatorship income."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

Finally, prerequisite (f) refers to the distribution of Tour de France prize money across different trophies and best-ranked riders. In the2014 Tour de France, for every lower position in the general classification the prize money was more or less halved between the first seven ranked riders: from \u20ac 450,000 for the winner over \u20ac 200,000 for the runner-up to \u20ac 100,000 for the third ranked rider, and so on to \u20ac 11,500 for the rider ranked in seventh place. A similar gap is assessed as a strong effort incentive in most individual sports tournaments such as, for example, tennis. With this incentive prize structure a rider who jumps from the seventh to the fifth rank multiplies his financial gains by four and the same occurs when a rider jumps from the third to the first place. The prize structure for winning a stage is similar with also approximately a doubling of the monetary reward for one rank improvement between the four best ranked riders. The prize structure for the other trophies is less in tune with tournament theory. In the race for the green, the white and the polka-dot jerseys, financial gains are not doubled when a rider improves his rank by one. These trophies thus clearly have a less incentive prize structure. If one ASO objective is to \"multiply the races within the race\" this must not go as far as disturbing the contention for the yellow jersey. That is the reason why incentives are significantly lower (\u20ac 25,000 for the green and polka-dot jersey winners, \u20ac 20,000 for the white jersey winner) and less structured according to the tournament theory for trophies that only appeal to specialised riders like sprinters or climbers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

However such perfect competitive balance is as much theoretical as the Noll-Scully benchmark of all teams having an equal 50% probability to win. Its practical interest is limited in the real world.

One is to refer to the coefficient of variation \uf073\uf020\uf02f\uf020\uf06d = \uf076.

The starting point is to basically assume that riders dope themselves because it corresponds to their deeply rooted economic and financial interests, and not because they are bad by nature, professional cheaters or criminals.Two papers written in the wake of the Festina scandal (Eber & Th\u00e9pot, 1999 andBerentsen, 2002) analyse doping as a result of a prisoner\"s dilemma, one of the most famous problems in game theory. In a nutshell, the doping game is a prisoner\"s dilemma adapted here to cycling where: a/ there is a (financial and health) cost borne by riders when they use doping; b/ the use of doping substances and techniques enables a rider to enhance his performances; c/ if, in an assumed two-rider race, both riders dope the final ranking remains unchanged compared to a situation without doping; and d/ if one of the two riders is caught, he will never denounce the other rider for being doped as well. Cycling the latter behaviour is known as omerta or the \"law of silence\": it is forbidden to openly talk about doping. In such a prisoner\"s dilemma, it can be shown that doping is a dominant strategy which means that it is always much more profitable for both riders to dope. The game theoretic literature about doping has also proposed several new anti-doping policy recommendations, all focused on providing riders reduced incentives to use doping. Eber and Th\u00e9pot (1999) advocate lower spreads between the prizes (which is in conflict with tournament theory), fewer races, improved testing and better prevention."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

For certain, it must not be considered to be a miracle solution. But the proposal at least focuses on a crucial point that could possibly be elaborated a bit further in forthcoming studies: the incentive scheme must convince riders that as soon as doping diaries are not differential between riders, doping is no longer a strategy that enables them to win more than their natural ability warrants. It may happen that there will be significant transition costs between the current anti-doping system and the one proposed here. In the first periods of the new regulation enforcement, some riders may feel or assume that the best performing doping programme is the most overloaded one. These riders might use substances dangerous to their health or life. If this assumption reveals to be true, they will soon be copied by other riders and lose their temporary comparative advantage. If on the contrary the assumption were to be wrong, or after a temporary increase in the number of sicknesses and deaths in the peloton (a sort of transition crisis between thetwo anti-doping systems, the hard price to pay for adopting the second one), all riders would be convinced that the best or optimal doping programme is in no way the most comprehensive or dangerous one in terms. It might be difficult though to convince stakeholders in cycling to enforce such a new regulation. Although riders would probably soon understand the mechanics of the embedded incentive scheme, they might be more concerned about the short-term effects of such a scheme on their health, i.e. when dangerous substances are put on the doping diary list (and subsequently used) by a large number of riders. But significant obstacles might also come from cycling governing bodies such as the UCI, Tour de France organisers ASO, and so on. They might especially fear the transparency about doping practices in the peloton that would result under such a regulation and its impact on the image (and thus the economic value) of cycling.

In other words, the defense mechanism preventing each of these acquired capabilities must be thwarted before cells become a malignant and invasive tumor . Hence, it is necessary address new strategies for cancer understanding and treatment. For doing so, establishing correlation between observable phenomena, as well as, observing if a particular intervention produces a significant response could be very useful to state hypotheses postulating which physical processes are involved and how they interact. For example, tumor cell proliferation (observable phenomenon) can be correlated to oxygen concentration (another observable phenomenon). Experimentally speaking, if we would modify the oxygen availability to observe whether cell proliferation is significantly modified, then we could estimate the oxygen threshold over which cancer cells begin to proliferate. Biological experiments needed to test such hypotheses can be time-consuming, expensive and/or impossible with current technology. In these cases, mathematical modelling plays a key role, providing an independent check of the consistency of the hypothesis and can also improve experimental design by identifying which measurements are needed to test a particular theory, and additionally, whether new hypotheses can be established from experimental results (see the review paper by Byrne ). In this regard, mathematical modelling is a theoretical description of biological phenomena that may be calibrated by experimental data comparison. Moreover, by changing the parameter values of descriptive equations, the significance and functions of variables representing specific biological features can be easily tested. Then, practically all tumor growth features can be mathematically modelled, reducing the biological modelling complexity and offering a powerful tool to better understand tumor biology, facilitating drug development and also pre-clinical and clinical patient management."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

However, considering that healthy tissue has approximately 7 % oxygen (53 mmHg) tension and the diffusion distance of oxygen in tissue is \u223c 100 \u03bcm , tumor growth is limited in size  and maintained during a short period of time. Under these conditions, the neoplastic compartment rapidly exceeds the diffusion distance of oxygen and becomes hypoxic. Thus, oxygen tension in a tumor can range from physiological (7 %) to severe hypoxic (< 1 % oxygen) or even anoxic . Moreover, the immediate molecular response to low oxygen is the hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) protein stabilization , which in turn triggers the expression of target genes involved in hypoxia adaptation such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In addition, under severe hypoxia, it is found surrounding areas of necrosis, which is a common characteristic of solid tumors. Nevertheless, quiescent cells generation in the periphery of culture dish was observed in vitro during a nutrient-deficient medium and hypoxia exposure in tumor cells . Therefore schematically, in the hypoxic phase, a tumor grows within the limits of its local environment forming three characteristic layers: 1) cells towards the center, deprived of vital nutrients, will die and give rise to a necrotic core; 2) proliferating cells can be found in the outer cell layers; and 3) a layer of quiescent (or hypoxic) cells, which survive without dividing with slow metabolism, is found between the two others layers.

Indeed, transition from the avascular to the vascular state, depends on the tumor ability to induce new blood vessels formation from the surrounding tissue. These blood vessels sprout towards the tumor and then gradually surround and penetrate it, providing an adequate micro-circulation and blood supply. Tumor-induced angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels develop from an existing vasculature, through sprouting, proliferation and fusion of endothelial cells, therefore is a critical step in solid tumor growth. Under hypoxia, cancer stem cells (CSC), that reside inside the tumor, could differentiate toward endothelial progenitor cells and mature endothelium, which in turn generates new blood vessels inside the tumor . This last process is called neovasculogenesis, and in the past was thought to happen only intrauterine, but nowadays it is known that this event happens also in adulthood. In cancer field, presence of CSC has been associated with tumor recurrence, resistance to chemotherapy, tumor metastasis, and in general with poor clinical prognosis . Tumor-induced angiogenesis is believed to start when a small avascular tumor exceeds a critical diameter (\u223c 2 mm), above which normal tissue vasculature is no longer able to support its growth. By the time a tumor has grown to a size whereby it can be detected by clinical means, there is a strong likelihood that it has already reached the vascular growth phase (see [10] and the references therein)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

For instance, it is well-known that increased density of blood vessels (the socalled \"hot spots\"), and high VEGF plasma levels are a powerful prognosis tool in many human tumor types. In fact, the capacity to modify this process has been considered as a keystone for cancer treatment, which includes some molecules that reduce the ability of TAF, and in particular of the VEGF, to provide blood supply toward the tumor and thus controlling tumor growth. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis  including 24 randomized trials with 8 different types of cancers, in which the synthetic antagonist of VEGF (Bevacizumab\u00ae) was used in combination with chemotherapy, shown a statistically significant improvement in the overall survival and progression of free cancer survival in patients who received Bevacizumab\u00ae compared with those who did not receive this drug. These beneficial effects were more evident in patients with colon cancer and renal cell carcinoma, but less evident in those who had breast, pancreatic or prostate cancer. This suggests that despite the overall benefit of Bevacizumab\u00ae, some patients and types of cancer are more resistant to antiangiogenic therapy.

We have carried out some numerical simulations of a tumor growth model under normal conditions, i.e., in absence of treatments. These simulation results are depicted in Fig. 2, which shows the distribution of endothelial cells (right), as well as, the distribution of the sum of the proliferative and quiescent tumor cells (left). The time unit is12 hours. Because of the configuration (four blood vessels initially placed far from tumor cells), the proliferative and quiescent tumor cells initially decrease, which can be clearly seen in Fig. 2. At the same time, this would produce an increment of the VEGF in the region where the quiescent cells are concentrated. This would trigger the proliferation of endothelial cells making them to move by chemotaxis towards the tumor (see Fig. 2). Further, as a result a lack of production in VEGF may be observed which it is thought to be consumed by endothelial cells. At this stage, the main effect is the reactivation of the proliferation of peripheral tumor cells due to high levels of nutrients in a neighborhood of the new blood vessels. However, after some time the oxygen concentration would be consumed by proliferative cells to levels that produce the usual distribution in three layers of tumor cells (see Fig. 3) described in the schedules of fully developed tumors .

As mentioned in Section Introduction, tumor cell proliferation can be correlated to oxygen concentration, and indeed one could think that the higher the oxygen concentration the higher the tumor cell proliferation. However, this is not always like that. In particular, elevation of anaerobic metabolism in tumor cells during avascular or even vascular tumor growth has been described, a phenomenon called Warburg effect, which involves a shift in metabolism away from oxidative phosphorylation (i.e., aerobic) towards anaerobic glycolisis. Therefore, tumor cells are resistant to hypoxia which indeed, depending on the threshold, may stimulate cell proliferation. In this regard, unpublished results from our lab using two ovarian cancer cell lines, HEY and UCI, were cultured under two different oxygen concentrations, 21 % (normoxia) and 5 % oxygen (hypoxia) respectively. Under these conditions, UCI cells were significantly more sensitive to oxygen variations than HEY cells. Indeed under 21 % oxygen UCI cell proliferation was accelerated about 3 times compared to 5 % oxygen, whereas in the case of HEY cells, the proliferation did not significantly change from both different oxygen concentrations (see Fig. 4). Considering these last results into . Data is presented as the logarithm of t 50 (replication time) \u00b1 SEM. N = 4 per group and analyzed time. *p < 0.05 vs HEY at 21 % oxygen. **p < 0.05 vs UCI at 21 % oxygen the mathematical modelling described before, net tumor growth rate in Eq. 8 need to be remodelled. In Fig. 4, it is clearly seen that UCI cells behave as one would expect, i.e., the higher the oxygen concentration the higher the tumor cell proliferation; in contrast, no matter the oxygen concentration, HEY cells undergo the same proliferation rate. Consequently, whereas net proliferation rate for UCI cells behaves as function defined by (8), one should modify the equation for HEY cells. In addition, parameters C hyp and \u03b3 0 could be estimated using the same experimental setting."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Quantity is either a Count, consisting of a value, or a Measurement, \nconsisting of a value and usually a unit.

In our very recent work, we have modelled and simulated resistance to two standard treatments: imatinib and sunitinib. In this regard, the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib, is used as standard first-line treatment. In most of the cases this drug leads to tumor reduction during several months, but then, most of the patients relapse and the tumor is no longer responding to treatment. Then the standard care switches to a second-line treatment using a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sunitinib), which has both cytotoxic and antiangiogenic effects. After use this second drug, metastasis is controlled for some additional time before a new therapeutical failure occurs.

In the mathematical models, we describe tumor growth evolution in terms of tumor area, as well as, its spatial structure and compared with the CT-scans measurements. We believe that intra-tumoral spatial heterogeneity may be related to an increase in the cellular activity, which would mean that a resistant phenotype should be emerging. Indeed according to our modeling, such heterogeneity may be seen as the first stage of the treatment failure, while Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) do not bring any information about this fact. Therefore our work can be seen as a first step in developing new tools to evaluate tumor response to treatment based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

This is not easy to deal with, because there are many differences in the expertise, nomenclature, language and even in the way of thinking that could slow down the communication. Then,one of the main challenges to be overcame is listening and learning each other, maintaining academic discussions where we could bridge the gap on these differences. With hope we have seen a growing number of publications and working groups which are seeking to combine science, but it is still insufficient.

In consequence, the model predicts that the population will increase exponentially, without limit. Whilst the exponential growth law is not realistic enough, it provides an accurate description of the early stages of a tumor development. In particular, reduced growth and eventual saturation are observed when avascular tumors are grown in vitro or when vascular tumors develop in vivo.
